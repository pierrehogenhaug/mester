We examined the decisions taken by the IFRS Interpretations Committee on November 26, 2019 concerning how to determine lease terms for automatically renewable leases and leases with no contractual expiry date. The IFRS Interpretations Committee confirmed that the enforceable period of a lease term must be determined based on the economics of a contract rather than just its legal form.

We present these non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. These non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and may have limitations as analytical tools. Non-IFRS financial measures not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures as presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We present non-IFRS financial measures for informational purposes only. The calculations for non-IFRS financial measures are based on various assumptions. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented. It may not be comparable to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or the other financial information incorporated by reference to this Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed upon such information when making an investment decision. We present non-IFRS financial measures because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. Non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. _Definitions of non-IFRS financial measures_ We define organic growth between one financial period (“period n”) and the comparable preceding period (“period n-1”) as revenue growth excluding: - changes in the scope of consolidation resulting from acquisitions, divestments and transfers of operations held for sale that took place during each of the relevant periods, as follows (it being specified that significant acquisitions are acquired companies whose annual revenue corresponds to more than 0.1% of the Group's consolidated revenue for period n-1): (a) for acquisitions completed during period n-1, the Group considers as a ""change in scope of consolidation"" effect the revenue generated by the acquired operations from the beginning of period n until one year after the date on which the acquired operations were included in the scope of consolidation; (b) for acquisitions completed during period n, the Group considers as a “change in scope of xii ----- consolidation” effect the revenue generated by the acquired operations from the date on which the acquired operations were included in the scope of consolidation until the end of period n; (c) for divestments completed during period n-1, the Group considers as a ""change in scope of consolidation"" effect the revenue generated by the divested operations during period n-1; and (d) for divestments completed during period n, the Group considers as a ""change in scope of consolidation"" effect the revenue generated by the divested operations from the date corresponding to one year before the deconsolidation of the divested operations until the end of period n-1. However, when the Group compares periods that are not full fiscal years (for example, six-month periods), it determines the effect on revenue of changes in the scope of consolidation as follows: (i) for (a) acquisitions completed during fiscal year n-1 but after the end of period n-1 and (b) acquisitions completed during fiscal year n but before the beginning of period n, the Group considers as a “change in scope of consolidation” effect the revenue generated by the acquired operations during period n; and (ii) for (a) divestments completed during fiscal year n-1 but after the end of period n-1 and (b) divestments completed during fiscal year n but before the beginning of period n, the Group considers as a ""change in scope of consolidation"" effect the revenue generated by the divested operations in period n-1. - The effect of changes in exchange rates (the “currency effect”) as described below. The Group calculates the currency effect on its revenue growth as the difference between (i) the reported revenue for period n, and (ii) the revenue for period n calculated using the applicable exchange rates for period n-1. The applicable exchange rates for any period are calculated based on the average of the daily rates for that period. - The effect of changes in accounting methods as described below. The effect of changes in accounting policies notably concerns IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which was applied by the Group for the first time as from October 1, 2018. We define Adjusted EBITA as recurring operating profit including share of profit of equityaccounted investees, adjusted for share-based compensation (stock options and performance shares granted by Group companies) and net amortization of intangible assets recognized on consolidation. We define Adjusted EBITDA as reported EBITDA adjusted for the impact of the share-based compensation expense. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA as a percentage of consolidated revenue. We define Adjusted EBITA margin as Adjusted EBITA as a percentage of consolidated revenue. We define free cash flow as the sum of the following items and recorded either as individual line items or as the sum of several individual line items in the consolidated cash flow statement: (i) Operating free cash flow, as defined below and (ii) Tax paid, which notably includes corporate income tax, the CVAE tax in France the IRAP tax in Italy and State Tax in the United States. Free cash flow is presented pre- and post-IFRS 16. We define Operating free cash flow as the sum of the following items and recorded either as individual line items or as the sum of several individual line items in the consolidated cash flow statement: (i) EBITDA, (ii) Net capital expenditure (i.e. amounts paid as consideration for xiii ----- property, plant and equipment and intangible assets used in operations less the proceeds received from sales of these types of assets), (iii) Change in net operating working capital, (iv) Other cash movements, which primarily comprise cash outflows related to (a) non-recurring items in the income statement and (b) provisions recorded for liabilities resulting from fair value adjustments recognized on the acquisition of consolidated companies.

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading international player in contract catering & services, serving 4 million customers every day at approximately 22,700 restaurants and points of sale across the world, and looking after 2,300 sites for clients in France through our services offerings. We have over 105,000 employees based in six main countries in Europe and North America, and a small presence in Asia. Our mission is to be a responsible caterer and facility management provider aiming for sustainable growth. Our contract catering business serves three key client markets: corporate entities and government agencies (Business & Industry), educational establishments (Education), and health and welfare establishments (Health & Welfare). We operate our contract catering activities in our traditional markets of France, Spain (including Portugal), Italy and the United Kingdom as well as in the United States since 2013. In every contract catering market we serve, we seek to tailor our services to meet each client and guest profile. In the Business & Industry market, our business model has historically been focused on providing outsourced contract catering services at our customers’ premises, where we prepare and serve meals at corporate sites (SMEs, blue chip), government offices, museums, stadiums and on board trains. In accordance with the size and requirements of the business, we deploy new operating models such as leveraging on our central production units (central kitchen) that we already used mainly in the education market as well as innovations and digital solutions to facilitate meal delivery. For example, we have developed applications for pre-ordering and paying for meals, which reduce wait times during peak periods. Another example of innovation is Food360, which allows an employee to order food on an application and receive the quality and balanced dish in the workplace smart refrigerator at the time desired. In the Education market, we operate the largest kitchen infrastructure in Europe, which allows us to combine high productivity with a local presence. We use local and certified organic food in our homemade recipes to promote healthy eating habits among our young guests. We provide catering and services for both public and private education from early childhood, day-care, school (elementary and higher), through to university. In the Health & Welfare market, we provide catering and services for hospitals, clinics, retirement homes and day-care centers for disabled, elderly and dependent (including home delivery). We tailor catering solutions to patients’ pathologies, adapting textures and personalizing nutritional protocols. Based on revenue generated in the year ended September 30, 2020, we estimate that we are the second-largest pure player in contract catering & services worldwide, with leading market positions in Europe and a growing presence in the United States. The majority of our services business is conducted in France and involves the provision of soft facility management solutions, notably cleaning, reception, concierge, light maintenance and grounds maintenance services. Through this business, we provide public and private-sector institutional clients with a wide array of outsourced solutions ranging from cleaning and ----- reception services through to the management of offices, hotels, shopping malls, leisure and vacation parks and office and apartment buildings. We estimate that we are the sixth-leading cleaning services provider in France and the number one provider of outsourced cleaning and hospitality services for the French healthcare sector. In the year ended September 30, 2020, we generated total consolidated revenue of €3,967 million, of which €1,778 million was generated in France and €2,182 million internationally, with €1,620 million from the Business & Industry market, €1,149 million from the Education market and €1,198 million from the Health & Welfare market. Our largest market by revenue is France, followed by the US. In the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated total consolidated revenue of €4,923 million, of which €2,212 million was generated in France and €2,689 million internationally, with €2,256 million from the Business & Industry market, €1,415 million from the Education market and €1,252 million from the Health & Welfare market. In the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations of €176 million of which €109 million in France and €90 million internationally. We are a listed company with a market capitalization of €1.2 billion as of June 28, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,,"Our business benefits from a number of competitive strengths, including: _Operating in large and stable markets with attractive fundamentals_ Our key markets of France, Spain and Italy where we enjoy strong, defendable positions and longstanding relationships with clients are historically among the largest and most stable markets for contract catering with high levels of outsourcing. In addition, we operate in the United Kingdom and United States which are displaying stronger growth and higher tendencies towards outsourcing of contract catering. We estimate the markets in which we operate for contract catering represented €124 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and we estimate that the outsourcing rate is 43% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market, or addressable market, is €53 billion. Outsourcing in the United States in the Health & Welfare market and Education market remains low – and offers significant promise for future business. Disruptions from new work practices in the Business & Industry market limits short term visibility on recovery prospects. However, the disruptions are expected to be offset in the med-term by adapting contract catering offerings. Key secular growth drivers that will provide our platform with new revenue streams and enhanced add-on options to boost margins include (i) outsourcing of contract catering as clients focus on their core business, (ii) concerns regarding food safety, hygiene, and traceability and (iii) an increasing focus on healthy, balanced, and high quality meals. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an acceleration in the longterm trends we have observed across our markets over the past few years and heightened demand for more flexible, grab & go and digitally enabled catering solutions and offers that are compatible with COVID-19 health and safety guidelines to prevent dining areas from becoming too busy, in addition to creating new offerings to respond to new consumption patterns such as working from home. Overall contracting catering operators are adjusting their business models and offerings to adapt to the changing market dynamics which will continue to drive growth opportunities in our contract catering market. We steadfastly focus on these growth drivers through our business. Firstly, we are well positioned to respond to the disruption in our Business & Industry market with the ability to leverage off our extensive central kitchen model and benefit from our modified atmospheric ----- packaging knowhow enabling longer shelf life and delivery capacities including the recent acquisition of Nestor in France to help capture the increasingly relevant small and mediumsized addressable market. Since the first lockdown we have accelerated the repositioning of our offer towards an asset-light model (connected fridges), combining digitally enabled services (ordering, click & collect) and a culinary offer revised for larger sites to keep up with consumer trends focused on healthy, balanced and high quality meals and nutritional transparency. Secondly, in the Education market, we are responding to the increasing focus on nutrition. For example, in September 2020 we introduced the Nutri-Score food rating system in our school canteens in France, making us the first – and only – contract caterer to have done so, and with our Safe Café concepts we deliver high health & safety standards, increasing customer confidence and capture rate. Thirdly, in Health & Welfare, we have developed ultra-personalized catering solutions by expanding our home delivery services and by rolling out senior-specific offerings such as Nutri-Age in Italy and Idequatio in France, focused on addressing the individual needs of our guests based on their nutritional requirements and capabilities. We are present in the markets and sectors that display high growth potential. The table below shows the outsourced addressable market in France, the United States, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. _Leading player in the contract catering sector with scale positions in its key markets_ We are a leading contract catering player in France, Italy, and Spain with strong market positions in the United Kingdom and United States, covering addressable markets of approximately €53 billion. The contract catering market is characterized by a large number of small and mid-size regional or specialized operators competing with a few national or international players. In our markets, critical mass is an essential competitive factor, as it creates the ability to offer prices that match market expectations. We are well-positioned as a market leader, and we estimate we occupy the #1 position in France, #1 in Spain, #1 in Italy, #4 in the United Kingdom and #5 in the United States, a market which offers attractive opportunities to further grow our footprint. We seek to partner with our clients, and we ----- distinguish our value proposition through the size of our offering, our ability to exploit economies of scale both in procurement (a key cost item permitting us to deliver contracts more competitively) but also in innovation. Our leadership is based on competitive pricing solutions, a more diverse and healthier offering range, and more efficient safety and hygiene regulation compliance. Our differentiated features attract a large and diversified customer base. Another pillar of our business model is our portfolio of brands which we operate including Elior, Serunion, Hospes and Corporate Chefs, both in France and internationally, which have built up a reputation for quality and excellence in their reference markets. As a result of our strong market position, we have been able to pursue targeted growth opportunities while also focusing on winning larger contracts that offer broader options for geography and services. _Resilience thanks to a diversified business mix, loyal client base and multi-year contracts_ We operate a resilient business model, underpinned by a diverse business mix, loyal client base, and multi-year contracts. The strength of our business is mainly due to the wide diversity of our operations, in terms of both business sectors and geographies. Our diversified business mix makes us uniquely positioned in contract catering during the pandemic because of the limited exposure to the disrupted white collars segment in our Business & Industry market (only represented 18% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019) and limited exposure to higher education in our Education market (only represented 3% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019). The table below shows the revenue for 2019 breakdown by market. ----- Our business mix is strengthened by our expansion globally. We have a growing international presence since 2014 and now operate in six countries. For the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated 45% of our revenue in France and 55% internationally, as compared to 56% in France and 44% internationally for the year ended September 30, 2014. After entering into the largest and fastest growing US market in 2013, we are the number five player today. The graphic below shows our revenue breakdown by geography for 2019 as compared to 2014. Furthermore, our business model is strengthened by the fact that we have a wide and diverse client portfolio. Our loyal and diversified customer base includes more than 14,000 contracts. Our retention rate in contract catering, for the year ended September 30, 2020, was 91.8%. We pride ourselves with building long-standing relationships with our clients, and we have been working with our top five clients for more than twenty years on average. Nonetheless, our revenues are diversified and we have avoided dependence on any single client, which provides our platform with the stability and strength to navigate changing market conditions. For the year ended September 30, 2019, our five largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 7% of total revenue for the contract catering segment, our ten largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 9% of total revenue for the contract catering segment, our fifteen largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue for the contract catering segment, and our twenty largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 13% of total revenue for the contract catering segment. Our 30-year track record of providing outsourced contract catering solutions to a ----- variety of markets for operators both large and small has permitted us to accumulate expertise which we deploy to tailor offerings matching customers’ specific needs with varying contractual features that promotes client stickiness and retention. Some of our selected clients include Trenitalia, SEAT, the City of Lyon, London Business School and Savannah State University. In addition, we offer favorable contract features. Our long term contracts have on average a five year duration. We maintain a balanced portfolio between public sector and non-public sector clients, with approximately 64% of our revenue generated by non-public clients and the remaining 36% generated by public clients. Moreover, automatic extension clauses and indexation based on prices of raw materials and labor costs contained in many of our contracts protect our margins. The loyalty from our clients is premised on superior service delivery as well as close collaboration together to drive bespoke solutions. More recently, our management deployed fast responses to COVID-19 with critical solutions tailored to specific needs – for example, keeping school cafeterias open to provide nutrition to children and maintaining services at factories, hospitals and other mission critical facilities. We adapted our contracts in line with attendance throughout the pandemic, which allowed us to seize the opportunity to improve contractual terms through targeted renegotiations based on local conditions. _Consistent financial performance_ At Elior Group, we maintain a sharp focus on financial performance metrics. We have demonstrated our ability to consistently grow our revenue over the years both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions, recording a consolidated compounded annual revenue growth rate of approximately 5.8% (of which 1.6% is organic) between the years ended September 30, 2013 and 2019. Additionally, we have maintained resilient EBITDA margins with the potential to further improve profitability. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2019, and 2020, our EBITDA margins were respectively 5.5%, 6.2% and 1.3% (pre-IFRS 16) (which would have been 6.4% as adjusted to normalize for the COVID-19 impact). Our revenue and EBITDA growth has been supported by our selective acquisition strategy and by our ability to generate continued organic growth despite difficult economic conditions. Our Cash Conversion rates (defined as EBITDA minus net capital expenditures divided by EBITDA) for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2019, and 2020 were respectively 40%, 62% and would have been 66% as adjusted to normalize for the COVID-19 impact. Our management keeps a sharp focus on strong free cash flow generation and pursues only EBITDA accretive acquisitions and capital expenditure initiatives that promise to capture new revenue streams. We believe that as a result of the foregoing, our efficient business model is characterized by good profitability levels, low working capital requirements, and stringent capital expenditure resulting in strong cash flow generation. _Well placed to benefit from supportive macro trends and return to normal_ Our business is resilient and poised to rebound as the stringent lockdown and social distancing measures imposed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are eased and as the rate of vaccination continues to increase in our geographies. Elior is well placed to benefit from macro trends which support the contract catering business generally and in particular provide further opportunities for revenue and margin growth based on our diversified platform, as proven in France between April 2020 and September 2020. Certain aspects of our business were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as offices and workplaces closed or reduced the number of employees present per day, particularly in France in the Business & Industry and Education markets, with number of meals served decreasing in the year ended September 30, 2020 to approximately 7% and 10% of year ended September 30, 2019 levels. The Health & Welfare market remained fairly resilient as a result of our support to hospitals, clinics and frontline workers who may have had an increased propensity to eat at on-site locations when ----- alternatives were closed, even though COVID-19 impacted the number of visitors in cafeterias, reduced capacity in hospitals, and reduced capacity in senior homes where new guests were temporarily not accepted. As lockdown measures began to be progressively lifted in May 2020, we experienced a significant pick-up in the French Education market with meal count recovering to 95% of 2019 levels by September 2020. Recovery in the Business & Industry market was more gradual with an increased proportion of companies’ workforce adjusting to new norms. Due to our business mix and the sustained focus by management in all of our markets to safely reopen sites when national legislation permitted us to do so, we have been among the most resilient players in the industry as compared to our listed company peers when 2020 organic sales are measured against 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the geographies and markets where we operate were affected in different ways. For example in France, the number of meals served sharply declined in April to June 2020 during the first lockdown but then continued to recover as restrictions eased, peaking at 86% in the month of September, 2020 compared to 2019 levels. Since fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we have recorded a more stable reduction in meal count and revenue compared to 2019. Recovery trends have varied across end-markets in the second quarter of 2021 with Education and Health & Welfare proving more resilient (Education meals served was at 92% compared to 2019; Health & Welfare meals served was at 87% compared to 2019; whereas Business and Industry meals served was at 44% compared to 2019). Our international business units are recovering at different paces on a country-by-country basis because of differing lockdown and social distancing easing measures and vaccination rates. Meal volumes in the US remained more resilient during the pandemic (around 85-90% compared to 2019 on average), supported by softer restrictions and good performance in Education (particularly K-12) and Health & Welfare. Recovery patterns in Europe followed similar trends to France. Italy’s resilience was supported by favorable Business & Industry exposure to industrials, while meals served in the United Kingdom struggled due to stricter lockdown measures. In terms of revenue, international activity levels dropped to 57% over the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower European volumes. Since the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue recovered to around 70% compared to 2019. In the short term, more favorable conditions are expected in the United States and the United Kingdom as vaccination rollouts advance. Throughout the pandemic, our decentralized and nimble management structure displayed its ability to pivot in accordance with local conditions and client needs. Management focused on structural cost optimization through contract renegotiation and labor savings to put us in a position of recovery from COVID-19. Contracts were successfully renegotiated for lockdowns and re-openings. These renegotiations included price revision clauses and menu reengineering along with flexible combination of production and service operating model (switching from on-site to central production) as well as contract extension to secure future revenues. We also adjusted field operations and organizational structures to activity levels. As a result, we believe we are well positioned post-pandemic with utilization of government supported furlough and technical unemployment programs. Elior’s restructuring plans include €103 million already provisioned in the year ended September 30, 2020, notably €68 million in France following the Group’s job redeployment plan involving an 1,888 FTEs workforce reduction. We expect that these restructuring initiatives will lead to a short term cash outflow with an approximately one-year payback period. Furthermore, management seized the initiative to opportunistically renegotiate key cost items, such as service contacts (linen, maintenance, insurance and vehicle fleet) and optimize site locations. Recognizing that meal volumes are dependent upon restriction measures taken to curtail the latest pandemic waves, management has concentrated on proactively reducing our cost base. During the first half of 2021, we operated close to EBITA breakeven and initiatives to maintain capital expenditures under control (approximately 1.5% of revenue) supported cash generation. A pick-up in activity following the reopening is expected to support meal count and ----- revenue expansion. As revenue recovers, we should benefit from significant operating leverage thanks to recurring reductions in our cost base secured during the pandemic. Our cost cutting initiatives gears us for further margin growth post-pandemic. Management deployed the various levers it has to reduce semi-variable and fixed costs through overhead, labor and occupancy cost reductions and renegotiations. We estimate that when volumes recover, the flow-through to EBITA for each €100 million of revenue generated will be approximately 25% to 30%. The illustrative direct impact of a revenue increase on EBITA increase (flow-through) is presented in the graph below. Elior remains confident that its platform and unique business model will provide it with the strength to seize opportunities emerging in the post-pandemic world. As we exit the pandemic, we are optimistic regarding both the short- and medium-term outlook. In the short-term, we believe that the United States and the United Kingdom are well positioned to bounce back sooner than France, Italy, and Spain due to the comparatively higher vaccination rate. September will be key given planned easing of restriction measures and structural seasonality. In the medium-term outlook, we believe that return to robust organic growth will be within sight. We further believe that improvement in our pre-crisis margins will be supported by structural cost optimization efforts. Permanent impact of work from home in Business & Industry volumes (around 20-30% of 18% of consolidated revenue) will be more than offset by new initiatives, new markets, and new clients. _Empowered local teams, underpinned by a strong entrepreneurial mindset_ We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our management team piloting a decentralized structure, underpinned by a strong entrepreneurial mindset. Our systematic control mechanism is deployed throughout the organization led by functional leaders. We are led by Philippe Guillemot, our Chief Executive Officer, who joined the Group in 2017 with particular expertise in running large organizations with a global footprint (especially in the US market) and building sustainable growth and operational excellence. Our senior management consists of the heads of our main country teams where we operate (France, Italy, North America, Spain, the United Kingdom), the head of our Services business and functional leaders who provide specialized direction and support for the execution of the Group’s strategy (finance, logistics, digital transformation, human resources and communications). Our ----- management has a long history of operating in the catering and retail industries along with an enviable record of long-term profitable growth throughout business cycles. In addition, our structure is lean with few layers between top-management and front line. This encourages strong commitment and entrepreneurial spirit across the group, permitting our organization to seize opportunities as they become available and evolve in line with our markets and clients’ business models. Furthermore, we believe our empowerment of local leadership in each of our geographies, along with our entrepreneurial mindsets, allows top management to agilely take decisions for clear and focused strategies. This has been shown through the management’s actions during rapidly changing regulations imposed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting our business. Through their direction and guidance, we were able to quickly implement procedures to protect the health and safety of our employees, clients and guests, anticipate and prepare for the post-COVID-19 environment through investing in new revenue streams and support the mobilization and engagement of teams on the front line. Our management also concentrated on strict cash management and a swift adaptation of the organization to keep us in a solid position. As a result of our organizational structure, local management can remain focused on the future and anticipating the needs of our clients.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strategies,9.3.1,,"Our strategic plan has been designed with the aim of navigating the pandemic and accelerate further deployment of the Group’s service offering. We intend to execute our strategy with a focus on customer-centric innovation fueled the knowhow and expertise developed across our global platform and with an eye on people alignment and empowerment to fully leverage the maximum impact of our talented employees and asset base. _Shift business mix towards attractive markets and clients_ Elior intends to continue a polycentric approach to growth. While continuing to grow our core French business, we have successfully expanded our international presence into geographies with growing contract catering outsourcing trends, especially the United States and the United Kingdom. We are now well positioned to gear new business development towards the most attractive segments and clients. This allows us to secure higher margins by converting selfoperated catering services to new outsourced contracts. We expect to expand and further create value for clients through innovative offerings with supporting digital solutions and entering new markets, such as on-board catering for trains and grouped meal delivers to SMEs. We will focus on selected country specific adjacencies to support growth ambitions across segments. Further, we will continue to improve geographic and/or segment mix in order to protect revenue impacts from poor country or market segment performance. We will focus on a select number of countries to target local markets yet share the best practices, recipes, and offerings, such as Food360, Urban360, and the roll out in UK with ‘pods.’ We plan on expanding our leadership positions across several market segment in larger geographies, such as the United States in targeted market segments, such as community meals and corrections. _Increase customer centricity through CSR and increase cross-sell/upsell in services_ We intend to increase customer centricity with a clear and proactive focus on CSR. We plan on focusing on new concepts, increasing use of digital technology to provide new customer services, and direct end-client to drive footfall in business & industry and education with parents. Our digitally inspired innovation will drive new opportunities in response to changing ----- customer trends. We continue digital innovation to complement traditional business & industry offerings because of the demand for high quality meals on-the-go, away from traditional catering settings. In France, Nestor allow us to expand the small and medium-sized addressable market. In the office, employees can use connected fridges and a click and collect app or have a delivery of fresh and tasty lunches directly to employees to enjoy in dedicated spaces. While working from home, Bites to Go allows employees the flexibility to take away via POS (fridges, vending machines or delivery). In the education market the trend is to focus on healthy, tasty, and nutritional meals in safe environments. Our innovation Weeky Daily is a click and self-service in schools and universities which offers teenager inspired meals in safe, social distanced spaces which increases our capture rate. In addition, Safe Café uses QR codes to deliver our health and safety standards which increases customer confidence and capture rate. The trend in health and welfare is personalized menus based on health and capabilities, available in traditional setting or at-home services. NutriAge is our innovation which identifies nutritional needs and delivers personalized plans, ensuring well-being for retirement home guests or the elderly via an at-home service. Further, Inéquatio adapts to people’s specific needs by ensuring the right food texture depending on their heath and capabilities. We intend to have an accelerated implementation of new offers for the Business & Industry market (asset light solutions, central production and digitally enabled services: ordering, click and collect, group delivery). We plan to increase capture rate with additional distribution formats and revised meus, such as grab & go and vegetarian expansion. We plan to continue to increase our cross-sell in our services through special works and facility management. For example, in the United States we have Kitchen on Demand initiatives. The Kitchen on Demand Strategy Council was put in place to leverage our cross-team collaboration to drive the full capacity utilization and expand footprint. Work streams were identified to accelerate entrance into new markets using cross segment teamwork. The pilot offerings were implemented across multiple market segments. _Systematic focus on retention_ Client retention is at the core of our business model and we are proud of the many clients we have been privileged to serve for many years. In contract catering, renewal of contacts often delivers better value for us and our clients as we are typically in the position to apply the knowhow gained in the previous performance of the contract, recalibrate pricing if necessary and adapt service offering to guest demand. Our strategy calls for reaching our target of 95% retention rate by continuing to strengthen our offer portfolio with existing clients, deploying systematic processes to apply lessons learned and improve our renewal pitch, and adopting various tools to monitor client satisfaction. We intend to proactively manage contracts and leverage new offers to retain smaller contracts (less than 150 meals per day) with new asset light formats. In Italy, we will drive retention rates with innovation showing new opportunities which include modified atmosphere packaging. This technology extends shelf-life of freshly cooked meals. We have untapped profitable opportunities up to 150 kilometers from our central productions units. _Continuous cost optimization_ We will continue to focus on cost control and efficiency measures, promoting a culture of constant improvement as an important part of our strategy. We intend to increase our share of centrally managed contracts to maximize volume rebates, while respecting local food traditions. We plan on optimizing food costs through maximizing the utilization of our central production unit capacity by, for example, which can be used to prepare meals that are served at other sites. We also intend to pursue optimization of overhead costs and selling, general and administrative expenses through shared services, right-sizing the layers within our ----- organization and investing in process automation where it makes business sense to do so. Though we have already made improvements in labor force rationalization, we believe there are still optimization initiatives that can be gainfully harnessed. _Focus on cash management and allocation_ Cost control and cash generation remain core to our management’s strategy for the Group. Our plan includes a strong focus on cash management and efficient capital allocation. To do this we intend to monitor capital expenditure, investing in accordance with strict payback parameters. Furthermore, we are rolling out initiatives to improve working capital. For example, we aim to reduce working capital swings once volumes recover. We intend to limit and have a one-year-payback on non-recurring expenses, including restructurings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Consequently, we are specifically exposed to loss or damage resulting from actual or perceived issues regarding the safety or quality of the food we propose. Any inappropriate preparation methods, production systems or behavior could harm the quality of the food services we provide. Claims of illness or injury relating to contaminated, spoiled, mislabeled or adulterated food may require costly measures to investigate and remediate, such as withdrawing products from sale or destroying supplies and inventory that are unfit for consumption. Our catering activities rely on strict adherence by employees to standards for food handling and catering operations. Claims related to food quality or food handling are common in the contract catering industry and may arise at any time. If we were to be found negligent in terms of food safety, we could be exposed to significant liability, which could have an adverse impact on our operating performance. Even if such claims are without merit, any negative publicity concerning food safety could damage our reputation and negatively affect our sales. Our catering activities also expose us to the risks inherent to the food industry in general, such as the risk of widespread contamination of foodstuffs, problems related to product traceability, nutritional concerns and other health-related issues. From time to time, food suppliers are forced to recall products and as a result the Group may have to remove certain products from its inventory and source inventory from other providers. Such events can be highly disruptive to our business. If any of the above were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

We are specifically exposed to a 26 ----- negative promotion of our image resulting from the communication of actual or perceived issues concerning our operations. If we are not properly prepared for managing a crisis, the occurrence of such a crisis could destabilize our business and lead to the loss of contracts. Any inadequate management of a crisis after its occurrence, or lack of communication over a report of an actual or perceived food safety incident that is broadcast on traditional and social media could call into question executive management’s handling of risk prevention processes. Certain events that constitute unanticipated crisis scenarios, by country or by business, could reveal weaknesses in our risk mapping and crisis management procedures. Any mismanagement of internal and/or external communications could damage our image and have negative repercussions on us, both for our staff and financial position. For example, existing or potential clients could decide to terminate or not renew a contract, or renegotiate their contract at a lower cost.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

With the sale of Areas, we have become the world’s second-largest pure player in contract catering & services, just behind Compass. Although our goals vary from one region to another, our aim is to double our operating presence in the United States. Our growth plan requires us to successfully implement new start-up and acceleration projects and to integrate new acquisitions. We expect to draw on our skilled, experienced managers at every level of the organization to ensure that our acquisitions are successfully integrated and that the related synergies are leveraged.

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Causes / Risks** **Consequences** **Impacts,13.2.3,The success of each of our businesses relies on our ability to generate organic growth by winning new business from clients who choose to outsource.,"A large proportion of contract catering and services business is generated from a competitive bidding process between the Group and several other service providers. In order to win a contract, we must be able to demonstrate our value proposition effectively. We therefore devote significant time and effort to preparing the bid or proposal for a competitive bidding process. A detailed analysis is carried out on the costs incurred during this phase, which are expensed if the bid is unsuccessful. Even if a bid is successful, we may not be able to fully evaluate the contract until operations actually begin. If any undertakings written into the service offering and/or the service contract signed with the client are not respected, this may lead to the loss of the contract if the client considers that it is not getting sufficient value added from the service provided. In addition, we may have to terminate a contract that is unprofitable. However, our ability to terminate our contracts may be limited. For example, our contract catering and services contracts with public entities are difficult to terminate because of certain contractual provisions that are required by law to be included in public sector contracts. If we underestimate the cost of providing our services under a particular contract and we are unable to terminate or renegotiate the contract, we could incur significant losses that could have an adverse effect on our business. As the parameters used for assessing the profitability of a future contract derive from the client’s specifications, these parameters cannot always be checked and, in addition, are subject to change Our competitors range from local small and medium-sized enterprises to multinational corporations. If our clients do not perceive the quality and cost value of our services, or if there is insufficient demand for new services, this could have an adverse effect on our business and earnings. Any failure to successfully adapt to these or other changes in the competitive and/or regulatory landscape could result in a loss of market share, decreased revenue and/or a decline in profitability. 29 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Causes / Risks** **Consequences** **Impacts,13.2.4,We are exposed to the risk that we may lose key contracts.,"We provide most of our services on a contractually outsourced basis at client sites. Contracts represent volatile assets as there are a range of reasons why they can be lost or terminated including competition, client insourcing, site closures. We conduct business with our contract catering and services clients under contracts that either have a stated term or may be terminated with advance notice. Contracts may be terminated, or not renewed, if one of our competitors offers the same service for a lower price or in the event of changes in market trends. Our business depends on our ability to renew contracts and win new contracts under favorable financial conditions. We cannot predict whether a client will choose to cancel a contract or allow it to lapse. Moreover, even if contracts are renewed, their new terms may be less advantageous than previously or they may require the Group to incur significant capital expenditure. Clients may also decide to insource the contract catering and/or services previously outsourced to the Group or to relocate their sites or change their strategy. The loss of a large contract or the loss of multiple contracts simultaneously could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial and operating performance. Furthermore, client dissatisfaction with the Group's services could damage its reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new contracts, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial and operating performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Consequently, although our contracts often include general, pre-drafted clauses, many of them also contain specific negotiated clauses, which can lead to additional liability. We use franchised brands in several of its markets. Lastly, activities carried out by the Group that generate low margins require a strict credit management policy. Some contracts may contain clauses that could incur our liability or result in us bearing risks that were poorly understood at the outset, which could have an adverse impact on its financial and operating performance. We are reliant on clients' ability to pay for our services. If a client experiences financial difficulties, payments may be significantly delayed and ultimately we may not be able to collect the amounts due under our contracts, resulting in bad debt write-offs.

We rely on the relationships we build up with our suppliers. In the event of a dispute with any supplier or if a supplier were to experience financial difficulties, deliveries of supplies could be delayed or cancelled, or the Group could be forced to purchase supplies at a higher price from other suppliers. In addition, a number of factors beyond our control or our suppliers could harm or disrupt our supply chain. Such factors include unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters (such as earthquakes or hurricanes), government action, fire, terrorism, the outbreak or escalation of armed conflicts, pandemics, workplace accidents or other occupational health and safety issues, labor actions or customs or import restrictions (such as those related to “Brexit”). 30 ----- Our catering business also relies on our ability to purchase food supplies and prepare meals on a cost-efficient basis.

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Causes / Risks** **Consequences** **Impacts,13.2.7,We are exposed to risks related to public procurement codes and antitrust law.,"Our subsidiaries are highly decentralized and often negotiate their own service-level agreements with public bodies, which themselves are subject to specific laws and codes. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with public sector entities. Business generated by public sector clients may be affected by political and administrative decisions regarding levels of public spending, particularly in light of the current attention in certain countries in which we operate to reducing national and local government budget deficits. We also have to respect certain legal requirements (for example, if we fail to pay our payroll taxes, we can be excluded from participating in tenders for public contracts). We have to produce various administrative documents (directors’ criminal record checks and various types of certifications) and we have to demonstrate compliance with all applicable legal obligations. We must also be vigilant to comply with anti-bribery and related laws and regulations and could incur liability if our policies and procedures do not detect any illegal acts. If we do not comply with the procedural regulations applicable to tenders for public contracts, our bid may be rejected or a successful bid could be challenged by the authorities or an unsuccessful competitor and the allocation of the contract to the Group canceled. This type of challenge to the allocation of a public contract can also happen when the Group has already begun work on the contract concerned. In such a case costs would be incurred (legal fees, business termination fees etc.) that would adversely impact the profitability of the operating entity concerned. In addition, any failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from participation in tenders for public contracts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

If we were to lose the ability to purchase from a key supplier, it would be more difficult for us to meet our supply needs unless we rapidly found a substitute supplier.

Operating agents may not record all of their sales and/or cash collected in the information systems provided, and large amounts of cash kept on site could be subject to fraudulent acts (theft, embezzlement, etc.).

In order to do so, we must structure our organization and operations appropriately while respecting the various tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which are generally complex. Additionally, because tax laws may not provide clear-cut or definitive doctrines, the tax regime applied to our operations and intragroup transactions or reorganizations is sometimes based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be challenged by the relevant tax authorities, which may adversely affect our financial and operating performance. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws and regulations may make it difficult for us to restructure our operations in a tax-efficient manner. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate may result in reassessments, late payment interest, fines or other penalties. The services the Group provides to its clients are subject to value added tax, sales taxes or other similar taxes. Tax rates may increase at any time, and any such increase could affect the Group's business and the demand for its services. This in turn could reduce our operating profit, negatively affecting our operating performance. Our international operating presence exposes it to the risk of being unaware of changes in local regulations and/or accounting rules (local GAAP and IFRS). Any failure to take into account such changes or to comply with the new rules would have significant financial impacts and could even result in errors in the Group’s financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

If there is an indication of impairment, an impairment loss is recognized, which directly impacts the financial statements. Impairment may result from a deterioration in the Group’s performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, a deterioration in market conditions, or adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations. The amount of any goodwill impairment losses recognized is expensed immediately in the income statement and may not be subsequently reversed. For example, the Group recognized a €63.7 million goodwill impairment loss in its financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2018. Any future impairment of goodwill would result in material reductions of the Group’s net profit and equity under IFRS. Furthermore, the Group may record deferred tax assets on its balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from differences between the tax and accounting values of assets and liabilities or in respect of the tax loss carryforwards of its subsidiaries. Recovery of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits, and the future results of the subsidiaries concerned. Any reduced ability to recover these assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax reassessments, or lower than expected profits could negatively impact the Group's financial and operating performance. Over time, the contract catering market has become very capital expenditure intensive (outlay on property, plant and equipment at production sites and points of sale). Consequently, our property, plant and equipment represent a significant weighting in our financial statements, which exposes us to the risks of obsolescence, physical deterioration of equipment, client restructuring or insolvency, loss of a major contract, or theft.

Understanding the expectations of our people (salaries, career development opportunities etc.) and ensuring that these are met are essential to our success. For example, 34 ----- if employees feel that the salaries and career development paths offered by the Group are inadequate this could lead to high staff turnover. The success of the Group’s operations depends on the skills, experience, efforts and policies of its executives and the continued active participation of a relatively small group of senior management personnel. If the services of all or some of these executives were to be lost, this could harm our operations, impair efforts to expand our business, damage our image and negatively impact our share price. If one or more key executives were to leave the Group, a replacement would have to appointed with the necessary qualifications to carry out the Group’s strategy, and if such a replacement were not available within the Group, he or she would have to be hired externally. Because competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive, the loss of the services of key executives and employees could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and our financial and operating performance. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to retain such key executives and employees. We rely on skilled and experienced managerial personnel at each level of the organization to ensure that our operations are carried out in an effective, cost-efficient manner. Site managers are the first point of contact with clients and are key to maintaining good client relations. They also have primary responsibility for evaluating and managing costs at each of the Group's restaurants and for guaranteeing service quality and compliance with client specifications. District, regional and national managers coordinate restaurants and ensure that large-scale operational plans and/or capital expenditure projects are carried out efficiently, in line with Group instructions and policies. Finally, we depend on our senior management’s skills and experience in coordinating our operations, implementing large capital expenditure programs and formulating, evaluating and implementing new strategies. If one or more executives were unable or unwilling to continue in their current positions, the Group may not be able to replace them easily or to provide their potential replacements with the necessary training and know-how in the short/mid-term to carry out their missions.

In relation to such implementation, (i) (x) the provisions of Article 212 bis and 223 B bis of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former 25% general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses (“rabot fiscal”)) and (y) Article 209-IX of the French Tax Code (the “Amendement Carrez” limitation) have been repealed and (ii) the provisions of Article 212-II of the French Tax Code (i.e., existing thin-capitalization rules) have been amended, as developed in more detail below. 38 ----- The other rules limiting interest deductibility generally remain unchanged, in particular the rules relating to the maximum deductible tax rate for interest paid to direct minority shareholders or to related parties in the sense of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code (Articles 39-1-3 and 212-I-(a) of the French Tax Code). Under Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount. French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by nonrelated parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group, as determined under accounting consolidation rules, to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own debt-toequity ratio. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the 39 ----- portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer from any related party) and at level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 included specific provisions which implement into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD II in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which are applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which will be applicable as from January 1, 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD II provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established and the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” (i.e., entities holding directly or indirectly in aggregate of more an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit) are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where such an hybrid entity is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax at its own level or taxable pursuant to Article 8 of the French Tax Code at the level of its partners or shareholders, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. 40 ----- The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may thus increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

The Issuer and the Issue Date Guarantor are dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries available to them, by dividend, interest payments on intercompany loans or other distributions to meet their obligations, including under the Notes or the relevant Guarantee. The amounts of such payments, dividends and other distributions available to the Issuer and such Issue Date Guarantor will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries as well as the ability of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer and the Issue Date Guarantor, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions, make interest payments on, or otherwise advance upstream loans to the Issuer or the Issue Date Guarantor to make payments in respect of their debt, including the Notes and such Guarantee.

The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of each of their Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such entities under applicable law, including a limitation to the extent that the grant of such guarantee is not in the entity’s corporate interests, or otherwise would result in violations of laws related to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value. Accordingly, enforcement of a Guarantee against the relevant grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the law applicable to it. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor thereof, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of such entity, may contest the validity and enforceability of a Guarantee on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that a Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations on guarantees apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such entity to the extent of such limitations. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. 42 ----- _France. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party_ obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor is a matter of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. The liabilities of a French company under a guarantee must also not be in breach of French financial assistance rules. The liabilities and obligations of Guarantors organized under the laws of France under the applicable Guarantee are therefore subject to (i) certain exceptions, including the exclusion of any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce, which prohibits a company from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of the acquisition or the subscription of its own shares and/or a misuse of corporate assets or of credit within the meaning of Articles L.241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French _Code de Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the issue of the Notes which the Issuer has applied for the direct or indirect benefit of the relevant Guarantor and/or to the controlled subsidiaries of that Guarantor (within the meaning of article L.233-3 of the French Code de Commerce) through intercompany loans and cash pooling arrangements (if any) that are outstanding and owed by such Guarantor (or any of its controlled subsidiaries) on the date a payment is requested to be made by the Guarantor. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes. _Italy. An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee) must_ receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and it is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration including in case of up-stream, downstream and cross-stream guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of such guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. The absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including the granting of a guarantee granted by an Italian company) ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest. _Spain. Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of “corporate benefit” expressly regulated_ under the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, However, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent company, when the obligations guaranteed do not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee. Certain decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of such guarantees to the extent evidence can be given that amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the guarantee or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to which such company belongs. However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an insolvency.

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of a future Guarantor. Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the France and the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation of each of the Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of creditors’ rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees.

In addition, under certain circumstances, the Guarantee of a Guarantor may be released automatically (see “Description _of the Notes—Limitations on Guarantees of Debt”), including, without limitation:_ - upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination) or conveyance, transfer or lease of the Capital Stock (as that term is defined “Description of the Notes”), or all or substantially all of the assets, of that Guarantor to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to the transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (as that term is defined “Description of the Notes”), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture; - in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of that Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any holding company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or through a holding company) to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and as a result of such disposition such Guarantor no longer qualifies as a Subsidiary of the Issuer; - upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture; - upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a holding company thereof) as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as that term is defined “Description of the Notes”) in compliance with the terms of the Indenture; - upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing; 44 ----- - upon repayment in full of the Notes; - the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization (as that term is defined “Description _of the Notes”);_ - in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “Description of the Notes— _Limitations on Guarantees of Debt,” the release or discharge of the guarantee by such_ Restricted Subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes; - as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”; or - as a result of a transaction permitted by “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants— _Merger and Consolidation.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

The occurrence of specified events that would constitute a change of control would also require early repayment of the New Term Loan and any drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, a failure by the Issuer to purchase the Notes after a change of control in accordance with the terms of the Indenture would result in a default under the New Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility and may cause such a default under the Group’s other indebtedness. If a Change of Control were to occur, the Issuer cannot assure you that the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement or other contractual obligations would allow it to make such required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing Notes, the Issuer will need to seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to purchase the Notes, or to attempt to repay or offer to repay the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any tendered Notes, which will be an event of default under the Notes. In addition, the Issuer may not have the resources to finance the redemption of the Notes and an early repayment of the New Term Loan required by a Change of Control, and currently the Issuer expects that it would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. The Issuer cannot give any assurances that it would be able to obtain such financing. The change of control provision in the Indenture may not necessarily afford investors protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving the Group that may adversely affect holders of Notes, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes.

The measures of insolvency for the purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceedings to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred the debt: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be sure as to what standard a court would apply in making a solvency determination or that a court would conclude that any Guarantor was solvent after the granting of Guarantees.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.

Thus, if the market interest rate increases, the price of fixed rate notes typically falls, until the yield of such notes is approximately equal to the market interest rate of comparable issues. If the market interest rate decreases, the price of fixed rate notes typically increases, until the yield of such notes is approximately equal to the market interest rate of comparable issues.

Our mission is to be a responsible caterer and facility management provider aiming for sustainable growth. Our contract catering business serves three key client markets: corporate entities and government agencies (Business & Industry), educational establishments (Education), and health and welfare establishments (Health & Welfare). We operate our contract catering activities in our traditional markets of France, Spain (including Portugal), Italy and the United Kingdom as well as in the United States since 2013. In every contract catering market we serve, we seek to tailor our services to meet each client and guest profile. In the Business & Industry market, our business model has historically been focused on providing outsourced contract catering services at our customers’ premises, where we prepare and serve meals at corporate sites (SMEs, blue chip), government offices, museums, stadiums and on board trains. In accordance with the size and requirements of the business, we deploy new operating models such as leveraging on our central production units (central kitchen) that we already used mainly in the education market as well as innovations and digital solutions to facilitate meal delivery. For example, we have developed applications for pre-ordering and paying for meals, which reduce wait times during peak periods. Another example of innovation is Food360, which allows an employee to order food on an application and receive the quality and balanced dish in the workplace smart refrigerator at the time desired. In the Education market, we operate the largest kitchen infrastructure in Europe, which allows us to combine high productivity with a local presence.

Additionally, the Group repaid the €210 million and $75 million that it had drawn down on its existing revolving facilities. _Payment of the 2017-2018 dividend – cash/stock dividend option_ The dividend for the year ended September 30, 2018 – which corresponded to €59.8 million (€0.34 per share) and was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the March 22, 2019 Annual General Meeting – was paid on April 16, 2019. Out of this total, €33 million was paid in cash and the remainder in new Elior Group shares. _Share buyback program_ In the year ended September 30, 2019, Elior Group used the authorizations given in the 15th and 22nd resolutions of the March 22, 2019 Annual General Meeting to launch a share buyback program with a view to canceling the repurchased shares by way of a capital reduction. For this purpose, on July 5, 2019, the Company signed a mandate with Natixis to purchase up to €50 million worth of Elior Group shares. At September 30, 2019, €50 million worth of shares had been bought back. 59 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

It has just under 1,000 employees serving 200 locations in 29 states. - Bateman Community Living (“Bateman”) is specialized in the seniors delivered food market, providing meals either at seniors’ homes or in congregate settings throughout the US. It has 550 employees and 200 clients. An aggregate €36 million in net goodwill was recognized in relation to these two acquisitions. _Acquisition of an additional interest in Elior North America_ In July 2018, Elior Group carried out a purchase of non-controlling interests in its subsidiary, Elior North America. This transaction enabled the Group to simplify Elior North America’s ownership structure by purchasing shares from the subsidiary’s minority shareholders. On completion of the transaction, Elior Group’s stake in Elior North America increased from 74% to 92% in return for a cash payment of $115 million (converting to €99 million at the transaction date). Elior North America’s minority shareholders still hold an aggregate 8% interest in the company, which is covered by cross put and call options exercisable from 2023. The put liability has been recognized in consolidated equity in an amount corresponding to the present value of the option’s exercise price. _Dividend payment by Elior Group on April 17, 2018_ The dividend for the year ended September 30, 2017 – which corresponded to €72.5 million (€0.42 per share) and was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the March 9, 2018 Annual General Meeting – was paid on April 17, 2018. Out of this total, €36.3 million was paid in cash and the remainder in Elior Group shares. _Change in governance_ On October 31, 2017, Philippe Salle – the Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer – stepped down from his post. Following a decision taken by Elior Group's Board of Directors on July 26, 2017 to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilles Cojan - who was appointed by the Board as a director - was named Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Pedro Fontana was appointed as the Group's Interim Chief Executive Officer, both with effect from November 1, 2017. Subsequently, at its meeting on December 5, 2017, the Board appointed Philippe Guillemot as the Group’s Chief Executive Officer and Pedro Fontana became Deputy Chief Executive Officer. Pedro Fontana resigned end of March 2018. _Senior Facilities Agreement Amend & Extend transaction_ 60 ----- On April 20, 2018, Elior Group and Elior Participations signed an 11th amendment to the Senior Facility Agreement with their lending banks, extending the maturities of some of the Senior Facility Agreement’s term loans to May 2023. Following the amend and extend, all such debt was carried solely by Elior Group except for the revolving credit facilities which could be drawn down by Elior Group and/or Elior Participations. In addition, the interest payable on the US dollar-denominated facilities was decreased by 5 basis points. The aggregate amount of the facilities affected by this rate cut was $594 million. Lastly, the maximum drawdown on the euro-denominated revolving credit facility was raised by €150 million to €450 million. The above changes were accounted for as simple modifications without any extinguishment of the Group’s existing debt. _Capital increase_ In application of the 31st resolution adopted at the March 9, 2018 Annual General Meeting, Elior Group launched its first international employee share ownership plan, called the “Future Plan.” A total of 1,059,846 new Elior Group shares were purchased by employees under the plan, corresponding to a capital increase of €15 million (which took place in April 2018). _Presentation of Elior Group’s 2019-2021 strategic plan_ At Elior Group’s Investor Day held on June 26, 2018, CEO Philippe Guillemot presented the Group’s new strategic plan, covering the three fiscal years until September 30, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Consolidated revenue generated in France totaled €890 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021, an 18.1% organic contraction (no material impact from acquisitions or divestments) as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2020. Business & Industry held 62 ----- up better than in most other countries. Although working-from-home remained the norm when possible in the first half of 2021, we have seen service-sector workers desire to return to the office. The Education market stayed relatively well oriented in the first half of the current fiscal year as the public authorities in France kept schools open throughout the period. The Corporate & Other segment, which includes the Group’s remaining concession catering activities not sold with Areas, generated very weak first half revenue due to state-enforced business closures. International operations accounted for 52% of consolidated revenue in the six months ended March 31, 2021, compared with 56% for the six months ended March 31, 2020. International revenue declined 28.4% to €979 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021. This change comprised a 25.3% organic decline as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2020 and a 3.1% currency headwind attributable to the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. There was no material impact from acquisitions or divestments. All the countries where we operate were affected by the stricter public health measures taken since the previous fall to stem a spike in the global COVID-19 pandemic. The UK was particularly impacted by the strict lockdown imposed on January 4, 2021 and still mostly in place as of March 31, 2021 although schools were reopened in early March. Italy was also affected but proved more resilient than other countries thanks to a Business & Industry client mix largely skewed towards the industrial sector, thus less exposed to those working-from-home. The following table shows a revenue breakdown between the Group’s three main markets and the growth rates by market for the periods indicated: Business & Industry .................. 617 1,056 (40.4)% 0.0% (1.1)% (41.5)% Education .................................. 679 788 (11.8)% 0.1% (2.1)% (13.9)% Health & Welfare ....................... 572 615 (4.5)% 0.0% (2.5)% (7.0)% GROUP TOTAL ........................** 1,869 2,459 (22.3)% 0.0% (1.7)% (24.0)% The Business & Industry market generated revenue of €617 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021, a 41.5% decrease as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2020. The Business & Industry market remained particularly impacted by public health measures that recommended, or even required, working-from-home. The 36.9% organic decline in the second quarter of the year ending September 30, 2021 was smaller than in the first (-43.5%), mainly reflecting a more favorable year-on-year comparison in the second quarter as we lapped the one-year anniversary of the first lockdown measures. The Education market generated revenue of €679 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021, down 13.9% as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2020. The Education market is more resilient than the Business & Industry market yet has still been impacted by stricter public health measures in all the countries where we operate. The Health & Welfare market generated revenue of €572 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021, a decrease of 7.0% as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2020. Contract catering continues to suffer from the closure of areas usually open to the public, such as hospital cafeterias. On the other hand, Elior Services, which provides cleaning and hygiene services for production areas and highly specific environments such as white rooms, remains resilient, thanks to solutions specifically adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic. 63 ----- _Purchase of raw materials and consumables_ Purchase of raw materials and consumables decreased by €219 million, or 27.5%, from €797 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020 to €578 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021, reflecting the period-on-period contraction in consolidated revenue. As a percentage of revenue, Purchase of raw materials and consumables represented 30.9% in the six months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to 32.4% in the six months ended March 31, 2020. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs for continuing operations decreased by €231 million, or 18.7%, from €1,234 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020 to €1,003 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021. As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs represented 53.7% in the six months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to 50.2% in the six months ended March 31, 2020. Personnel costs for continuing operations include share-based compensation expense, which relates to long-term compensation plans put in place in the Group's French and international subsidiaries. Share-based compensation expense represented a nil amount in the six months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020. Excluding share-based compensation expense, personnel costs were €229 million lower for the six months ended March 31, 2021, at €1,003 million compared with €1,232 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020. This period-on-period decrease was primarily due to the decline in consolidated revenue. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses for continuing operations decreased by €55 million, or 22%, from €250 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020 to €195 million for the six months ended March 2021. This period-on-period decrease reflects the decline in consolidated revenue in the six months ended March 31, 2021. _Taxes other than on income_ Taxes other than on income decreased by €7 million, or 16% from €43 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020 to €36 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021. _Depreciation, amortization and provisions for recurring operating items_ Depreciation, amortization and provisions for recurring operating items recorded by continuing operations edged down €3 million, or 3.7%, from €84 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020 to €81 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021. This decrease mainly stemmed from the restructuring measures launched in the year ended September 30, 2020 as well as a much lower level of capital expenditure since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. _Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations_ The following table sets out adjusted EBITA by segment and as a percentage of the revenue of each segment. 64 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Adjusted EBITA margin was -1.3% compared with +2.1% in the six months ended March 31, 2020, reflecting the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted EBITA drop-through was 14% (at constant exchange rates) in the six months ended March 31, 2021, a significant improvement compared to 22% in the six months ended March 31, 2020, attributable to our rigorous focus and agility in controlling operating costs. In the International segment, Adjusted EBITA was a loss of €12 million in the six months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to a €26 million profit in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -1.2% in the six months ended March 31, 2021, compared with +1.9% in the six months ended March 31, 2020. In France, Adjusted EBITA was a loss of €4 million in the six months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to a €37 million profit in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The Education and Health & Welfare markets proved more resilient to the pandemic than the Business & Industry market. The Corporate & Other segment’s Adjusted EBITA was a loss of €9 million in the six months ended March 31, 2021, an improvement on the €11 million loss in the six months ended March 31, 2020. _Recurring operating profit from operations including share of profit from equity-accounted investees_ This item represented a €34 million loss in the six months ended March 31, 2021 compared with profit of €40 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The six months ended March 31, 2021 figure includes €9 million in amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, compared with €10 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. _Non-recurring income and expenses, net_ Non-recurring items represented a net expense of €3 million in the six months ended March 31, 2021 versus a net expense of €6 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. For both periods, the total chiefly includes costs incurred in France and abroad related to restructurings and business stoppages. _Financial income and expenses, net_ Net financial expense for continuing operations amounted to €20 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021 compared with €17 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020. 65 ----- This period-on-period increase was primarily attributable to (i) the higher amount of average debt under the SFA in the six months ended March 31, 2021 compared with the six months ended March 31, 2020 and (ii) the impact of fair value adjustments made to the SFA debt following the change in the applicable interest rates as a result of the covenant holiday obtained in November 2020. This holiday lasts until September 30, 2022, which is now the date of the next covenant test. _Income tax_ Income tax expense, excluding the French CVAE tax on value added generated by the business, is recognized based on Management's estimate of the average annual income tax rate for the full fiscal year. The estimated average tax rate for the year ending September 30, 2021 which was used to calculate the income tax expense for the six months ended March 31, 2021 was 12%. The estimated rate applied for the six months ended March 31, 2020 was 22%. The Group recorded a €4 million income tax benefit for the six months ended March 31, 2021 versus a €15 million income tax expense for the six months ended March 31, 2020. This €19 million period-on-period change was mainly due to a sharp €74 million drop in pre-tax profit, which resulted in the Group recording a pre-tax loss, and (ii) a reduction in the French CVAE tax from €9 million to €7 million. _Loss for the period from discontinued operations_ The Group recorded a €3 million net loss from discontinued operations in the six months ended March 31, 2021, versus a €20 million net loss in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The six months ended March 31, 2021 figure chiefly stemmed from the remaining Concession Catering activities that were not included in the sale of Areas and which are in the process of being sold by the Group. In the six months ended March 31, 2021, loss for the period from discontinued operations primarily included the impact of a €20 million additional price adjustment for the sale of the Concession Catering division, relating to working capital. _Attributable profit for the period and earnings per share_ As a result of the factors described above, the Group’s attributable net loss for the six months ended March 31, 2021 amounted to €56 million, versus a loss of €18 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020. Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations came to a loss of €0.29 for the six months ended March 31, 2021 compared with earnings of €0.02 for the six months ended March 31, 2020. _Adjusted attributable profit for the period_ Adjusted attributable net profit/(loss) for the period corresponds to consolidated net profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent adjusted for the following: (i) ""Non-recurring income and expenses, net"", (ii) goodwill impairment losses and net amortization of intangible assets recognized on consolidation in relation to acquisitions, (iii) exceptional impairment of investments in and loans to nonconsolidated companies, and (iv) the impact of the capital gains and losses on sales of consolidated companies recognized in “Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations”, with all of these adjustments being net of tax. 66 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

This 19.4% year-on-year decrease reflects a loss in revenue of (i) €1,003 million due to the COVID19 crisis, (ii) -€11 million due to strikes in France at the end of the first quarter and start of the second quarter and (iii) -€39 million due to voluntary contract exits in Italy and scope reduction in the Tesco contracts in the United Kingdom. Without these various exceptional impacts, Elior’s organic growth was +1.7%. Acquisitions in the US and Italy contributed €4 million, while foreign exchange, notably the US dollar, added €8 million to consolidated revenue from continuing operations. The proportion of revenue generated by international operations was 55% in the year ended September 30, 2020, same as with the previous fiscal year. International revenue was €2,182 million, a decline of 18.9% compared to last year, reflecting the €551 million impact of COVID-19 and – to a much lesser extent – the Italian public-sector contracts that we chose not to renew last year and the scaled back Tesco contracts in the UK. Excluding those items, Elior’s International organic revenue growth was 2.6%. The US was the most resilient geography owing to Elior being less exposed to the Business & Industry market, our strong position in the National School Lunch Program from K-to-12 children and our ability to increase our use of existing capacity to support social services organizations. Foreign exchange, notably a stronger US dollar, added +0.3% to international revenue compared to last year. Revenue generated in France totaled €1,778 million in the year ended September 30, 2020, compared with €2,212 million in the year ended September 30, 2019, a decline of 19.6%. Elior Services has deployed its bio-cleaning expertise, including certified COVID-19 specific solutions, particularly in the Health & Welfare, but also in services and industrial sectors. Excluding the €11 million impact from strikes and the €445 million impact from COVID-19, organic revenue was flat for France. The Corporate & Other segment, which includes the Group’s remaining concession catering activities not sold with Areas, generated €7 million in revenue in the year ended September 30, 2020, down from €22 million for the in the year ended September 30, 2019 notably due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Education generated revenue of €1,149 million in the year ended September 30, 2020, a decline of 18.7% for the full year 2019-20, compared to the year ended September 2019, again due to the COVID-19 impact. Health & Welfare revenue stood at €1,198 million, a decline of 4.4% compared to the year ended September 30, 2019. This market was the least impacted by COVID-19. _Purchase of raw materials and consumables_ This item decreased by €270 million from €1,557 million in the year ended September 30, 2019 to €1,287 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 reflecting the year-on-year decrease in consolidated revenue. As a percentage of revenue, ""Purchase of raw materials and consumables"" edged up from 31.6%. to 32.4% in the year ended September 30, 2020. This year-on-year rise reflects an increased use of sanitizing products and protective equipment as a result of COVID-19 (the costs of which were partly passed on to clients). _Personnel costs_ Excluding share-based compensation, personnel costs for continuing operations decreased by €358 million year on year, from €2,436 million to €2,077 million. However, as a percentage of revenue, they increased slightly from 49.5% to 52.4%. The figure for the Contract Catering & Services business line (excluding share-based compensation) fell by €349 million from €2,402 million to €2,053 million, primarily attributable to the decrease in consolidated revenue. 69 ----- Personnel costs for continuing operations include share-based compensation, which relates to long-term compensation plans put in place in the Group's French and international subsidiaries. Share-based compensation represented a nil amount in the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to income of €5 million in the year ended September 30, 2019. The figures for both fiscal years include (i) the estimation that the objectives set for the June 15, 2018 performance share plan would not be achieved, and (ii) the re-estimation of the liability related to (a) the Elior North America stock option plan for the year ended September 30, 2019 and (b) the July 24, 2019 performance share plan for the year ended September 30, 2020. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses for continuing operations decreased by €141 million, or 25.2%, from €561 million to €420 million. This decrease was due to the decline in consolidated revenue in the year ended September 30, 2020 and the cancellation of €59 million in lease payments following the first-time application of IFRS 16. _Taxes other than on income_ This item remained stable year on year, at €71 million. _Depreciation, amortization and provisions for recurring operating items_ Depreciation, amortization and provisions for recurring operating items recorded by continuing operations rose by €56 million, or 45.9%, from €122 million to €178 million. This increase mainly stemmed from the amortization of right-of-use assets following the first-time application of IFRS 16. _Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations_ The following table sets out Adjusted EBITA by segment and as a percentage of the revenue of each segment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

As a result of the €245 million year-on-year decline, the Adjusted EBITA margin was -1.7% for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to +3.6% in the year ended September 30, 2019. The French strikes accounted for -€7 million, voluntary contract exits in Italy, contract terminations with the Ministry of Defense and Tesco contracts scope reduction in the UK together accounted for €5 million, while the COVID-19 pandemic impact was -€268 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Elior had estimated that the COVID-19 drop-through from revenue to Adjusted EBITA would be less than 30% over the full year. The actual final drop-through was 27%. 70 ----- In the International segment, Adjusted EBITA totaled a negative €30 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, compared to a positive €90 million a year ago, notably due to the major impact of COVID-19. Adjusted EBITA as a percentage of revenue was -1.4% for the year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to 3.3% for the year ended September 30, 2019. In France, Adjusted EBITA came to a negative €13 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to a positive €109 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. Tighter operational discipline and greater commercial selectivity by the management team helped to offset the impact of the general labor strikes in France but business was severely impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown measures. Health & Welfare was less affected despite the closures of hospital cafeterias. The Adjusted EBITA as a percentage of revenue was -0.7%, compared to 4.9% year ago. The Corporate & Other Adjusted EBITA was a negative €26 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to a negative €23 million for the year ended September 30, 2019, mostly due to the impact of COVID-19. _Recurring operating profit from operations including share of profit from equity-accounted investees_ Recurring operating loss from continuing operations (including share of profit of equityaccounted investees), was €89 million for the full year 2019-20, which included an IFRS 16 benefit of €2 million, compared with a profit of €160 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The figure for the year ended September 30, 2020 includes €20 million in amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, compared to €21 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. _Non-recurring income and expenses, net_ Non-recurring items represented a net expense of €240 million. This amount primarily included (i) €123 million in goodwill impairment losses recognized for Italy and the UK, and (ii) €103 million mainly related to provisions for restructuring costs, notably a €68 million provision recognized in France following the Group’s announcement on September 30, 2020 of a job redeployment plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l’Emploi). In fiscal 2018-19, non-recurring items represented a net expense of €27 million and mainly related to restructuring costs. _Financial income and expenses, net_ Net financial expense was -€38 million, which included an IFRS 16 impact of -€7 million in the year ended September 30, 2019. This compared to -€69 million a year ago, due to the reduction in debt following the sale of Areas in 2018-19, and the impact of the lower leverage ratio on the margin. _Income tax_ Income tax expense amounted to €83 million in the year ended September 30, 2020, including an IFRS 16 benefit of €3 million, compared to a net benefit of €4 million resulting from a shortterm tax loss on the divestment of Areas in 2018-19. In 2020, the Group only recognized a portion of the tax benefit arising from its net loss in the year ended September 30, 2020 and it wrote down (mainly in France) a significant portion of its deferred tax assets recognized in prior years, following an update to its profit projections. For the year ended September 30, 2020 income tax expense also includes €19 million for the French CVAE tax, which is based on added value and therefore decreased for the year ended September 30, 2020 as compared with €21 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. 71 ----- _Loss for the period from discontinued operations_ The Group recorded a €37 million net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended September 30, 2020, compared to net profit of €202 million in the year ended September 30, 2019, primarily reflecting the net price adjustment for the sale of Areas (corresponding to the Group’s Concession Catering business). On the completion of this sale, which took place on July 1, 2019, the Group recognized a €208 million net capital gain before final price adjustments. _Attributable profit for the period and earnings per share_ In view of the factors described above, in the year ended September 30, 2020, the Group recorded a €483 million net loss for the period attributable to owners of the parent, versus attributable net profit of €271 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. This represented a basic and diluted loss per share of €2.78 for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of €1.54 and €1.53 respectively for the year ended September 30, 2019. _Adjusted attributable profit for the period_ Adjusted attributable net profit for the period corresponds to consolidated net profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent adjusted for the following: (i) ""Non-recurring income and expenses, net"", (ii) goodwill impairment losses and net amortization of intangible assets recognized on consolidation in relation to acquisitions, (iii) exceptional impairment of investments in and loans to non-consolidated companies, and (iv) the impact of the capital gains and losses on sales of consolidated companies recognized in “Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations”, with all of these adjustments being net of tax.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Organic growth for the fiscal year was a negative 0.8%. Recent acquisitions contributed €66 million to revenue — of which €65 million generated in the United States — representing acquisition-led growth of 1.4%. The currency effect was a positive 1.3% and the Group's firsttime application of IFRS 15 had a 1.0% negative impact. International revenue rose 0.4% to €2,689 million. Organic growth for this segment was a negative 2.9%, of which (i) 1.6% was due to the Group’s decision not to renew public-sector contracts in Italy, and (ii) 2.2% related to the termination of contracts with the Ministry of Defense and the reduced scope of the Tesco contracts in the United Kingdom, as well as the loss of the Alabama Department of Social Services contract in the United States. In Spain, sales momentum was primarily driven by new market segments and new contract ramp-ups in Business & Industry and Health & Welfare, which more than offset the effect of site closures in the Education market. In Italy, the business development strategy put in place for the private sector and new market segments is now beginning to bear fruit. Recent acquisitions generated additional growth of 2.5% for international operations, mainly in the United States, and changes in exchange rates had a positive 2.3% impact. The calendar effect was slightly favorable during year. Revenue generated in France totaled €2,212 million, with organic growth of 1.8%. - The Business & Industry market saw good performances from existing sites, with sales momentum picking up pace in the second half of the year thanks to a highly customercentric approach. - The revenue figure posted by the Education market reflects the Group’s more selective sales policy, particularly for delivered meals. 74 ----- - The Health & Welfare market turned in a solid showing, led by a good level of client retention and business development. The Corporate & Other segment – which includes the Group’s remaining concession catering activities that were not sold with Areas – generated €22 million in revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019, slightly down on the previous year. _Purchase of raw materials and consumables_ This item totaled €1,557 million in the year ended September 30, 2019, unchanged from the previous year despite the year-on-year revenue increase generated by acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, “Purchase of raw materials and consumables” improved slightly in the year ended September 30, 2019, edging down from 31.9%. to 31.6%. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs for continuing operations – excluding share-based compensation – increased by €12 million, or 0.5%, year on year, from €2,419 million to €2,431 million. However, as a percentage of revenue, they decreased slightly from 49.5% to 49.4%. Personnel costs for the Contract Catering & Services business line rose by €46 million, or 1.9%, from €2,390 million to €2,436 million. This absolute-value increase was notably due to salary increases in the United States and the impact of recent acquisitions (€17 million). Share-based compensation expense Share-based compensation – which relates to long-term compensation plans put in place in the Group's French and international subsidiaries – represented income of €5 million in the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to a €29 million expense in the year ended September 30, 2018. The year ended September 30, 2019 income figure primarily reflects (i) the estimation at September 30, 2019 of the non-achievement of the objectives set for the June 15, 2018 performance share plan, and (ii) the re-estimation of the liability related to the Elior North America stock option plan. The expense recorded in the year ended September 30, 2018 mainly related to the Elior North America stock option plan. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses for continuing operations decreased by €3 million (representing a 0.5% improvement) from €564 million to €561 million, including the impact of the Group’s adoption of IFRS 15. _Taxes other than on income_ This item decreased by €3 million, or 4.1%, from €74 million to €71 million, reflecting the exemption from the apprenticeship tax in France in 2019. _Depreciation, amortization and provisions for recurring operating items_ Depreciation, amortization and provisions for recurring operating items recorded by continuing operations decreased by €3 million, or 2.4%, from €125 million to €122 million. Depreciation and amortization rose by €10 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 as a result of capital expenditure incurred in previous years, whereas provisions were €5 million lower year on year, notably due to a decrease in provisions recorded for doubtful debts. 75 ----- _Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations_ Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations came to €176 million in the year ended September 30, 2019, compared to €175 million in the year ended September 30, 2018. The following table sets out adjusted EBITA by segment and as a percentage of the revenue of each segment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

This year-on-year stability in Adjusted EBITA margin was achieved thanks to an upturn in the second half, when the figure widened by 40 basis points compared with second-half of the year ended September 30, 2018. In the International segment, Adjusted EBITA totaled €90 million and represented 3.3% of revenue versus 3.4% in the year ended September 30, 2018. The positive effects of the measures carried out to improve margins were not enough to fully offset the adverse impact of (i) the termination of the contracts with the Ministry of Defense and reduced scope of the Tesco contracts in the United Kingdom, and (ii) the loss of the contract with the Alabama Department of Social Services in the United States. In France, Adjusted EBITA came to €109 million and represented 4.9% of revenue, up by 40 basis points compared with the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was driven by the contract catering strategy put in place in by the new management team, which notably resulted in a more selective approach to contracts and tighter operational discipline. Adjusted EBITA for the Corporate & Other segment declined in the year ended September 30, 2019 mostly due to IT opex incurred during the year. This segment includes the Adjusted EBITA contribution from city-site catering entities accounted for by the equity method. _Recurring operating profit from operations including share of profit from equity-accounted investees_ Recurring operating profit from continuing operations, including the share of profit of equityaccounted investees, came to €160 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 compared with €127 million in the year ended September 30, 2018. The year ended September 30, 2019 figure includes €21 million in amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions (compared to €19 million in the year ended September 30, 2018) and €5 million in income recorded under share-based compensation (compared with a €29 million expense in the year ended September 30, 2018). _Non-recurring income and expenses, net_ 76 ----- Non-recurring income and expenses, net, from continuing operations represented a net expense of €27 million in the year ended September 30, 2019 (compared to an €82 million net expense in the year ended September 30, 2018). For the year ended September 30, 2019, the item primarily included (i) €22 million in severance payments and other employee-related costs, and impairment losses recognized against operating assets, (ii) €4 million in impairment losses for internally-developed intangible assets, and (iii) reversals through profit of liabilities related to earn-out payments. The figure for the year ended September 30, 2018 primarily included (i) €64 million in impairment of goodwill related to contract catering operations (€46 million for Italy and €18 million for India), (ii) €19 million in severance payments and other employee-related costs, impairment losses recognized against operating assets and prototypes, and costs incurred by the Group's French and international operations for exiting contracts with start-ups, (iii) €3 million in acquisition and merger costs (mainly in the US), and (iv) reversals of liabilities related to earn-out payments and fair value adjustments on acquisitions carried out in the US and United Kingdom, recognized in profit because they were recorded after the 12-month measurement period. _Financial income and expenses, net_ Financial income and expenses for continuing operations represented a net expense of €69 million in the year ended September 30, 2019 compared with a net €68 million expense in the year ended September 30, 2018. The positive effect of the lower interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2019 due to the early repayment of the Group’s existing term loan facilities following the sale of Areas, as described in section 1.1 above, was offset by the accelerated amortization of the issuance costs related to this debt and the termination costs of the associated swaps. _Income tax_ The Group ended the year with an income tax benefit of €4 million in the year ended September 30, 2019 compared with a €2 million charge in the year ended September 30, 2018. Excluding the charge related to the French CVAE tax – which amounted to €21 million in both the year ended September 30, 2018 and the year ended September 30, 2019 – the Group’s income tax benefit came to €25 million in the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to €19 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The year-on-year improvement was principally due to a €20 million net tax benefit arising on the creation and use during the year of a short-term tax loss generated on the sale of Areas, whereas in the year ended September 30, 2018 a deferred tax benefit of €8 million was recorded following the US federal tax reforms. _Loss for the period from discontinued operations_ Net profit from discontinued operations amounted to €202 million for the year ended September 30, 2019, compared with €63 million the previous year. On July 1, 2019, the Group completed the sale of its Concession Catering business on which it recognized a €208 million net capital gain before final price adjustments. This amount corresponds to the sale price of €674 million, less (i) €462 million for the net amount of transferred assets and liabilities net of selling costs, and (ii) a €4 million translation reserve. In the year ended September 30, 2019, net profit for the period from discontinued operations also included the residual “City sites” activities operated by Restaurants et Sites and GSR – two entities that were not transferred to PAI. 77 ----- For the year ended September 30, 2018, net profit from discontinued operations primarily included the costs of liquidating an entity that previously formed part of the Group's Contract Catering business line (S.O.G.E.C.C.I.R). _Attributable profit for the period and earnings per share_ As a result of the factors described above, the Group’s attributable net profit for the year ended September 30, 2019 amounted to €271 million, versus €34 million in the year ended September 30, 2018. Basic and diluted earnings per share came to €1.54 and €1.53 respectively for the year ended September 30, 2019 compared with €0.19 (both basic and diluted EPS) in the year ended September 30, 2018. _Adjusted attributable profit for the period_ Adjusted attributable net profit for the period corresponds to net profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent adjusted for the following: (i) “Nonrecurring income and expenses, net”, (ii) goodwill impairment losses and net amortization of intangible assets recognized on consolidation in relation to acquisitions, (iii) exceptional impairment of investments in and loans to non-consolidated companies, (iv) the impact of the capital gains and losses on sales of consolidated companies recognized in “Net profit from discontinued operations”, with all of these adjustments being net of tax.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

We experience during the summer period a lower level of activity as a large number of employees and students are on vacation. The Group’s net working capital is also subject to seasonal fluctuations as the amount of trade receivables increases during the first half of each financial year as revenue invoiced to clients is at its peak during this period, and decreases during the second half which corresponds to the trough in activity in the Group’s contract catering business. As a result, cash used for changes in working capital during the first half of each financial year is material, as is cash generated from working capital during the second half of the financial year. In addition, the effect of seasonality on cash used for or generated from working capital generally increases from one year to another as consequence of the growth (whether organic or arising from acquisitions) in the Group’s consolidated annual revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

In addition, for certain lease contracts, on top of the fixed or guaranteed minimum lease payments due, the Group has committed to pay variable amounts that are not included when calculating lease liabilities. These variable amounts are generally based on footfall or revenue levels and cannot therefore be calculated for future periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Going forward, its ability to generate cash from its operating activities will depend on its future operating performance, which is, in turn, dependent to some extent on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the Group's control. The Group uses its cash and cash equivalents – which are denominated in euros and U.S. dollars – to fund the day-to-day requirements of its business. The Group's sources of liquidity have historically consisted mainly of the following: - Net cash from operating activities, which amounted to €50 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 versus €287 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. 78 ----- - Cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents recorded in the consolidated cash flow statement amounted to €42 million and €76 million at September 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively. - Debt, which includes our existing senior facilities agreement, the Receivables securitization program and finance lease liabilities.

This item represented a net cash inflow of €12 million in_ six months ended March 31, 2021, versus a €38 million net cash outflow for the comparable prior-year period. This year-on-year improvement was notably due to better collection of trade receivables and a higher amount of sales of trade receivables in France and Spain under the securitization program. _Interest and other financial expenses paid. The amount of interest paid was higher in the six_ months ended March 31, 2021 than in the six months ended March 31, 2020, reflecting the increase in the Group’s average consolidated debt. _Tax paid.

Other cash flows from operating activities mainly_ relate to (i) non- recurring income and expenses recorded under ""Non- recurring income and expenses, net"" in the consolidated income statement, and (ii) payments made in connection with fair value adjustments recognized in accordance with IFRS as part of the purchase price allocation process for acquisitions. This item represented net cash outflows of €4 million and €11 million for the six-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 respectively. The figures for both periods chiefly derived from restructuring costs. _Cash Flows from Investing Activities_ Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations totaled €30 million in the six months ended March 31, 2021 versus €58 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020. Capital expenditure (net operating investments).

For Contract Catering & Services, the figure came to €27 million for the six months ended March 31, 2021 and €51 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020, representing 1.4% and 2.1% of this business line's revenue respectively. The year-on-year decreases reflect the strict discipline the Group has exercised in terms of capital expenditure since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 80 ----- Purchases of and proceeds from sale of non-current financial assets. This item corresponded to a net cash outflow of €1 million in both of the six-month periods under review, and chiefly concerned guarantee deposits paid.

This item represented a nil amount in the six months ended March_ 31, 2021. In the six months ended March 30, 2020 they represented a net cash outflow of €21 million, arising from the share buyback program that was launched in 2019 and subsequently suspended. _Proceeds from borrowings. Consolidated cash inflows from proceeds from borrowings totaled_ €732 million and €231 million in the six-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 respectively. For the six months ended March 31, 2021, these proceeds chiefly corresponded to (i) a €225 million government- backed loan, and (ii) €6 million from new securitized receivables. In the six months ended March 31, 2021, these proceeds mainly corresponded to (i) drawdowns of the full amounts of euro- and US-dollar denominated revolving credit facilities totaling €450 million and €227 million respectively, and €55 million from new securitized receivables. _Repayments of borrowings. Repayments of borrowings led to net cash outflows of €3 million_ and €215 million in the six-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 respectively. The six months ended March 31, 2021 figure primarily corresponds to €201 million in repayments of euro-denominated revolving credit facilities and a €14 million decrease in securitized receivables.

The year-on-year decrease is chiefly attributable to the €192 million decline in EBITDA and the net €93 million negative swing in the cash flow from change in operating working capital compared to the year ended September 30, 2019. Change in operating working capital._ This item represented a net cash outflow of €9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 versus an €84 million net cash inflow one year earlier. The year-on-year negative swing was primarily due to the fall in business volumes which resulted in a €43 million decrease in outstanding amounts under the receivables securitization program. In addition, there was an unfavorable basis of comparison with the year ended September 30, 2019, when the change in operating working capital was positively impacted in an amount of €47 million by the fact that the CICE tax credit in France was replaced by a reduction in payroll taxes. Interest and other financial expenses paid._ The amount of interest paid fell from €54 million to €24 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to (i) the decrease in consolidated debt with the early repayment of the term loan following the sale of Areas in second-half of the year ended September 30, 2019, and (ii) lower interest rates. Tax paid._ Tax paid includes corporate income tax paid in all of the geographic regions in which the Group operates. It also includes the Italian IRAP tax (Imposta Regionale Sulle Attività _Produttive), the French CVAE tax and State Taxes in the United States._ This item represented net cash outflows of €11 million and €24 million in the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The year-on-year decrease was mainly attributable to (i) tax refunds received in 2020 (refunds of payments on account made in the year ended September 30, 2019) amounting to €5 million in France and €1 million in the United States, and (ii) the fact that the Group did not have to pay the BEAT tax in the United States for the year ended September 30, 2020. Other cash flows from operating activities._ Other cash flows from operating activities mainly relate to (i) non-recurring income and expenses recorded under ""Non-recurring income and expenses, net"" in the consolidated income statement, and (ii) payments made in connection with fair value adjustments recognized in accordance with IFRS as part of the purchase price allocation process for acquisitions.

Capital expenditure (net operating investments)._ Consolidated cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (capital expenditure), net of proceeds from sales, decreased year on year from €114 million to €89 million. For Contract Catering & Services, the figure came to €85 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, compared with €111 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. As a percentage of the business’s revenue this item decreased from 2.3% to 2.1%, reflecting the continued rigorous selection of capital expenditure projects.

This item corresponded_ to a net cash outflow of €3 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 and concerned deposits paid in the United States. For the year ended September 30, 2019, “Purchases of and proceeds from sale of non-current financial assets” represented a net cash inflow of €7 million and related to the sale of interests in a number of start-up companies purchased in prior periods. Acquisition/sale of shares in consolidated companies._ For the year ended September 30, 2020, acquisitions and sales of shares in consolidated companies represented a net cash outflow of €7 million, and primarily corresponded to earn-out payments relating to acquisitions in the United Kingdom and India carried out in prior periods. For the year ended September 30, 2019, this item represented a net cash outflow of €16 million, mainly corresponding to earn-out payments relating to acquisitions in the United States and India carried out in prior period. _Cash Flows from Financing Activities_ Cash flows from financing activities represented a net cash inflow of €70 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 versus a net cash outflow of €1,381 million in the year ended September 30, 2019. Movements in share capital of the parent._ In the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company repurchased €21 million worth of Elior Group shares, principally under the share buyback program launched in 2019.

Consolidated cash inflows from proceeds from borrowings totaled_ €936 million and €81 million in the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively. In both of the fiscal years under review these proceeds mainly corresponded to drawdowns on euro- and US dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities. Repayments of borrowings._ Repayments of borrowings led to cash outflows of €736 million and €1,379 million in the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The figure for the year ended September 30, 2020 principally corresponds to the repayment of amounts used under revolving facilities. In the year ended September 30, 2019, this item primarily concerned (i) the repayment in advance (with no early repayment penalties) of €654 million and $344 million of the Group's term loan facilities, and $100 million in bond debt, and (ii) the repayment of amounts drawn down on revolving facilities. _Effect of exchange rate and other changes.

This item_ represented a €55 million net cash outflow in the year ended September 30, 2020 versus a net inflow of €1,224 million one year earlier. The figure for the year ended September 30, 2020 includes the impact of a €48 million purchase price adjustment paid to PAI Partners in relation to the sale of Areas.

The year-on-year increase is chiefly attributable to the rise in EBITDA and the fact that the cash inflow from change in operating working capital was €81 million higher than in the year ended September 30, 2018. Change in operating working capital._ This item improved in the year ended September 30, 2019, representing a net cash inflow of €84 million against €3 million for the previous fiscal year. The year-on-year increase chiefly reflects better management of operating working capital in the Contract Catering business and a €48 million positive impact resulting from the CICE tax credit in France being replaced by a reduction in payroll taxes. Interest and other financial expenses paid._ The amount of interest paid was slightly higher than in the year ended September 30, 2018, reflecting the increase in average consolidated debt in the first half of the year ending September 30, 2019, although this negative effect was partly offset in the second half following the debt repayments carried out during that period. _Tax paid. Tax paid includes corporate income tax paid in all of the geographic regions in which_ the Group operates. It also includes the Italian IRAP tax (Imposta Regionale Sulle Attività Produttive), the French CVAE tax and State Tax in the United States. This item represented a net cash outflow of €24 million in the year ended September 30, 2019, versus €21 million in the year ended September 30, 2018.

Consolidated cash inflows from proceeds from borrowings totaled_ €216 million and €81 million in the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2019 respectively. In both of the fiscal years under review these proceeds mainly corresponded to drawdowns on euro- and US dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities. _Repayments of borrowings.

As a second wave of lockdowns hit Europe in October, we saw that COVID-19 will continue to create persistent uncertainty in the coming months. The recovery in economic activity is expected to be gradual and bumpy throughout the year ending September 30, 2021, and at varying rates depending on how the pandemic plays out in the countries where Elior operates. Based on all known variables at this point, the assumptions for the year ending September 30, 2021 that Elior is using to plan and make its decisions are as follows: Business & Industry market will depend on vaccination campaigns, which will dictate when public health restrictions are relaxed. Relaxed restrictions will determine the extent to which our volumes rebound. It is a seasonal market, so we are unlikely to see a material recovery before September. The Education market, in France, will be affected by stricter health protocols imposed in late March. The current health protocols have led to volumes dropping without warning, which 87 ----- makes adjusting costs difficult. In the US, depending on the school district, back-to-school is expected to resume earlier than usual, while some schools may continue to use a hybrid model of in-person and online learning. The Health & Welfare market should remain relative stable through the second half. The postponement of elective surgery, closure of hospital cafeterias, and slow recovery in nursing home occupancy rates will remain a drag on our volumes. Our services business in France is expected to remain on the right track, notably thanks to an adapted offering well-suited to health and safety requirements. Wherever possible, we will continue to use the available government furlough and business support programs and will further adapt our cost structure to protect our profitability. Cost discipline, tight cash management and reinforced selling, general and administrative cost discipline will also continue in full force, alongside the restructuring measures already undertaken. Considering the timelines announced for an easing of restrictions and our businesses’ inherent seasonality, our performance in the second half will depend mainly on whether the conditions are in place for a recovery in September. 88 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.47,INDUSTRY Overview,17.47.1,,"We are a leading international player in contract catering & services, serving 4 million customers every day at approximately 22,700 restaurants and points of sale across the world, and looking after 2,300 sites for clients in France through our services offerings. We have over 105,000 employees based in six main countries in Europe and North America, and a small presence in Asia. Our mission is to be a responsible caterer and facility management provider aiming for sustainable growth. Our contract catering business serves three key client markets: corporate entities and government agencies (Business & Industry), educational establishments (Education), and health and welfare establishments (Health & Welfare). We operate our contract catering activities in our traditional markets of France, Spain (including Portugal), Italy and the United Kingdom as well as in the United States since 2013. In every contract catering market we serve, we seek to tailor our services to meet each client and guest profile. In the Business & Industry market, our business model has historically been focused on providing outsourced contract catering services at our customers’ premises, where we prepare and serve meals at corporate sites (SMEs, blue chip), government offices, museums, stadiums and on board trains. In accordance with the size and requirements of the business, we deploy new operating models such as leveraging on our central production units (central kitchen) that we already used mainly in the education market as well as innovations and digital solutions to facilitate meal delivery. For example, we have developed applications for pre-ordering and paying for meals, which reduce wait times during peak periods. Another example of innovation is Food360, which allows an employee to order food on an application and receive the quality and balanced dish in the workplace smart refrigerator at the time desired. In the Education market, we operate the largest kitchen infrastructure in Europe, which allows us to combine high productivity with a local presence. We use local and certified organic food in our homemade recipes to promote healthy eating habits among our young guests. We provide catering and services for both public and private education from early childhood, day-care, school (elementary and higher), through to university. In the Health & Welfare market, we provide catering and services for hospitals, clinics, retirement homes and day-care centers for disabled, elderly and dependent (including home delivery). We tailor catering solutions to patients’ pathologies, adapting textures and personalizing nutritional protocols. Based on revenue generated in the year ended September 30, 2020, we estimate that we are the second-largest pure player in contract catering & services worldwide, with leading market positions in Europe and a growing presence in the United States. The majority of our services business is conducted in France and involves the provision of soft facility management solutions, notably cleaning, reception, concierge, light maintenance and grounds maintenance services. Through this business, we provide public and private-sector institutional clients with a wide array of outsourced solutions ranging from cleaning and reception services through to the management of offices, hotels, shopping malls, leisure and vacation parks and office and apartment buildings. We estimate that we are the sixth-leading cleaning services provider in France and the number one provider of outsourced cleaning and hospitality services for the French healthcare sector. In the year ended September 30, 2020, we generated total consolidated revenue of €3,967 million, of which €1,778 million was generated in France and €2,182 million internationally, with €1,620 million from the Business & Industry market, €1,149 million from the Education market and €1,198 million from the Health & Welfare market. Our largest market by revenue is France, followed by the US. 89 ----- In the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated total consolidated revenue of €4,923 million, of which €2,212 million was generated in France and €2,689 million internationally, with €2,256 million from the Business & Industry market, €1,415 million from the Education market and €1,252 million from the Health & Welfare market. In the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations of €176 million of which €109 million in France and €90 million internationally.

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.48,Contract Catering market,17.48.1,COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of a contagious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (or SARS-CoV-2) (“COVID-19”). As of May 19, 2021, more than 164 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.4 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression. Authorities worldwide have responded globally to contain the spread of the disease by implementing international and regional travel bans, lockdowns, quarantines and business closures which impacts the number of meals served across the countries and sectors where we are present, in particular in our Business & Industry market due to office closures and the increase in homeworking in white collars sites, and in Education due to school closures and home schooling. Healthcare is impacted to a lesser extent and mainly relates to low cafeterias attendance due to restrictions 90 ----- imposed in Hospitals as a result of strict social distancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Many establishments began reopening as restrictions eased across the countries where we operate but with a significant decrease in office and production facility attendance and to a lesser extent lower attendance across schools and universities. In addition, restrictions are still in place resulting in fewer catering events, lower cultural attraction attendance and limited travel all impacting the number of meals served. We believe the pace of recovery will vary depending on the sector and geography. For instance a slower recovery in expected in the Business & Industry market especially for white collars sites due to the continued government imposed restrictions on office occupancy rates and for the trains on board catering segment due to the reduction of business travelers. Meanwhile blue collar is expected to recover at a more progressive pace. In the US, a moderate recovery is expected for the catering events and cultural attractions while social distance measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus will remain in place in the Corrections segment impacting the pace of recovery. In Education in both Europe and the US we expect a rapid recovery for nurseries, primary and secondary schools and slow recovery in higher education. In Health & Welfare, in Europe and the US we expect a fast recovery in short stay for patient feeding in both private & public sectors, in addition to senior home recovery and but a more moderate pace of recovery in cafeterias due to the social distance measure put in place. The impact of the crisis has led to an acceleration in the long-term trends we have observed across our markets over the past few years changing eating habits, consumers’ high expectations in terms of food quality and nutrition and an increasing focus on food safety, hygiene and traceability. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened demand for more flexible, grab & go and digitally enabled catering solutions and offers that are compatible with COVID19 health and safety guidelines to prevent dining areas from becoming too busy, in addition to creating new offerings to respond to their new consumption patterns. The current health crisis has also increased consumers attention to sustainability with a focus on local sourcing, the fight against food waste and the role of caterers in the community. Overall contracting catering operators are adjusting their business models and offerings to adapt to the changing market. In most countries the market is structured around four main corporate profiles: international groups, like Elior; large companies with national coverage; regional local players; and players specialized in a particular segment. It is a market in which guests’ expectations change in line with trends in society. The current health crisis has accelerated this underlying movement, with consumers paying increasing attention to sustainability (local sourcing, the fight against food waste, the role of caterers in the community, etc.), nutritional balance and transparency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.48,Contract Catering market,17.48.2,Business & Industry,"Clients in the Business & Industry market for contract catering consist mainly of employers in both the public and private sector seeking to outsource food services for their employees. Our clients belong to various sectors, from manufacturing to financial services, and are of all sizes, from SMEs to international corporations. The Business & Industry market also includes clients in the defense (armed forces) and correctional sectors (penitentiaries), transport such as onboard rail catering (Trenitalia) and sit-down dining and snack options to enjoy at leisure venues such as stadiums (Murrayfield), zoos, museums and prestigious cultural sites (the Vatican). In the European countries in which we operate, we estimate that the size of the Business & Industry market represents a potential of approximately €12 billion as of 2019. We estimate that the outsourcing rate is 78% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market 91 ----- is approximately €10 billion representing approximately 46% of the aggregate outsourced catering market in the European countries in which we operate. Additionally, we estimate that the Business & Industry market in the US segments where we operate represents a potential of approximately €18 billion as of 2019 of which 65% is currently outsourced implying a market size of €12 billion. Traditionally, the business model used in the Business & Industry market tends to be tailored to the specific needs of a client and catering concepts range from full-service dining rooms to self-service cafeterias and fast food and snack areas. Caterers provide meals that are for the most part prepared directly on-site by their own staff in kitchen areas that are made available by clients. The Business & Industry market operates on the basis of a business-to-business model, where the direct client of the caterer is the company or private or public institution that owns or leases from third parties the space in which catering services are to be provided. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to be a catalyst for certain long-term changes to the traditional business model in the Business & Industry market. The reorganization of work spaces and ways of working will have a lasting impact on consumption patterns. In the private sector, high-street brand and grab and go concepts, which were already popular before the crisis has been a faster pace of development of new services based on faster penetration of digital technology (click & collect and take-away solutions, etc.), enabling catering services to cover wider areas and broader timeslots. We expect an increasing trend towards working from home and overall lower office attendance especially in white collar sites where flexible working between home and office is expected to become the norm. As the catering requirements of our clients adjust to lower a number of required meals the classic on-site production model is expected to evolve depending on the size of the site. As a result we have developed and launched new asset-light solutions with connected fridges and delivery of remotely produced food to more profitability address the lower end of the market of 150 to 250 meals per day while for larger sites on-site production is expected to remain the main model. For the larger sites we expect the on-site production model to co-exist with a delivery model to address lower office footfall for certain days of the week as we expect the number of consumers pre-ordering for multiple-days to be taken either taken from the office or delivered at home to increase. We are well positioned to respond to the changing dynamics within our Business & Industry market with the ability to leverage off our extensive central kitchen model, our modified atmospheric packaging knowhow enabling longer shelf life and delivery capacities including the recent acquisition of Nestor in France to capture the increasingly relevant small and medium-sized addressable market. Since the first lockdown we have accelerated the repositioning of our offer towards an asset-light model (connected fridges), combining digitally enabled services (ordering, click & collect) and a culinary offer revised for larger sites to keep up with consumer trends focused on health and nutritional transparency to compensate the decrease of employees onsite with an improved capture rate. Business & Industry contracts with private entities are generally for a fixed term, though generally speaking contract duration varies according to negotiation. If however significant capital expenditures are required from the caterers, contracts tend to have a fixed term of three to five years. Contracts with public entities also tend to be of a three- to five-year duration. However, in situations where significant capital expenditures are necessary, caterers typically will negotiate a clause that will indemnify the caterer for the unamortized value of any capital expenditures at the time of a contract termination by a client. Contracts in the Business & Industry market can be priced based on a profit and loss model, a cost-plus model or a hybrid of the two. For profit and loss contracts, pricing is determined in advance on a per meal basis that is periodically adjustable based on a pre-agreed pricing index for food, staff and services. Caterers are typically protected against losses resulting from under-attendance by a fee structure that is variable based on attendance levels. For cost-plus contracts, clients pay a fixed management fee in addition to the actual costs of raw materials and other overhead. 92 ----- Generally, clients are invoiced based on the difference between the amounts paid by a guest at the catering site and the contract price.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.48,Contract Catering market,17.48.3,Education,"The Education market comprises three main segments (pre-school; elementary, middle and high schools; and higher education) and our clients in this market include both state-run and private establishments. Our historic clients in the Education market are local authorities, which for a long time have outsourced their catering to organizations that can guarantee a high level of food safety and constant production volumes, with the necessary logistics capabilities. Educational institutions vary in size and resources and therefore in their food service needs. Smaller sites, typically public primary schools, generally require meals that are prepared offsite and are delivered to the school for final preparation. Larger institutions, such as private schools, public secondary schools and universities, tend to have sufficient space for kitchens where food can be prepared or for other dining facilities such as fast food areas or snack bars. In the European countries in which we operate, we estimate that the size of the Education market represents a potential of approximately €14 billion as of 2019. We estimate that the outsourcing rate is 42% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market is approximately €6 billion representing approximately 48% of the aggregate outsourced catering market in the European countries in which we operate. Additionally, we estimate that the Education market in the US segments we operate in represents a potential of approximately €36 billion as of 2019 of which 34% is currently outsourced implying an outsourced catering market size of €12 billion. We believe that the Education market represents strong growth potential in particular for secondary schools and universities, with outsourcing rates still relatively low in both in Europe and US. We expect to see a further acceleration in outsourcing in both Europe & the US as a result of the pandemic driven by public funding constraints (and the necessity to save costs) and adapting new food service solutions to COVID-19 lessons (with an increased focus on digital & mobile solutions, wellness and nutrition). We expect that activity will quickly resume to precovid levels with limited changes and no anticipated volume decrease. In higher education food delivery platforms have significantly increased their activity and it is expected that delivery remain at a higher level than pre-covid along with the increase use of mobility & digital services. The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted the social role of food service at schools and distribution of meals has continued in several countries (Spain, US, UK) even during lockdown and we expect that more attention to food will be given by families & public authorities leading to increasing demand for healthiness, transparency and menu personalization and the roll out of specific regulations such as the free lunch program in the UK. In higher education food delivery platforms have significantly increased their activity and it is expected that delivery remain at a higher level than pre-covid along with the increase use of mobility & digital services. Traditionally, the Education market has differentiated itself from other markets in the contract catering industry due to the extensive use of central kitchens. In order to serve clients with limited on-site space for meal preparation, contract caterers have been given the opportunity to operate off-site central kitchens, from which large quantities of meals are prepared and delivered warm directly to several sites or kept chilled (or frozen) for delivery and consumption at a later date. Central kitchens operated by contract caterers are either built by public entities themselves to supply public schools within one or a group of municipalities and are operated under contract by a private contact caterer, or are alternatively owned or leased from third parties. The contract caterer is responsible for staffing the kitchen and for supplying cookware and utensils. The Education market generally requires a higher level of capital expenditures when the central kitchen is owned by the caterer, because large cooking equipment, such as 93 ----- ovens and refrigerators, as well as packaging equipment need to be purchased and maintained by the caterer along with crockery and utensils. The terms of the contracts in the Education market vary based on the nature of the institution and on the country. Contracts with private entities tend to have an indefinite term, although contracts requiring significant capital expenditures generally have fixed durations of three to five years. Contracts with public entities tend to have a finite term, ranging from one year to up to 15 years depending on the nature of services provided and the level of capital expenditures required. In France in particular, contracts for the operation of a publicly owned central kitchen are viewed as a delegation of public service (délégation de service public) and are subject to special regulations. Typically, a fixed price is set per meal served that may be adjusted according to attendance, and clients are invoiced on a monthly basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.48,Contract Catering market,17.48.4,Health & Welfare,"Clients in the Health & Welfare market for contract catering include public and private healthcare and elder care facilities, including clinics, hospitals, rehabilitation centers and facilities for the care of the elderly and the disabled. Meals may either be prepared on-site by contract caterers or prepared off-site at central kitchens (although the use of central kitchens is less significant than in the Education market) or by third parties. Due to the nature of the setting and the needs of the patients, services provided to the Health & Welfare market tend to include other support services for healthcare facilities. For example, many contract caterers not only prepare meals on-site, but also arrange for the delivery of meals directly to patients in their rooms. Caterers also tailor meals to fit specific dietary guidelines and nutritional concerns for the ill or elderly. Contract terms in the Healthcare market generally resemble those in the Education market. Pricing is determined on a per meal or per day basis and clients are invoiced on a monthly basis. In the European countries in which we operate, we estimate that the size of the Health & Welfare market represents a potential of approximately €17 billion as of 2019. We estimate that the outsourcing rate is 33% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market is approximately €5 billion representing approximately 26% of the aggregate outsourced catering market in the European countries in which we operate. Additionally, we estimate that the Health & Welfare market in the US segments we operate in represents a potential of approximately €27 billion as of 2019 of which 30% is currently outsourced implying an outsourced catering market size of €8 billion. We believe that the Health & Welfare market represents strong growth potential notably in France and the United States, due to general population aging, the market's still relatively low outsourcing rates, and the further development of value-added sub-segments, such as home meal deliveries, hospital after-care services, and new services related to an expected trend towards higher-end offerings in elder care facilities. Following the COVID-19 pandemic we expect that activity and operations will remain fairly similar to pre-COVID-19 in the short stay segments. The development of ambulatory services could however lead to a reduction of nights in the short stay segment which will limit growth prospects in hospitals and clinics and lead to a change of operating models moving from onsite to central production units. In long stay and senior care homes we expect new models of facilities to emerge partly through public funded programs following the trauma of COVID-19 which is expected to create new opportunities for an acceleration of outsourcing. Demand for meals delivered at home for seniors have slowed-down during COVID-19 but is expected to accelerate due to demographics and the necessity to delay entry in care homes for elderlies with no major health issue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Health & Welfare is the market that offers the most opportunities for leveraging synergies between catering and services. In the Services business, an outsourcer’s offering often comprises many high added-value services, including specialized cleaning and a wide range of hospitality services such as concierge services, preand post-hospitalization support. We estimate that the French cleaning services market generated over €25 billion in revenue in 2017, around €12 billion of which derived from the outsourced segment of the market, representing an outsourcing rate of approximately 48%. We also estimate that sales generated by the outsourced cleaning services market in France are still growing at an annual rate of between 2% and 3%. On the basis of research carried out by external agencies, we consider that specialized cleaning services represented 40% of the overall revenue generated by the cleaning services market in France in 2016, versus 60% for standard and office cleaning services. We believe that the French cleaning services market is highly fragmented, with around 45,000 companies referenced. Players generating less than €100 million in revenue together account for almost 65% of the market's total revenue. Our Services business faces competition from large, multinational providers such as Sodexo and ISS, as well as from smaller, regionallybased service providers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

We estimate that the outsourcing rate is 43% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market is €53 billion. We believe that the market for outsourced contract catering has maintained steady growth. In Europe we estimate that the outsourcing rate is 49% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market is €21 billion while in the U.S. we estimate that the outsourcing rate is 40% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market is €32 billion. Historically, the growth of a given segment depends on (i) changes in the number of meals served, (ii) inflation and changes in per-meal prices and (iii) changes in outsourcing rates, i.e. the proportion of clients who outsource their catering services rather than managing them inhouse. We expect outsourcing levels to increase in some Education and Health & Welfare market segments where the in-house management model still dominates in several countries. We expect the outsourced catering market to continue to grow globally, with different growth rates for the various market segments as some segments will be more affected than others by the COVID-19 pandemic. The contract catering market is characterized as a local market with a fairly limited number of multi-country invitations to tender as these do not generate operational synergies. It is a specific market, with invitations to tender for catering services rarely combined with other types of services, particularly in Continental Europe, the main exception being in the health & welfare sector. Before the COVID-19 crisis it was a market that had low barriers to entry, apart from in the state education sector, where operators in most countries need to invest in central kitchens. The impact of the crisis on the Business & Industry market has led the Group to speed up its transformation process and the diversification of its offerings.

At the same time, large players such as Elior are better equipped to compete for major contracts. The COVID-19 pandemic has created some opportunities for new entrants particularly in the Business & Industry market with the emergence of start-ups from the foodtech sector proposing asset-light models (connected fridges), remote food production and digitally enabled service delivery. The success of delivery platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats has mainly occurred in the B2C space and we do not expect they will have a major impact on the core B2B space. We believe that a number of smaller-sized players may struggle financially following the impact of the pandemic and have limited investment capacity to transform and adapt to the postCOVID-19 environment.

The relatively low outsourcing rates in the Education and Health & Welfare markets and in the US generally are expected to support addressable market growth in the coming years, as further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Health & Welfare market, growth will also be underpinned by demographics and an ageing population, the development of value-added sub-segments, such as home meal deliveries, hospital aftercare services, and new services related to an expected trend towards higher-end offerings in elder care facilities. In education, institutions will need to adapt to COVID-19 lessons with an increased focus on digital and mobile solutions as well as wellness, nutrition and vegetarian recipes. 97 ----- We believe that as companies and other private institutions seek to maximize savings during the current uncertain economic environment and as public entities continue to operate under political pressure to reduce spending, they will focus on their core business and competencies, which do not include providing food services to their workforces, students, residents or patients.

We have over 105,000 employees based in six main countries in Europe and North America, and a small presence in Asia. Our mission is to be a responsible caterer and facility management provider aiming for sustainable growth. Our contract catering business serves three key client markets: corporate entities and government agencies (Business & Industry), educational establishments (Education), and health and welfare establishments (Health & Welfare). We operate our contract catering activities in our traditional markets of France, Spain (including Portugal), Italy and the United Kingdom as well as in the United States since 2013. In every contract catering market we serve, we seek to tailor our services to meet each client and guest profile. In the Business & Industry market, our business model has historically been focused on providing outsourced contract catering services at our customers’ premises, where we prepare and serve meals at corporate sites (SMEs, blue chip), government offices, museums, stadiums and on board trains. In accordance with the size and requirements of the business, we deploy new operating models such as leveraging on our central production units (central kitchen) that we already used mainly in the education market as well as innovations and digital solutions to facilitate meal delivery. For example, we have developed applications for pre-ordering and paying for meals, which reduce wait times during peak periods. Another example of innovation is Food360, which allows an employee to order food on an application and receive the quality and balanced dish in the workplace smart refrigerator at the time desired. In the Education market, we operate the largest kitchen infrastructure in Europe, which allows us to combine high productivity with a local presence. We use local and certified organic food in our homemade recipes to promote healthy eating habits among our young guests. We provide catering and services for both public and private education from early childhood, day-care, school (elementary and higher), through to university. In the Health & Welfare market, we provide catering and services for hospitals, clinics, retirement homes and day-care centers for disabled, elderly and dependent (including home delivery). We tailor catering solutions to patients’ pathologies, adapting textures and personalizing nutritional protocols. Based on revenue generated in the year ended September 30, 2020, we estimate that we are the second-largest pure player in contract catering & services worldwide, with leading market positions in Europe and a growing presence in the United States. The majority of our services business is conducted in France and involves the provision of soft facility management solutions, notably cleaning, reception, concierge, light maintenance and grounds maintenance services. Through this business, we provide public and private-sector institutional clients with a wide array of outsourced solutions ranging from cleaning and reception services through to the management of offices, hotels, shopping malls, leisure and vacation parks and office and apartment buildings. We estimate that we are the sixth-leading cleaning services provider in France and the number one provider of outsourced cleaning and hospitality services for the French healthcare sector. In the year ended September 30, 2020, we generated total consolidated revenue of €3,967 million, of which €1,778 million was generated in France and €2,182 million internationally, with €1,620 million from the Business & Industry market, €1,149 million from the Education market and €1,198 million from the Health & Welfare market.

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.53,Our Competitive Strengths,17.53.1,,"Our business benefits from a number of competitive strengths, including: _Operating in large and stable markets with attractive fundamentals_ Our key markets of France, Spain and Italy where we enjoy strong, defendable positions and longstanding relationships with clients are historically among the largest and most stable markets for contract catering with high levels of outsourcing. In addition, we operate in the United Kingdom and United States which are displaying stronger growth and higher tendencies towards outsourcing of contract catering. We estimate the markets in which we operate for contract catering represented €124 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and we estimate that the outsourcing rate is 43% which implies that the size of our outsourced catering market, or addressable market, is €53 billion. Outsourcing in the United States in the Health & Welfare market and Education market remains low – and offers significant promise for future business. Disruptions from new work practices in the Business & Industry market limits short term visibility on recovery prospects. However, the disruptions are expected to be offset in the med-term by adapting contract catering offerings. Key secular growth drivers that will provide our platform with new revenue streams and enhanced add-on options to boost margins include (i) outsourcing of contract catering as clients focus on their core business, (ii) concerns regarding food safety, hygiene, and traceability and (iii) an increasing focus on healthy, balanced, and high quality meals. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an acceleration in the longterm trends we have observed across our markets over the past few years and heightened demand for more flexible, grab & go and digitally enabled catering solutions and offers that are compatible with COVID-19 health and safety guidelines to prevent dining areas from becoming too busy, in addition to creating new offerings to respond to new consumption patterns such as working from home. Overall contracting catering operators are adjusting their business models and offerings to adapt to the changing market dynamics which will continue to drive growth opportunities in our contract catering market. We steadfastly focus on these growth drivers through our business. Firstly, we are well positioned to respond to the disruption in our Business & Industry market with the ability to leverage off our extensive central kitchen model and benefit from our modified atmospheric packaging knowhow enabling longer shelf life and delivery capacities including the recent acquisition of Nestor in France to help capture the increasingly relevant small and mediumsized addressable market. Since the first lockdown we have accelerated the repositioning of our offer towards an asset-light model (connected fridges), combining digitally enabled services (ordering, click & collect) and a culinary offer revised for larger sites to keep up with consumer trends focused on healthy, balanced and high quality meals and nutritional transparency. Secondly, in the Education market, we are responding to the increasing focus on nutrition. For example, in September 2020 we introduced the Nutri-Score food rating system in our school canteens in France, making us the first – and only – contract caterer to have done so, and with our Safe Café concepts we deliver high health & safety standards, increasing customer confidence and capture rate. Thirdly, in Health & Welfare, we have 100 ----- developed ultra-personalized catering solutions by expanding our home delivery services and by rolling out senior-specific offerings such as Nutri-Age in Italy and Idequatio in France, focused on addressing the individual needs of our guests based on their nutritional requirements and capabilities. We are present in the markets and sectors that display high growth potential. The table below shows the outsourced addressable market in France, the United States, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. _Leading player in the contract catering sector with scale positions in its key markets_ We are a leading contract catering player in France, Italy, and Spain with strong market positions in the United Kingdom and United States, covering addressable markets of approximately €53 billion. The contract catering market is characterized by a large number of small and mid-size regional or specialized operators competing with a few national or international players. In our markets, critical mass is an essential competitive factor, as it creates the ability to offer prices that match market expectations. We are well-positioned as a market leader, and we estimate we occupy the #1 position in France, #1 in Spain, #1 in Italy, #4 in the United Kingdom and #5 in the United States, a market which offers attractive opportunities to further grow our footprint. We seek to partner with our clients, and we distinguish our value proposition through the size of our offering, our ability to exploit economies of scale both in procurement (a key cost item permitting us to deliver contracts more competitively) but also in innovation. Our leadership is based on competitive pricing solutions, a more diverse and healthier offering range, and more efficient safety and hygiene regulation compliance. Our differentiated features attract a large and diversified customer base. Another pillar of our business model is our portfolio of brands which we operate including Elior, Serunion, Hospes and Corporate Chefs, both in France and internationally, which have built up a reputation for quality and excellence in their reference markets. As a result of our strong market position, we have been able to pursue targeted growth opportunities while also focusing on winning larger contracts that offer broader options for geography and services. 101 ----- _Resilience thanks to a diversified business mix, loyal client base and multi-year contracts_ We operate a resilient business model, underpinned by a diverse business mix, loyal client base, and multi-year contracts. The strength of our business is mainly due to the wide diversity of our operations, in terms of both business sectors and geographies. Our diversified business mix makes us uniquely positioned in contract catering during the pandemic because of the limited exposure to the disrupted white collars segment in our Business & Industry market (only represented 18% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019) and limited exposure to higher education in our Education market (only represented 3% of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019). The table below shows the revenue for 2019 breakdown by market. Our business mix is strengthened by our expansion globally. We have a growing international presence since 2014 and now operate in six countries. For the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated 45% of our revenue in France and 55% internationally, as compared to 56% in France and 44% internationally for the year ended September 30, 2014. After entering into the largest and fastest growing US market in 2013, we are the number five player today. The graphic below shows our revenue breakdown by geography for 2019 as compared to 2014. 102 ----- Furthermore, our business model is strengthened by the fact that we have a wide and diverse client portfolio. Our loyal and diversified customer base includes more than 14,000 contracts. Our retention rate in contract catering, for the year ended September 30, 2020, was 91.8%. We pride ourselves with building long-standing relationships with our clients, and we have been working with our top five clients for more than twenty years on average. Nonetheless, our revenues are diversified and we have avoided dependence on any single client, which provides our platform with the stability and strength to navigate changing market conditions. For the year ended September 30, 2019, our five largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 7% of total revenue for the contract catering segment, our ten largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 9% of total revenue for the contract catering segment, our fifteen largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue for the contract catering segment, and our twenty largest contract catering clients accounted for approximately 13% of total revenue for the contract catering segment. Our 30-year track record of providing outsourced contract catering solutions to a variety of markets for operators both large and small has permitted us to accumulate expertise which we deploy to tailor offerings matching customers’ specific needs with varying contractual features that promotes client stickiness and retention. Some of our selected clients include Trenitalia, SEAT, the City of Lyon, London Business School and Savannah State University. In addition, we offer favorable contract features. Our long term contracts have on average a five year duration. We maintain a balanced portfolio between public sector and non-public sector clients, with approximately 64% of our revenue generated by non-public clients and the remaining 36% generated by public clients. Moreover, automatic extension clauses and indexation based on prices of raw materials and labor costs contained in many of our contracts protect our margins. The loyalty from our clients is premised on superior service delivery as well as close collaboration together to drive bespoke solutions. More recently, our management deployed fast responses to COVID-19 with critical solutions tailored to specific needs – for example, keeping school cafeterias open to provide nutrition to children and maintaining services at factories, hospitals and other mission critical facilities. We adapted our contracts in line with attendance throughout the pandemic, which allowed us to seize the opportunity to improve contractual terms through targeted renegotiations based on local conditions. _Consistent financial performance_ At Elior Group, we maintain a sharp focus on financial performance metrics. We have demonstrated our ability to consistently grow our revenue over the years both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions, recording a consolidated compounded annual revenue growth 103 ----- rate of approximately 5.8% (of which 1.6% is organic) between the years ended September 30, 2013 and 2019. Additionally, we have maintained resilient EBITDA margins with the potential to further improve profitability. For the years ended September 30, 2018, 2019, and 2020, our EBITDA margins were respectively 5.5%, 6.2% and 1.3% (pre-IFRS 16) (which would have been 6.4% as adjusted to normalize for the COVID-19 impact). Our revenue and EBITDA growth has been supported by our selective acquisition strategy and by our ability to generate continued organic growth despite difficult economic conditions. Our Cash Conversion rates (defined as EBITDA minus net capital expenditures divided by EBITDA) for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2019, and 2020 were respectively 40%, 62% and would have been 66% as adjusted to normalize for the COVID-19 impact. Our management keeps a sharp focus on strong free cash flow generation and pursues only EBITDA accretive acquisitions and capital expenditure initiatives that promise to capture new revenue streams. We believe that as a result of the foregoing, our efficient business model is characterized by good profitability levels, low working capital requirements, and stringent capital expenditure resulting in strong cash flow generation. _Well placed to benefit from supportive macro trends and return to normal_ Our business is resilient and poised to rebound as the stringent lockdown and social distancing measures imposed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are eased and as the rate of vaccination continues to increase in our geographies. Elior is well placed to benefit from macro trends which support the contract catering business generally and in particular provide further opportunities for revenue and margin growth based on our diversified platform, as proven in France between April 2020 and September 2020. Certain aspects of our business were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as offices and workplaces closed or reduced the number of employees present per day, particularly in France in the Business & Industry and Education markets, with number of meals served decreasing in the year ended September 30, 2020 to approximately 7% and 10% of year ended September 30, 2019 levels. The Health & Welfare market remained fairly resilient as a result of our support to hospitals, clinics and frontline workers who may have had an increased propensity to eat at on-site locations when alternatives were closed, even though COVID-19 impacted the number of visitors in cafeterias, reduced capacity in hospitals, and reduced capacity in senior homes where new guests were temporarily not accepted. As lockdown measures began to be progressively lifted in May 2020, we experienced a significant pick-up in the French Education market with meal count recovering to 95% of 2019 levels by September 2020. Recovery in the Business & Industry market was more gradual with an increased proportion of companies’ workforce adjusting to new norms. Due to our business mix and the sustained focus by management in all of our markets to safely reopen sites when national legislation permitted us to do so, we have been among the most resilient players in the industry as compared to our listed company peers when 2020 organic sales are measured against 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the geographies and markets where we operate were affected in different ways. For example in France, the number of meals served sharply declined in April to June 2020 during the first lockdown but then continued to recover as restrictions eased, peaking at 86% in the month of September, 2020 compared to 2019 levels. Since fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we have recorded a more stable reduction in meal count and revenue compared to 2019. Recovery trends have varied across end-markets in the second quarter of 2021 with Education and Health & Welfare proving more resilient (Education meals served was at 92% compared to 2019; Health & Welfare meals served was at 87% compared to 2019; whereas Business and Industry meals served was at 44% compared to 2019). Our international business units are recovering at different paces on a country-by-country basis because of differing lockdown and social distancing easing measures and vaccination rates. Meal volumes in the US remained more resilient during the pandemic (around 85-90% compared to 2019 on average), supported by softer restrictions and good performance in Education (particularly K-12) and Health & Welfare. Recovery 104 ----- patterns in Europe followed similar trends to France. Italy’s resilience was supported by favorable Business & Industry exposure to industrials, while meals served in the United Kingdom struggled due to stricter lockdown measures. In terms of revenue, international activity levels dropped to 57% over the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower European volumes. Since the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue recovered to around 70% compared to 2019. In the short term, more favorable conditions are expected in the United States and the United Kingdom as vaccination rollouts advance. Throughout the pandemic, our decentralized and nimble management structure displayed its ability to pivot in accordance with local conditions and client needs. Management focused on structural cost optimization through contract renegotiation and labor savings to put us in a position of recovery from COVID-19. Contracts were successfully renegotiated for lockdowns and re-openings. These renegotiations included price revision clauses and menu reengineering along with flexible combination of production and service operating model (switching from on-site to central production) as well as contract extension to secure future revenues. We also adjusted field operations and organizational structures to activity levels. As a result, we believe we are well positioned post-pandemic with utilization of government supported furlough and technical unemployment programs. Elior’s restructuring plans include €103 million already provisioned in the year ended September 30, 2020, notably €68 million in France following the Group’s job redeployment plan involving an 1,888 FTEs workforce reduction. We expect that these restructuring initiatives will lead to a short term cash outflow with an approximately one-year payback period. Furthermore, management seized the initiative to opportunistically renegotiate key cost items, such as service contacts (linen, maintenance, insurance and vehicle fleet) and optimize site locations. Recognizing that meal volumes are dependent upon restriction measures taken to curtail the latest pandemic waves, management has concentrated on proactively reducing our cost base. During the first half of 2021, we operated close to EBITA breakeven and initiatives to maintain capital expenditures under control (approximately 1.5% of revenue) supported cash generation. A pick-up in activity following the reopening is expected to support meal count and revenue expansion. As revenue recovers, we should benefit from significant operating leverage thanks to recurring reductions in our cost base secured during the pandemic. Our cost cutting initiatives gears us for further margin growth post-pandemic. Management deployed the various levers it has to reduce semi-variable and fixed costs through overhead, labor and occupancy cost reductions and renegotiations. We estimate that when volumes recover, the flow-through to EBITA for each €100 million of revenue generated will be approximately 25% to 30%. The illustrative direct impact of a revenue increase on EBITA increase (flow-through) is presented in the graph below. 105 ----- Elior remains confident that its platform and unique business model will provide it with the strength to seize opportunities emerging in the post-pandemic world. As we exit the pandemic, we are optimistic regarding both the short- and medium-term outlook. In the short-term, we believe that the United States and the United Kingdom are well positioned to bounce back sooner than France, Italy, and Spain due to the comparatively higher vaccination rate. September will be key given planned easing of restriction measures and structural seasonality. In the medium-term outlook, we believe that return to robust organic growth will be within sight. We further believe that improvement in our pre-crisis margins will be supported by structural cost optimization efforts. Permanent impact of work from home in Business & Industry volumes (around 20-30% of 18% of consolidated revenue) will be more than offset by new initiatives, new markets, and new clients. _Empowered local teams, underpinned by a strong entrepreneurial mindset_ We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our management team piloting a decentralized structure, underpinned by a strong entrepreneurial mindset. Our systematic control mechanism is deployed throughout the organization led by functional leaders. We are led by Philippe Guillemot, our Chief Executive Officer, who joined the Group in 2017 with particular expertise in running large organizations with a global footprint (especially in the US market) and building sustainable growth and operational excellence. Our senior management consists of the heads of our main country teams where we operate (France, Italy, North America, Spain, the United Kingdom), the head of our Services business and functional leaders who provide specialized direction and support for the execution of the Group’s strategy (finance, logistics, digital transformation, human resources and communications). Our management has a long history of operating in the catering and retail industries along with an enviable record of long-term profitable growth throughout business cycles. In addition, our structure is lean with few layers between top-management and front line. This encourages strong commitment and entrepreneurial spirit across the group, permitting our organization to seize opportunities as they become available and evolve in line with our markets and clients’ business models. Furthermore, we believe our empowerment of local leadership in each of our geographies, along with our entrepreneurial mindsets, allows top management to agilely take decisions for clear and focused strategies. This has been shown through the management’s actions during rapidly changing regulations imposed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting our business. Through their direction and guidance, we were able to quickly implement procedures to protect the health and safety of our employees, 106 ----- clients and guests, anticipate and prepare for the post-COVID-19 environment through investing in new revenue streams and support the mobilization and engagement of teams on the front line. Our management also concentrated on strict cash management and a swift adaptation of the organization to keep us in a solid position. As a result of our organizational structure, local management can remain focused on the future and anticipating the needs of our clients.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

We intend to execute our strategy with a focus on customer-centric innovation fueled the knowhow and expertise developed across our global platform and with an eye on people alignment and empowerment to fully leverage the maximum impact of our talented employees and asset base. _Shift business mix towards attractive markets and clients_ Elior intends to continue a polycentric approach to growth. While continuing to grow our core French business, we have successfully expanded our international presence into geographies with growing contract catering outsourcing trends, especially the United States and the United Kingdom. We are now well positioned to gear new business development towards the most attractive segments and clients. This allows us to secure higher margins by converting selfoperated catering services to new outsourced contracts. We expect to expand and further create value for clients through innovative offerings with supporting digital solutions and entering new markets, such as on-board catering for trains and grouped meal delivers to SMEs. We will focus on selected country specific adjacencies to support growth ambitions across segments. Further, we will continue to improve geographic and/or segment mix in order to protect revenue impacts from poor country or market segment performance. We will focus on a select number of countries to target local markets yet share the best practices, recipes, and offerings, such as Food360, Urban360, and the roll out in UK with ‘pods.’ We plan on expanding our leadership positions across several market segment in larger geographies, such as the United States in targeted market segments, such as community meals and corrections. _Increase customer centricity through CSR and increase cross-sell/upsell in services_ We intend to increase customer centricity with a clear and proactive focus on CSR. We plan on focusing on new concepts, increasing use of digital technology to provide new customer services, and direct end-client to drive footfall in business & industry and education with parents. Our digitally inspired innovation will drive new opportunities in response to changing customer trends. We continue digital innovation to complement traditional business & industry offerings because of the demand for high quality meals on-the-go, away from traditional catering settings. In France, Nestor allow us to expand the small and medium-sized addressable market. In the office, employees can use connected fridges and a click and collect app or have a delivery of fresh and tasty lunches directly to employees to enjoy in dedicated spaces. While working from home, Bites to Go allows employees the flexibility to take away via POS (fridges, vending machines or delivery). In the education market the trend is to focus on healthy, tasty, and nutritional meals in safe environments. Our innovation Weeky Daily is a click and self-service in schools and universities which offers teenager inspired meals in safe, social distanced spaces which increases our capture rate. In addition, Safe Café uses QR codes to deliver our health and safety standards which increases customer confidence and capture rate. The trend in health and welfare is personalized menus based on health and 107 ----- capabilities, available in traditional setting or at-home services. NutriAge is our innovation which identifies nutritional needs and delivers personalized plans, ensuring well-being for retirement home guests or the elderly via an at-home service. Further, Inéquatio adapts to people’s specific needs by ensuring the right food texture depending on their heath and capabilities. We intend to have an accelerated implementation of new offers for the Business & Industry market (asset light solutions, central production and digitally enabled services: ordering, click and collect, group delivery). We plan to increase capture rate with additional distribution formats and revised meus, such as grab & go and vegetarian expansion. We plan to continue to increase our cross-sell in our services through special works and facility management. For example, in the United States we have Kitchen on Demand initiatives. The Kitchen on Demand Strategy Council was put in place to leverage our cross-team collaboration to drive the full capacity utilization and expand footprint. Work streams were identified to accelerate entrance into new markets using cross segment teamwork. The pilot offerings were implemented across multiple market segments. _Systematic focus on retention_ Client retention is at the core of our business model and we are proud of the many clients we have been privileged to serve for many years. In contract catering, renewal of contacts often delivers better value for us and our clients as we are typically in the position to apply the knowhow gained in the previous performance of the contract, recalibrate pricing if necessary and adapt service offering to guest demand. Our strategy calls for reaching our target of 95% retention rate by continuing to strengthen our offer portfolio with existing clients, deploying systematic processes to apply lessons learned and improve our renewal pitch, and adopting various tools to monitor client satisfaction. We intend to proactively manage contracts and leverage new offers to retain smaller contracts (less than 150 meals per day) with new asset light formats. In Italy, we will drive retention rates with innovation showing new opportunities which include modified atmosphere packaging. This technology extends shelf-life of freshly cooked meals. We have untapped profitable opportunities up to 150 kilometers from our central productions units. _Continuous cost optimization_ We will continue to focus on cost control and efficiency measures, promoting a culture of constant improvement as an important part of our strategy. We intend to increase our share of centrally managed contracts to maximize volume rebates, while respecting local food traditions. We plan on optimizing food costs through maximizing the utilization of our central production unit capacity by, for example, which can be used to prepare meals that are served at other sites. We also intend to pursue optimization of overhead costs and selling, general and administrative expenses through shared services, right-sizing the layers within our organization and investing in process automation where it makes business sense to do so. Though we have already made improvements in labor force rationalization, we believe there are still optimization initiatives that can be gainfully harnessed. _Focus on cash management and allocation_ Cost control and cash generation remain core to our management’s strategy for the Group. Our plan includes a strong focus on cash management and efficient capital allocation. To do this we intend to monitor capital expenditure, investing in accordance with strict payback parameters. Furthermore, we are rolling out initiatives to improve working capital. For example, we aim to reduce working capital swings once volumes recover. We intend to limit and have a one-year-payback on non-recurring expenses, including restructurings. 108 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.55,History and Development,17.55.1,,"Since it was founded in 1991, we have grown from a contract caterer with operations only in France to an international group with two core businesses: contract catering and services. We currently operate in six countries. We were co-founded by Francis Markus and Robert Zolade who, together with 300 managers, acquired a 35% stake in Générale de Restauration, the contract catering subsidiary of the Accor group. In 1993, we entered the French concession catering market and became the market leader in 1997. In 1998 it adopted the name “Elior,” and in 1999 began accelerating our development in the European contract catering market through acquisitions in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. In 2000, we were first listed on the Premier Marché of Euronext Paris and shortly afterwards the Group expanded its concession catering business in Spain and Italy through partnerships with MyChef and Areas, and built up its presence in contract catering in Spain through an alliance with Serunion. The Group further diversified its business by entering the services industry in France in 2004 through the acquisition of Hôpital Service, a company that provides services for healthcare establishments (specialized cleaning and hospitality). In 2006, we delisted from Euronext Paris and were taken private by Charterhouse, Chequers and Robert Zolade. As from the beginning of 2010 the Group engaged in a number of acquisitions in various markets and businesses, beginning in that year with Copra, an Italian contract caterer, as well as Sin&Stes, one of France's leading corporate cleaning services firms, which pushed it up to the position of sixth-largest contract cleaning company in France. In 2011, the Group expanded its contract catering business in Spain by acquiring the Alessa Catering group. In early 2012, we consolidated our operations under the “Elior” brand name, which also became its trade name in France, the United Kingdom and Italy. Also in 2012, we acquired two contract catering companies: Gemeaz in Italy (which made us the country’s leading contract caterer), and Ansamble in France (which placed us as France’s joint leader in the contract catering market). In 2013, the Group entered the US contract catering market by acquiring TrustHouse Services (since renamed Elior North America), a leading player in the education and healthcare sectors in the United States. In October 2014, the Group acquired Lexington, a UK-based contract caterer specialized in high-end catering services in the City of London. On June 11, 2014, we were relisted on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. In 2015, the Group reinforced our position as a global player in the concession catering market by raising our stake in Areas to 100%. We also increased our contract catering presence in the United States by acquiring Starr Catering Group (since renamed Constellation Culinary Group), a US market leader that offers a full range of premium catering services. In 2016, THS took on the Group's flagship contract catering brand name, becoming Elior North America. During that year, Elior North America acquired ABL Management, which operates in the university and corrections segments, and Preferred Meals (specialized in contract catering and home deliveries in the education and seniors markets). In the United Kingdom, Elior acquired Waterfall Catering Group, which operates in the growth markets of education and healthcare, and as a result became the UK's fourth-largest contract caterer. The Group also made its entry into Asia in 2016, by simultaneously acquiring two contract caterers in India: MegaBite Food Services and CRCL. 109 ----- In 2017, the Group pursued the expansion of its contract catering activities in the United States by successively acquiring CBM Managed Services, Lancer Hospitality, Abigail Kirsch, Corporate Chefs, Design Cuisine and Sidekim. The acquisition of Corporate Chefs strengthened Elior North America's positions in the premium corporate catering market and the education sector. Lancer Hospitality provides professional food management services in a variety of settings including cultural venues, leisure attractions, business centers, schools and healthcare facilities. As it is based in Minnesota, the acquisition of Lancer Hospitality enabled the Group to broaden its presence in the US. In 2018, the Group acquired a new company in the United States – Bateman Community Living – reinforcing Elior North America's position in the seniors catering sector. In total, the Group has carried out 19 acquisitions in the United States in the space of three years. In 2019, having reviewed the strategic options for its concession catering business, Elior Group sold its subsidiary Areas, opening up a new chapter in its history by refocusing on its long-standing businesses of contract catering and services. At the same time, the Group launched its New Elior strategic plan, which sets out its roadmap up until 2024. Also in 2019, Elior reinforced its leading position in senior nutrition and community meals in the United States, by creating TRIO Community Meals, bringing together three regional brands. In the United Kingdom in 2019, then in the United States in 2020, Elior launched Lexington Independents to create a single brand to the serve independent schools. This new brand has strengthened the Group’s presence in the private education market, offering bespoke catering solutions for both pupils and teachers.

In the healthcare sector – which has been Elior Services' principal market since the outset and where it is the leader in France – the company offers a wide range of solutions including specialist cleaning services, laundry services, in-room meal services and hospitality services.

We have a similar infrastructure in the United States, giving us a strong platform for consolidating our leadership in that countries. Keenly aware of the role we have to play in educating tastes and encouraging healthy eating, the Group pays particular attention to the flavor of the food we serve, as well as to using local and certified food and “homemade” recipes. We also take care to pass on the message to your young guests about the importance of taking pleasure in eating well. One of the main challenges in the Education market for Elior, like other caterers, is to demonstrate the quality of our services and make market players aware that quality has a price tag. _Catering Solutions For Every Age_ Thanks to the expertise we have honed over the years, we offer innovative catering solutions tailored to the specific needs of each age group, from pre-school right through to university. We offer comprehensive catering solutions to help children make good food choices by themselves. And we are committed to providing transparent information about allergens (e.g. the Lunchhound solution in the UK) as well as the origin of the food we serve and its nutritional values (as illustrated by the rollout of the Nutri-Score system in France for example). _Giving Children a Taste for Healthy Eating_ The ingredients we use are selected by dieticians who ensure that our menus are balanced and varied. In order to help us propose innovative and diverse menus, in France, 10 new recipes are tested every month by a panel of 50 children. We also organize nutritional campaigns and anti-food-waste events to get the healthy and responsible eating message across to children, such as “Let’s have breakfast together,” which helps children understand how important it is to eat breakfast, and “Vegetable day.” During the year we also developed and launched a flexible home meal pack program offering breakfast and lunch for two, three or five days depending on the home-learning schedules of the schools concerned. _Clients_ Our clients in Education include: Comune di Pisa, Comune di Genova, Ville d’Issy-lesMoulineaux, Collège Stanislas, Ville de Lyon, London Business School, University of Roehampton, Conseil départemental des Hauts-de-Seine, Lycée français de Madrid, L’Oréal Madrid, RTVE, Télécom PariTech, Les Petits Chaperons Rouges, Savannah State University, Madison County Schools and Akron Public Schools.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

The Group's main clients in the Health & Welfare market are hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, residential homes and day-care centers for disabled, elderly and dependent people, and non-profit organizations that provide community meal services. Whatever the venue, 113 ----- meals form part of the overall care process in this market, and a good diet contributes to the recovery of patients and the well-being of care home residents. The Group designs catering offerings for health and welfare establishments that combine nutrition with the enjoyment of eating. In the hospital segment, catering solutions are tailored to each patient's pathology, and the new generation of cafeterias add to the well-being of both staff and visitors. For seniors, the Group draws on its expertise in food hygiene and safety, and has a strong focus on innovation. It specializes in specifically adapted textures and nutrient-rich food for seniors, and has developed solutions for delivering meals to people at home and in congregate settings. The Group's teams also offer support to clients that are adapting their business models to the increase in outpatient surgery, by providing new services for patients from before they are hospitalized until they go home, including a specially-adapted type of on-site catering. _Taking Care of Dependency_ Some elderly care home residents and people with disabilities are dependent, which means they have difficulties with basic actions, such as eating or drinking. To help make their everyday lives easier, we have designed specific solutions both for their meals (such as texture-modified foods) and their other needs (Elior Services’ hospitality solutions). _Eating Well to Get Better_ A healthy, balanced diet is often the first step to getting better. At Elior, we design concepts tailored to each type of patient and resident depending on their specific needs (e.g. for the elderly and people with disabilities) or on their pathology (cancer, Alzheimer’s, etc.). We also address the public health problem of malnutrition by creating concepts such as Énergie Saveurs in France, which offers specially enriched food, and Elior Italia’s NutriAge concept. NutriAge – which includes an initial nutritional diagnosis, personalized menus and long-term monitoring – has established Elior Italia as a veritable partner for care homes for the elderly and their residents in the fight against malnutrition and weight loss. _Championing Autonomy and Social Inclusion_ We partner our clients in health and welfare establishments in designing innovative solutions that help their residents and patients either retain or regain their independence. We also distribute meals for charitable organizations and centers for vulnerable people. And during the COVID-19 crisis, we reacted quickly to help people in need, notably through our TRIO Community Meals brand in the United States. _Fostering Synergies between Businesses_ Health & Welfare is the market that offers the most opportunities for leveraging synergies between catering and services, such as meals served in rooms. Elior Services’ offerings comprise many high added-value services, including specialized cleaning and a wide range of hospitality services (concierge services, pre- and post-hospitalization support, etc.). _Clients_ Our Health & Welfare clients include: Hôpital Foch, Ramsay Santé, Cancer Campus Gustave Roussy, Ospedale Luigi Sacco, Barts Health NHS Trust, CHU de Toulouse, Allegheny Valley Hospital, Louisiana Department of Health, Association Entraide Universitaire and Hospital Universitario de Burgos. 114 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Our sales approach varies by business line and by country, but across all of our lines of business, management and technical teams work closely to assemble an offer that is tailored to a potential client’s needs. To generate sales in our contract catering and facilities management businesses, we employ dedicated sales and marketing teams to identify potential new clients, negotiate business terms and sign new contracts. We provide bonus payments for our contract catering and facilities management sales teams in order to incentivize them to generate new client relationships. For contract catering sales and marketing in each country, we have industry based-teams. Our facilities management business also benefits from a sales team generally dedicated to facilities management other than the Health & Welfare market, as well as a sales team that specifically targets clients in the Health & Welfare market. Cross-selling between contract catering and facilities management has historically been limited in our continental 115 ----- European markets, whereas it has been more common in the United Kingdom. Because we operate both contract catering and facilities management businesses in France, we engage, to a limited extent, in cross-selling between those businesses. However, we tend to sell services to clients under separate contracts for contract catering, on the one hand, and facilities management, on the other hand, and not in a single, bundled contract, which we think is beneficial for our business because, among other things, our business is more stable due to contract diversification. To support our sales function, we have deployed across our geographies customer relationship management-based system that is used by both sales people and operators (approximately 1400 users in total) via a desktop or mobile interface.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

The length for fixed term contracts varies from three to five years, and there is no significant variation between countries and markets, though public sector contracts typically have a fixed duration that is proscribed by law (often three years) with an automatic extension option, usually for an additional three-year period. Private sector contracts can be open-ended with automatic extension. _Business & Industry. Contracts in the Business & Industry market can be priced based on a_ profit and loss model, a cost-plus model or a hybrid of the two. For profit and loss contracts, pricing is determined in advance on a per meal basis that is periodically adjustable based on a pre-agreed pricing index for food, staff and services. Contract revenue model in France typically is structured as a subsidy by transaction paid by the company with volume thresholds to cover fixed costs, whereas the price of the meal is paid by the guest covering food costs. In the United States and United Kingdom, the contract revenue model is typically a fixed annual subsidy paid by the employer, or no subsidy at all, with the guest paying the price of the meal. _Education and Health & Welfare. Our catering contracts for clients in the Education and Health_ & Welfare markets generally follow the same model and are subject to variations based on the public or private nature of the institution we serve. Depending on the size of the institution and certain other parameters, the contract revenue model may be retail, i.e. price per transaction paid by guests, fixed price fee paid by the client based on agreed budgets, or a fee paid by the client as a percentage of the total service cost. In the French public school system, typically we are paid a fixed price per meal by the public administration or directly by families involving collections by us, sometimes with volume thresholds applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

For the year ended September 30, 2020, 35.7% of our seafood products purchased were labelled under accreditation schemes, such as by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) or Best Aquaculture Practices. In addition, for the year ended September 30, 2020, 22.6% of our suppliers were responsibly sourced. We have put in place central purchasing policies in 2018 at the Group level which has rendered our procurement policy more efficient. Our Central Procurement function that has a double role: (1) provide strategic direction, policies, methods and best practices to the Group and (2) leverage the scale of the Group by procuring goods and services in the appropriate categories. International agreements might cover categories, like frozen vegetables, or include suppliers, such as Diversey, which covers our supply needs across Europe. We handle the operational supply needs of our businesses on a country-by-country basis. In each country, we operate a central purchasing department that handles the needs within that country in connection with the Central Procurement team. Approximately 30% of our purchases are done by Elior Procurement teams (central or local). The remaining 70% are done by distributors. We are party to distribution framework agreements with key distributors managing logistics hubs that serve as depots between our suppliers and our central kitchens and contract catering sites. 118 ----- Distributors may procure the supplies from industrial suppliers with whom we have signed preferential agreements (at terms agreed between us and the industrial supplier, with the distributor receiving a fee for its logistics service) or purchase them from other suppliers (in which case we agree the terms of our purchase with the distributor). Our preferential supply agreements typically have a three-year term, with volumes for key products generally prebooked one year in advance with no purchase obligation. The prices of supplies under these agreements are negotiated at regular intervals (typically every six to eight months) in order to account for fluctuations in price. Our other supply contracts generally have a one-year term, setting a fixed price but no purchase obligation for the supplies to be purchased thereunder. For information regarding our equipment contracts see the section “—Facilities and _Equipment—Equipment.”_ We endeavor to mitigate our exposure to any single key supplier or equipment manufacturer. However, we are reliant on certain key suppliers.

In 2019, the Group revised its Positive Foodprint objectives as well as its CSR governance methods. As stated above, due to the COVID-19 crisis, we have accelerated the rollout of our New Elior strategy – including the Positive Foodprint Plan – across all of our operations. Not least because sustainability is central to dealing with the current situation. And by building supply chains focused on safety, security and value we are making our Group more resilient to international crises. _Restated goals_ We have defined the objectives for the priority areas set in the Positive Foodprint Plan in order to align them as closely as possible with the reality of our operations. Performance indicators have been put in place to guide the Group’s action plans and assess the progress made (see table below). As a passionate campaigner for the transition to better food habits, we seek to transparently measure and constantly improve the value of our meals in terms of their impact on society, people and the environment. We endeavor to achieve this through offerings that: - Are healthy and provide guests with transparent nutritional information as well as a wide choice of vegetarian options. - Respect the environment, with a focus on certified sustainable supplies and measures to reduce food waste. - Give people enjoyable dining experiences, by carrying out satisfaction surveys and being a “chef-centric” group. In order to meet these objectives, each Elior Group subsidiary puts in place action plans and develops systems and processes to effectively address the challenges and restrictions of its particular market. _Stronger oversight_ The Group assesses all of its non-financial indicators once a year. For some of the Positive Foodprint Plan’s key performance indicators, however, we have set up a quarterly tracking 121 ----- process. On an aggregate basis, our non-financial performance indicators cover all of the geographic regions where we operate. In addition, so as to give a straightforward and transparent overview of the Group’s approach, Management has decided to report on some of these non-financial performance indicators when it releases its quarterly financial results. This means that all of its stakeholders can follow developments in the Group’s non-financial performance. _Contributing to Sustainable Development Goals_ The objectives in the Positive Foodprint Plan are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

A restricted risk universe was mapped out based on the Group’s business sectors, geographic locations and main strategic goals, incorporating around twenty risks (identified via the materiality analysis) that could significantly impact the Group’s business or its stakeholders. Out of this mapping process twelve main environmental, HR and social risks were identified: (1) Unethical practices and lack of transparency, (2) Failure to include CSR criteria in procurement practices, (3) Failure to adapt to guests' new expectations, (4) Poor hygiene and food safety, (5) Poor working conditions, (6) Inequality and discrimination, (7) Failure to attract and retain talent, (8) Failure to include CSR criteria in pay structures, (9) Failure to protect employees' health and safety in the workplace, (10) Poor resource and waste management, (11) Environmental pollution (water, air) and (12) Poor use of water and energy. In 2019-2020, we launched a project to integrate these twelve priority non-financial risks into our internal risk management system. This update to the non-financial risk map confirmed that the four pillars of the Positive Foodprint Plan are still highly relevant and did not identify any new CSR risks. Nine of the twelve risks already formed part of the risks regularly monitored by the Group. Two further risks have been added to the Group’s risk management system: waste management and climate change & environmental pollution (a merger of two risks identified in 2018). The gross criticality of these risks will be assessed using an approach consistent with that applied by the Risk Management Department, based on two criteria: the level of impact if the risk occurs and the probability that the risk will occur.

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Food safety regulations,58.1.1,Food safety and hygiene,"_European Union_ A set of rules known as the ""Hygiene Package"" has been applicable in the European Union since January 1, 2006. The introduction of this legislation was aimed at creating a single, transparent hygiene policy applicable to all food and all food operators right through the food chain ""from farm to fork,” together with effective instruments to manage food safety and any future food crises throughout the food chain. For its catering operations the Group is subject to five of the Hygiene Package's regulations: Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 dated January 28, 2002 (also called the “General Food Law”) lays down the general principles of food safety and covers foodstuffs intended for human consumption and animal feed. This Regulation also established the European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”) and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (“RASFF”) in the European Union. The EFSA assesses and communicates on all risks associated with the food chain in order to provide guidance and clarity for the policies and decision making of food safety risk managers. A large part of the EFSA's work entails issuing scientific opinions on matters that affect food safety. The EFSA uses its expertise in playing an advisory role for European legislation on food safety, deciding whether to approve regulated substances such as pesticides and food additives and developing regulatory frameworks and policies in the field of nutrition. 125 ----- The RASFF is an alert system that warns each EU country's health authorities whenever a risk is identified for a food product. The General Food Law establishes general principles (e.g. use of risk analyses by the relevant authorities, the precautionary principle, the principle of transparency and the protection of consumers' interests) and sets out specific obligations for professionals, including traceability, recalling any products that may present a public health risk, and informing the relevant inspection authorities. In particular, the General Food Law requires food business operators to ensure that businesses under their control satisfy the relevant requirements and to verify that such requirements are met at all stages of production, processing and distribution. It also imposes a mandatory traceability requirement along the entire food chain that applies to all food and all types of operators in the processing, transportation, storage, distribution and retail stages. Each food operator is required to register and retain for a period of five years detailed product information (including the name and address of the producer, the nature of the product and the transaction date) and make such records immediately available to the relevant authorities upon request. Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 dated April 29, 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs applies to all food businesses (including caterers, primary producers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers). This Regulation requires, among other things, that food chain players set up procedures based on the principles of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) which should take account of the seven Codex Alimentarius principles (a program set up jointly by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (“FAO”) and the World Health Organization). HACCP is a process control system which is used to identify potential food safety hazards and take action to reduce or eliminate the risks related to the various stages of the product manufacturing process, including ensuring the safety of raw materials, validating internal processes, shelf life and end-consumer usage. The Regulation also requires that employees undergo training on food hygiene matters and the application of HACCP principles. In addition, it sets out obligations for meal-delivery firms in terms of declaring and registering food information with the food control authorities and requesting authorizations. Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 dated April 29, 2004 includes more stringent requirements for food products of animal origin, such as meat, fish and dairy products, and foods containing such products. European legislation regulates the temperature settings at which these products must be kept as well as the length of time for which they can be displayed. Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005 dated November 15, 2005, as amended by regulation (EC) No. 2019/229 dated February 7, 2019, is an implementing regulation covering microbiological criteria for foodstuffs. These criteria are used for assessing the compliance of products when setting the shelf life of products or for health and hygiene controls. Regulation (EC) No. 2017/2158 dated November 20, 2017, establishing mitigation measures and benchmark levels for the reduction of the presence of acrylamide in food. _France_ In France, the main food safety regulator is the Agency for Food, the Environment and Occupational Health and Safety (Agence Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de _l'Environnement et du Travail, or “ANSES”). ANSES is a governmental agency that is_ overseen by the Ministries of Health, Agriculture, the Environment, Labor and Consumer Protection. It acts as a watchdog and advisory specialist for a wide range of issues related to human and plant health and animal health and welfare, and also carries out research activities 126 ----- in these areas. It applies a holistic approach to health issues by analyzing all of the related risks and benefits. It assesses all of the risks (chemical, biological, physical, etc.) to which an individual may be exposed - voluntarily or involuntarily - at all ages and times of their life, whether at work, when traveling, during leisure time, or through the food they eat. French food safety regulations incorporate the standards provided for in EU legislation on food safety. They also include the requirements of: The governmental decree of December 21, 2009 (consolidated version of May 25, 2020) concerning the temperature settings at which animal-derived products must be kept, and specific provisions relating to contract catering establishments (display dishes, the obligation to report to the authorities any suspected cases of food poisoning, procedures for managing unsold food etc.), supplemented by the decree dated October 8, 2013 relating to foodstuffs that are not derived from animal goods. The governmental decree of February 2, 2015 relating to the definition of the concept of local distribution, implementing Regulation (EC) No. 37/2005 and rescinding the decree dated July 20, 1998 setting the technical and hygiene conditions for food transportation. The governmental decree of June 8, 2006 concerning health and hygiene ratings for companies that market products of animal origin and foodstuffs containing animal products, as amended by decree on May 19, 2020. In addition, Elior France is subject to certain provisions of the French Rural Code (Code rural) dealing with food safety, epidemiology concerns related to products of animal origin, animal feed, and animal health. Elior France also has to follow the instructions issued by the French Food Safety Agency (Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Aliments) (“DGAL”), notably: - Technical Instruction DGAL/SDSSA 2019--38 dated January 1, 2019, which merges all of the DGAL memoranda relating to the approval procedure provided for in Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004. This instruction particularly specifies the approval procedure to be followed by central production units, events caterers and group cooking workshops, as well as the terms and conditions applicable for the Agency's delivery and tracking of health and hygiene certifications. - Technical Instruction DGAL/SDSSA/2020 – 289, which specifies the health and hygiene regulations applicable to retail trade and the transportation of animal-origin products and foodstuffs containing animal products. It presents the consequence of synchronous amendments to several ministerial decrees, including those of December 21, 2009 and April 12, 2017 defining the foodstuffs that cannot be included in donations to charitable organizations. It also merges and updates information previously included in several separate technical instructions in order to take into account recent regulatory and infra-regulatory developments. - Technical Instruction DGAL/SDSSA/2019-861, which provides a general description of the resources available to food industry players for determining, validating and verifying the microbiological shelf-life of the foodstuffs they produce and sell. Lastly, Elior France is subject to Article 50 of the so-called “EGALIM” Act (French Act no. 2018938 dated October 30, 2018) concerning balanced trade relations in the agricultural sector and access to healthy and sustainable food, which is referred to in the DGAL’s Technical Instruction DGAL/SDSSA/2019-555 dated July 30, 2019. This article incorporates one of the basic principles of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 in that it introduces a requirement for food 127 ----- operators to immediately inform the competent authorities if, based on their own risk assessment, they consider that a product may be injurious to human or animal health. _Italy_ In Italy, the main regulatory authority for food safety is the Ministry of Health. Decree no. 123 dated March 3, 1993, transposing into Italian law the European Council Directive 89/397/EEC of June 14, 1989 on harmonizing the official control of foodstuffs in the European Union, covers all stages of the food industry: production, manufacture, processing, storage, transport, distribution and trade. It authorizes the performance of the following operations: inspections, sampling, laboratory analysis of samples taken, verification of staff hygiene, and a review of formal documentation and systems used by companies. Italian food safety regulations incorporate the standards provided for in EU legislation on food safety. (Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004, Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005 - 1441/2007, Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC, and subsequent amendments and additions). Another major food safety regulation applicable in Italy is legislative decree 193, dated November 6, 2007, which entered into force on November 24, 2007 and concerns the implementation of Directive 2004/41/EC relating to safety controls on foodstuffs and the application of European Community regulations concerning such controls. This legislative decree sets out the sanctions that apply in the event of non-compliance with EU food safety regulations, notably regulations 852/2004 and 853/2004. The other major food safety regulations applicable in Italy are Regulation No. 1169 of October 2011 relating to labeling, and legislative decree 231 of December 2017 concerning sanctions. In addition to national and European-level food safety and hygiene regulations, the Group is subject to regional and provincial food safety obligations in Italy. The main food safety supervisory bodies in Italy are: - The Ministry of Health, notably through programs set up by the food safety and nutrition department (Direzione generale per l'igiene e la sicurezza degli alimenti e la _nutrizione)._ - The public health institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanità). - The Italian police's food and drug control unit (Nuclei Antisofisticazione e Sanità _(N.A.S.) _dei Carabinieri), whose role is mainly to prevent and sanction._ - The local health authorities (Aziende Sanitarie Locali) which have inspection powers. - The government’s veterinary services. - The Ministry of Agriculture (Ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali). _Spain_ In Spain, the main food safety regulator is the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (Agencia Española de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición, or the “AESAN”). The Group is subject to food safety regulations promulgated and enforced by the AESAN at national level, such as the General Health Act 14/1986, the Consumers and Users Protection Act 1/2007 and the Food Safety and Nutrition Act 17/2011. 128 ----- As well as being required to hold specific authorizations to conduct business as a food operator in Spain, since the promulgation of Royal Decree 3484/2000 of December 2000 and Royal Decree 126/2015 of February 2015, the Group is also subject to specific hygiene rules for preparing pre-cooked meals as well as requirements to ensure that food handlers are supervised and instructed in food hygiene matters in a way that is commensurate with their professional activities. In addition to national food safety laws and regulations, the Group is also subject to specific obligations under local regulations applicable in the Spanish autonomous regions in which it operates. _United Kingdom_ In the United Kingdom, the main food safety regulators are the Food Standards Agency (the “FSA”) for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Food Standards Scotland (“FSS”) for Scotland. The FSA and FSS are responsible for food safety and food hygiene across the United Kingdom. They work with local authorities to enforce food safety regulations and inspect meat plants to check compliance with the applicable regulations. The FSA also commissions research related to food safety. Key laws applying to food safety and hygiene in the UK include the General Food Law Regulation (EC) 178/2002 as well as the Food Safety Act of 1990 and Northern Ireland’s Food Safety Order of 1991, as amended to bring them into line with the EU General Food Law. The four countries of the United Kingdom have their own statutory rules which are detailed in: - The Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013. - The Food Safety and Hygiene (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2012. - The Food Hygiene (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2012. - The Food Hygiene (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2006. In conjunction with the legislation, the FSA writes guidance when there is a significant risk to food safety within the UK. In the United Kingdom, the FSA, FSS and local authorities work in partnership to operate three food safety rating schemes: The Food Hygiene Rating System (FHRS) in England and Northern Ireland, the Food Hygiene Rating Act (Wales) 2013 and the Food Hygiene Information Scheme (“FHIS”) in Scotland. Within the UK, there is a statutory scheme called Primary Authority – established by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 – which allows an eligible business to form a legally recognized partnership with a single local authority in relation to regulatory compliance. Elior UK has a direct partnership with Cheshire East Council, which acts as the company's Primary Authority, giving it authorizations and advice in relation to its management systems for food safety, hygiene and other safety issues. _United States_ In the United States, food safety regulations are promulgated at the federal, state and local level. State and local agencies issue the regulations to be applied by restaurants and other catering establishments located within their jurisdiction. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publishes the Food Code, a model that assists food control jurisdictions at all levels of government by providing them with a scientifically sound technical and legal basis for regulating food safety within the food services industry. Most States use the FDA Food Code as a model to develop or update their own food safety rules and to be consistent with national food regulatory policy. The FDA regulates all foods and food ingredients introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce, with the exception of meat, poultry, and certain processed egg products, which are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture. 129 ----- For the Group's US operations, hygiene and food safety are principally governed by local and federal rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are adopted by the FDA by way of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The Group's regulatory compliance measures in the United States include: - Outsourcing food safety and hygiene audits to an approved independent organization. - Pest management. - Using the services of an independent inspection company. - Using ""safety information sheets"" drawn up by a specialized chemical safety services firm. - Commissioning an accredited laboratory to carry out tests on meals served. All of the Group's distributors and suppliers are authorized and approved by local and state regulatory bodies and comply with the 2013 Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). All of the Group's food managers are required to follow a food safety training course and to obtain food manager certification, which needs to be renewed every five years. The Group operates in 48 different US States, which each have their own food hygiene rules and regulations. As well as its catering activities, Elior North America has food production and processing operations which must be compliant with HACCP (Hazard and Critical Control Points) and HARPC (Hazard Analysis and Risk-based Preventive Controls) rules. _India_ In India, food safety regulations are promulgated at federal and state level. At federal level, the main food safety agency is the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (the “FSSAI”). The FSSAI regulates all foods proposed for sale, including dairy products and products containing poultry. It also certifies all commercialized food ingredients and products and each operator and vendor must have FSSAI certification, which is renewed annually following a detailed inspection. A state-level liaison officer regularly verifies that the applicable regulations and requirements are complied with. In addition, a regulatory authority carries out compliance inspections at regular intervals, and all operators have to follow a certified food safety training program and have a supervisor who has received training under the Food Safety Training and Certification (“FoSTAC”) program. Elior India only deals with suppliers which are FSSAI certified and uses an independent national company for performing prevention checks.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Food safety regulations,58.1.2,Food labeling,"Prepacked food that the Group sells must comply with European Union labeling requirements, notably European Directive 2000/13/EC of March 20, 2000 relating to the labeling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs. The applicable EU Law on the provision of food information to consumers was consolidated and updated by EU Regulation 1169/2011 of October 25, 2011, which has been effective since December 13, 2014. This Regulation makes a distinction between the information that must be given for prepacked food and non-prepacked food, and provides for harmonized and 130 ----- compulsory nutritional information labeling for prepacked food effective December 2016. In its catering activities, the Group is required to provide information on whether its food contains any of the 14 major allergens set out in Annex II of this Regulation. Other EU regulations concerning food labeling include Regulation (EC) No. 1379/2013, which amends the labeling requirements for fishery and aquaculture products, and Regulation (EC) No. 1337/2013, which amends the labeling requirements for meat from pigs, sheep, poultry and goats. Local and national authorities may also introduce specific regulations or decrees clarifying particular points in the European regulations. For example: - In France, the implementing decree 2015/447 dated April 17, 2015 – which has been effective since July 1, 2015 – clarifies the procedures for applying Regulation (EC) No. 1169/2011; decree no. 2002-1465 has regulated the labeling of beef in catering establishments since December 17, 2002; and the government order dated May 5, 2017 sets out the conditions for labeling manufactured nanomaterials in foodstuffs. - In Italy, several documents have been published relating to Regulation (EC) No. 1169/2011, including two memoranda issued by the Ministry of Health on February 6, 2015 related to information on the presence of allergens in food and beverages and the Ministry of Health/Ministry of Economic Development on November 16, 2016 related to foodstuffs that are not subject to nutritional disclosure requirements. - The Italian government has also issued a Legislative Decree related to EC Regulation No. 1169/2011 (decree No. 231 dated December 15, 2017, which came into force on May 9, 2018): ""Sanctions applicable in the event of a breach of Regulation (EC) No. 1669/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, and alignment of national legislation with Regulation (EC) No. 1669/2011 and Directive 2011/91/EU, in accordance with Article 5 of Act no 170-2015 dated August 12, 2016 on European delegation.” These provisions are in line with the following standards of the Codex Alimentarius international food safety standards: o CODEX STAN 1–1985 (Rev.1-1991), Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods, and the subsequent amendments thereto. o CAC/GL 1-1979 (Rev. 1-1991), General Guidelines on Claims, and the subsequent amendments thereto. o CAC/GL 2-1985 (Rev. 1-1993), Guidelines on Nutrition Labeling, and the subsequent amendments thereto. o CAC/GL 23-1997 (Rev. 1-2004), Guidelines for Use of Nutrition and Health Claims, and the subsequent amendments thereto. - In Spain, food labeling is governed at national level by Royal Decree 126/2015, which sets out disclosure requirements concerning ready-to-eat, non-prepacked food. - In the United States, food labeling is generally regulated by the US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). - The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) prohibits false and misleading labeling and sets out the labeling requirements for processed and prepacked food. 131 ----- Prepacked food provided in locations where food is “served for immediate consumption,” such as catering establishments, hospitals, schools, cafeterias, bakeries, etc., must comply with sections 101.1 et seq. of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) which state that labels must show the common name of the food item, its ingredients, the name/place of sale, its net quantity and its nutrition claims. In addition, any potential presence of the main food allergens must be stated on the labels (and any other forms of display). Since May 7, 2018, restaurants and similar retail food establishments that are part of a chain with 20 or more locations, doing business under the same name, and offering for sale substantially the same menu items have also been subject to ""menu labeling regulations.” These regulations state that such establishments have to provide calorie information for standard menu items and ensure that additional nutrition information is available on request.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Food safety regulations,58.1.3,Other food service-related regulations,"In recent years, a number of national and local authorities have introduced specific regulations motivated by concerns about public health and environmental protection. These regulations cover, among other things, enhanced nutritional information for foodstuffs, requirements to use recyclable packaging, and additional taxes on food and beverages with high sugar content. Additionally, the Group's operations in the education sector can be subject to specific regulations concerning the nutritional quality of meals served in school restaurants. This is notably the case in France (Decree 2011--1227 of September 30, 2011). Pursuant to this decree, the Group has a number of obligations it is required to respect in relation to drawing up menus for restaurants in state-run and private schools, in accordance with the recommendations set out in the French National Nutrition and Health Program (Programme _National Nutrition Santé) and those issued by the GEMRCEN (a French governmental think-_ tank specialized in nutritional issues in the contract catering industry). New food service-related regulations were introduced in France in 2020: Act 2020-105 dated February 10, 2020 concerning the fight against waste and for a circular economy, which includes anti-food waste provisions and provides for ending the sale of single-use plastic packaging; and the related Decree (no. 2020-731 dated June 15, 2020) relating to the VAT exemption on donations of unsold goods to state-recognized social charities. Restaurant facilities are also subject to regulations promulgated by national, regional and local authorities covering a wide range of matters such as the utilization and maintenance of restaurant sites and equipment and waste storage and disposal. In addition, for catering sites or points of sale at which the Group serves alcohol, it is required to obtain liquor licenses and is subject to ongoing alcoholic beverage control obligations. Elior UK has developed tailored learning programs to teach its employees about the legislation related to serving alcohol, and in Scotland all employees who handle and serve alcohol are required to follow a two-hour training course beforehand. In Portugal, Decree Law No. 10/2015 dated January 16, 2015 approved the legal framework for (i) accessing and exercising trade activities and food and beverage services and (ii) accessing trade, services and catering activities (RJACSR). The Group is also required to comply with anti-smoking laws prohibiting smoking at dining establishments, such as the laws applicable in France since January 1, 2008 and in Italy since January 10, 2005 (Law no. 3/2003 dated January 16, 2003). 132 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

The regulatory framework evolved rapidly in 2019-2020 as the crisis advanced and as governmental decisions were taken. The fast-moving changes required all of our teams to be highly reactive and adaptable, not only in the sectors that were initially heavily impacted by reduced activity (Business & Industry and Education) but also in sectors that were stretched for resources, such as Health & Welfare. In each of its operating countries, the Group implemented all of the measures it could to adjust its resources and organization to the situation. In particular, employees were asked to take paid vacation, internal mobility was encouraged, and short-time working and furlough programs were used. The Group was often one step ahead concerning health and safety protocols, advising its clients how to define and implement them, which meant it could provide a continuity of service that matched their needs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,Laws and regulations governing employment contracts,58.2.1,Collective bargaining agreements,"Under French, Spanish and Italian law, the employer-employee relationship is not only regulated by applicable legislation and the employment contract executed between both parties, but also by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements (""CBAs""). CBAs may exist at national, regional or local level or be specific to a particular company. CBAs are agreements entered into between one or several trade union organizations representing employees, on the one hand, and an employer, or group of employers, on the other hand. National labor laws and CBAs constitute important sources of obligations relating to working conditions and govern the individual and collective relationships between employers and employees for the relevant industry. CBAs typically address (with respect to individual employees) matters such as working conditions and employment-related benefits, pay scales (with an industry specific minimum wage), working time, sickness and maternity leave, professional training, paid vacation, social welfare coverage and retirement fund contributions, year-end bonuses and financial terms of dismissals or retirement. 133 ----- The scope of each national CBA is defined by reference to a given industry or type of business. Therefore, the applicable CBA for a company depends its principal business activity. Owing to the broad range of the Group's services, from diverse catering services to facility management services, it is subject to several different CBAs. As the terms of CBAs can vary significantly from one activity to another, within the same country the Group may have different responsibilities towards different categories of employees based on the business in which they operate. All CBAs provide for a minimum wage that varies according to the classification of employees and the applicable pay scale. However, the wage of an employee cannot be below the statutory minimum wage that is set for all employees, regardless of classification, at national level. Trade unions renegotiate the terms of the industry-wide CBAs almost every year, including the terms of any increase in the minimum wage for each employee category. Companies to which the CBAs apply have an obligation to comply with these provisions by granting at least a corresponding salary increase every year, failing which employees may make legal claims for the enforcement of the industry-wide CBAs, back pay and damages. In France, employers may also enter into company-wide CBAs to address specific matters such as working time, salary levels, and welfare benefits.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Part-time employment is subject to specific laws and regulations in some of the countries where the Group operates. For example, under French law, part-time employment contracts must include certain mandatory provisions, such as the number of hours worked per week or per month, the arrangements for communicating the scheduling of hours worked per week or per month, and the maximum number of overtime hours that the employee can work per month. If a company is found not to be in compliance with regulations on part-time employment, the employee concerned may seek to reclassify his or her part-time employment contract as a full-time employment contract, and may also claim back pay and damages. The Group is likewise restricted in the manner in which it may hire temporary workers. For example, under French law, an employer wishing to take on non-permanent workers may either hire an employee under a fixed-term employment contract or take on a temporary worker through an agency. The use of fixed-term employment contracts/temporary workers must be restricted to the performance of clearly defined and temporary tasks in specific circumstances provided by law (e.g., (i) to replace an employee on a temporary leave of absence or whose employment contract is suspended, (ii) to temporarily fill a position before an employee can be hired under a permanent employment contract or, after a permanent employee has left, before the position is eliminated, or (iii) to cover a temporary increase in the company's business).

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,Laws and regulations governing employment contracts,58.2.3,Employee representation,"_Right to representation and trade unions_ In the majority of the countries in which the Group operates, its employees have the legal right to elect representatives from among their ranks to act as a liaison between the workforce and management. Such employee representatives are responsible for presenting to the employer all requests and grievances from employees, notably regarding compensation and compliance with applicable labor laws and CBAs. The employer is required to regularly provide the employee representatives with information regarding various matters such as working conditions and the company's financial situation. Depending on the country, employee 134 ----- representatives may also be responsible for notifying the relevant labor regulation enforcement authority of any claims or grievances from employees related to a breach of labor laws or regulations. Employers may also be exposed to the risk of strikes and work stoppages. In addition, employees may choose to join a trade union to represent their interests. Depending on the country concerned and the size of any given worksite, the Group may be obliged to recognize the trade union and allow employees to unionize. In certain countries, such as France, there is a limited number of nationally-recognized trade unions that are given the legal authority to negotiate national and company-specific CBAs. _Works councils – Employee representative bodies_ In accordance with EU law, the Group has a European works council in place that serves as a forum for employee representatives to engage in direct discussions with members of Group management. EU law requires any company that has (i) subsidiaries in at least two different EU member states, (ii) at least 1,000 employees in EU or EEA member states, and (iii) a minimum of 150 employees in at least two EU member states, to set up a European works council (an “EWC”). EWCs bring together employee representatives from the different European countries in which a multinational company has operations. During EWC meetings, employee representatives are informed and/or consulted by Group management on transnational issues that concern the Group's employees. National labor laws in most of the countries in which the Group operates also require the establishment of a local Social and Economic Committee (“SEC”) The frequency of SEC meetings, the amount of information that must be provided to its members, and how SEC opinions must be taken into account vary from country to country. In France, certain employer decisions relating to issues such as workforce reductions or changes in the legal and/or financial organization of the company (in particular in the case of a merger or a sale of assets or shares) require a prior information and/or consultation process to be carried out with the relevant SECs (local and/or central and/or European). In such cases, no final decision may be taken before the relevant employee representative body has delivered its formal opinion (whether negative or positive) on the proposed decision. _Employee representation on corporate boards_ In France, employees may be represented on their company's Board of Directors (or Supervisory Board where applicable). Companies that for the past two consecutive fiscal years have had either (i) 1,000 permanent employees or more on their payroll who work for the company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries with registered offices located in France, or (ii) 5,000 permanent employees or more worldwide who work for the company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries with registered offices located in France and abroad, must appoint at least one – and in certain cases – two Board members representing employees. Article L. 22-10-7 of the French Commercial Code provides that a holding company whose principal activity is to acquire and manage subsidiaries and affiliates is not subject to this requirement concerning employee representation on its board, if it meets both of the following criteria: - It is not required to put in place a social and economic committee pursuant to Article L. 2311-2 of the French Labor Code. - It owns, either directly or indirectly, one or more subsidiaries that are subject to the above requirement. - Its shares are not traded on a regulated market or at least four-fifths of its shares are held, directly or indirectly, by one person or legal entity, acting alone or in concert. 135 ----- Consequently, in accordance with the French Commercial Code, at the Annual General Meeting of March 20, 2020, the shareholders approved amendments to the Company's bylaws providing for the appointment of two employee representative members of the Board of Directors. In addition, for companies whose shares are traded on a regulated market, if at the close of the last fiscal year employees held more than 3% of the share capital, the company's shareholders must appoint one or more employees to the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board to represent employee shareholders, who are put forward by the shareholders referred to in Article L. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code. _Workplace health and safety_ The Group is also subject to regulations related to employees' health and safety in the workplace. Such regulations may require companies to put in place operational procedures to ensure that their working practices are safe and to reduce potential workplace hazards. Occupational health and safety matters are regulated and enforced by a variety of authorities, including the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, the French _Directions _régionales des entreprises, de la concurrence, de la consommation, du travail et de l'emploi_ (regional directorates of companies, competition, consumption, labor and employment), the UK Health & Safety Executive, and the US Occupational Safety and Health Agency. 136 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,136,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS,136.5,Receivables securitization programs,136.5.1,,"Certain French entities of the Group were beneficiaries under a €200 million receivables securitization program, which was entered into in November 2006 and amended several times after that date (the “2006 Securitization Program”). The 2006 Securitization Program was refinanced in May 2013 (the “2013 Securitization Program”) and its maximum amount was increased to €300 million. In addition, the 2013 Securitization Program was extended to include certain Spanish and Italian entities of the Group. The 2013 Securitization Program was refinanced in July 2017 (the “2017 Securitization Program”) and its maximum amount was increased to €322 million. The Group's Italian entities no longer form part of this program. In March 2019, the maximum amount of the program was raised to €360 million. On October 13, 2020, the €360 million 2017 Securitization Program, which was originally scheduled to expire in July 2021, was amended in order to extend its maturity until October 2024 and to ensure compliance with the criteria provided for in Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and the Council of December 12, 2017 laying down a general framework for securitization and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardized securitization. The amendments concerned do not affect the accounting treatment applied to the 2017 Securitization Program. Under the 2017 Securitization Program (representing a maximum of €360 million), trade receivables arising from sales carried out or services rendered in France and Spain in relation to commercial contracts (subject to certain eligibility criteria) denominated in euros and originated by any Elior Group Receivables Seller are sold to Ester Finance Titrisation, (the “Purchaser”), a French subsidiary of Crédit Agricole CIB. The sales are carried out monthly, based on receivables arising in the previous month, and receivables are fully financed without a guarantee deposit. The 2017 Securitization Program comprises two compartments: An “ON compartment” whereby receivables are sold with recourse and an “OFF compartment” whereby receivables are sold without recourse. For the ON compartment, as the Group continues to bear a significant portion of late payment and credit risks, the sold receivables do not meet the conditions required under IFRS 9 for off 148 ----- balance-sheet accounting. Consequently, the financing received is accounted for as debt. Sales to the Purchaser are made at the face value of the receivables, less a discount to reflect the financing costs until settlement. As of September 30, 2020, outstanding securitized receivables relating to the ON compartment, net of the related €26 million overcollateralization reserve, stood at €50 million. For the OFF compartment, credit risks, interest rate risks and late payment risks are transferred to the Purchaser through the discount applied on the receivables, which corresponds to remuneration for the credit risk and the financing cost. Dilution risk, assessed as part of the overall risks and benefits analysis, is not deemed to be a risk associated with the receivables. Under the terms of the OFF compartment: (a) The receivables transfers are valid and binding on third parties (other than the debtors if no notification is given). (b) The Elior Group receivables sellers consisting of certain subsidiaries in France and Spain (the “Elior Group Receivables **Sellers”) may only repurchase their sold receivables in specific circumstances (e.g. Disputed Receivables, Defaulted Receivables). (c) The Purchaser may only have recourse against the Sellers with respect to matters for which the Sellers are responsible, such as in the case of Dilution (excluding any guarantees for the payment of invoices). (d) The Program provides a precise definition of Dilutions in order to avoid any return of risks to the Sellers for reasons related to the debtor (e.g. deliberate payment delaying tactics or falsely disputing amounts due, with a clear definition of disputes, and offsetting only possible in valid circumstances). (e) If a default event occurs, this event terminates the program from thereon but does not affect any receivables sales that have already been carried out. (f) The applicable financial terms and conditions of the sales are set at the sale dates and no amendments with retroactive effect may be made to such financial terms and conditions. (g) The eligibility criteria applicable to the receivables are objective. (h) The sold receivables must not involve any performance risk (i.e. the receivables are due under contracts for which the services have already been rendered). (i) As of September 30, 2020, the amount of derecognized receivables totaled €206 million, compared with €217 million as of September 31, 2019. The Purchaser settles its receivables purchases from the Elior Group Receivables Sellers on a monthly basis. Between settlement dates, the Elior Group Receivables Sellers may use cash received from clients, which is paid into segregated bank accounts dedicated to the transaction and swept monthly to the Purchaser's bank account (subject to netting against the purchase price owed for newly originated receivables, unless a default event has occurred). Responsibility for administering receivables, including adherence to established credit and collection policies, remains with the Elior Group Receivables Sellers, with Elior Participations S.C.A. acting as the centralizing entity for such administration. Certain specified events would terminate the Securitization Program. These include (without limitation) events relating to the performance of the receivables, payment default exceeding €40 million on any debt contracted by the Elior Group Receivables Sellers or under certain 149 ----- other indebtedness of the Group, and accelerated repayment exceeding €40 million in relation to any debt contracted by the Elior Group Receivables Sellers or under certain other indebtedness of the Group. Direct recourse to the Elior Group Receivables Sellers is limited (i) for the ON compartment, to the amount of the overcollateralization reserve of the receivables, and (ii) for the OFF compartment, to the amount of the dilution reserve. In addition, the Purchaser has been granted a guarantee by Elior Participations S.C.A. for amounts due to the Purchaser by the Elior Group Receivables Sellers up to a maximum principal amount of €367 million. The Purchaser's commitment to finance the purchase of receivables originally ended in July 2021 but the contract was renewed on October 13, 2020 for a further four years. On July 29, 2016, an on-balance sheet receivables securitization agreement with a three-year term was put in place for a number of the Group's UK subsidiaries, representing a maximum amount of GBP 30 million. This agreement was terminated on August 22, 2019 when all of the sold receivables were repurchased by their sellers. As of March 31, 2021, outstanding securitized receivables under this program – net of the related €34.5 million overcollateralization reserve – was €45.1 million. 150 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

For the purposes of this “Description of Notes,” a “Guarantor” means the Initial Guarantors and any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto). The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by each relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. See “Limitations on the _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and_ “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Guarantees—The Guarantees may be _limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The Guarantees will be further limited as required under the_ Agreed Guarantee Principles that will apply to, and restrict the granting of guarantees in favor of obligations under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Initially, that agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC (the “Paying Agent”). The Issuer may change the Paying Agent without prior notice to the Holders.

The,21.9.1,,"Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Registrar shall prevail. Upon prior written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as they are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market of the Exchange and the rules and regulations thereof so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Holders will not be responsible for any service charge for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange. 160 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any such Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee, the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net amount received in respect of such payments by each Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts) will be not less than the amount that would have been received in respect of such payments if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a Holder of any Note in respect or on account of: (a)   any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of a present or former connection of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a place of business or a place of management present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than the mere receipt or holding of any Note or by reason of the receipt of payments thereunder or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture; (b)   any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) of any Note, to comply with the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder, providing at least 30 calendar days’ notice before any such withholding or deduction would be payable, to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements concerning nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which the Holder or such beneficial owner is legally required to satisfy, whether imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice, in each such case by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction), provided that the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to satisfy such requirements; (c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes; (d) any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect to any Note or Guarantee; 161 ----- (e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation (where presentation is required in order to receive payment) by the Holder for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting the same for payment on any day (including the last day) within such 30-day period; (f) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to Sections 1471–1474 of the U. S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U. S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or (g) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor to the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) if such Holder or beneficial owner is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would have been excluded had the relevant beneficial owner been the Holder of the Note. In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect of any combination of the above items. The Issuer or any Guarantor will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of Taxes and remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with all applicable laws. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will, upon request, make available to the Holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payment by the Issuer or the Guarantor. At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 45th day prior to the date on which payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer or a Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as is necessary to enable the Trustee or Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to the Holders on the payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. In addition, the Issuer or any Guarantor will pay (i) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer, documentation, court, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest or penalties with respect thereto imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in respect of the execution, issue, delivery or registration of, or receipt of payments with respect to the Notes, the Indenture or a Guarantee, or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than transfers of the Notes following the initial resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers) (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes, the Indenture or a Guarantee, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (c) and (e) through (g)); and (ii) any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, any Guarantee 162 ----- or the Indenture or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply _mutatis _mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor_ person to the Issuer or a Guarantor is organized, engaged in business or resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes or any Guarantee, or any political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, having the power to tax. Whenever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal (and premiums, if any), redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note (including payments made pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts thereon.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied provided, however, that, in any case such redemption date shall not be more than 60 days from the date on which such notice to holders of the Notes is first given, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for any selection made under this paragraph. If any Definitive Registered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to that Definitive Registered Note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued and delivered in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. 163 ----- If a redemption date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on such redemption date if it were a Business Day for the intervening period.

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of the Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, Registrar and each Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes appearing in the security register on such date, which notice will state: (a) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred; (b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control; (c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a business day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days after the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with any requirements under the Exchange Act or any other applicable securities laws or regulations; (d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid on such date; (e) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and (f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. (3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control, the Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form or to each Holder of certificated Notes; _provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral_ multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. (4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) the Notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” or (ii) a third party has made, and not 178 ----- terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the manner and at the times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal to at least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such tender offer. No Note will be purchased in part if less than €100,000 in original principal amount of such Note would remain outstanding following such purchase. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer and any Guarantor will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and each Guarantor will comply with such applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default under the Group’s existing debt. The Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries, may also contain provisions that, if certain events occur, would require such debt to be repurchased. In addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under existing debt and any such future debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer or any Guarantors of such repurchase. Not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a Change of Control and may not result in a Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes. The provisions of the Indenture will not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in the event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including those described under “— _Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.” The existence, however, of a Holder of the Notes’_ right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a Change of Control. If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were available, the terms of any other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfil its repurchase obligations to Holders of Notes who accept the Change of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes the rights described under _“—Events of Default.” An Event of Default under the Indenture unless waived, would result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there 179 ----- may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

(4) The Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be discharged and be of no further force and effect): (a) upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination) or conveyance, transfer or lease of the Capital Stock, or all or substantially all of the assets, of that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to the transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenants described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Asset Sales” or “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;_ (b) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of that Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any Holding Company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or through a Holding Company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the provisions set forth below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset _Sales” and as a result of such disposition such Guarantor no longer qualifies as a_ Subsidiary of the Issuer; (c) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that complies with the provisions under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge;” (d) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a Holding Company thereof) as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Indenture; (e) upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (f) upon repayment in full of the Notes; (g) the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; (h) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant the first paragraph of this covenant, the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes; or (i) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.” Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of any Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee will execute, subject to the receipt of certain Officer’s Certificates and an opinion of counsel, any documents reasonably required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of the Guarantee. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect the Guarantees or any such release, termination or 183 ----- discharge.

If such payments are made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments (subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated each year. Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer's taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account held in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219-I of the French Tax Code (i.e. 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate of 12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty). 236 ----- Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code nor, to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of such Deductibility Exclusion will apply in respect of the Notes if the Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest and assimilated revenues in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”). Pursuant to the administrative guidelines published by the French tax authorities regarding this legislation (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30 dated February 24, 2021, § 150 and BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20 dated February 24, 2021, § 290 (the “BOFIP”)), the Notes will benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any evidence supporting the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes, and accordingly will be able to automatically benefit from the Exception (the “Safe **Harbor”), if the Notes are: - offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code for which the publication of a prospectus is mandatory or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a state other than a Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an “equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the registration or submission of an offering document by or with a foreign securities market authority); and/or - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral financial instruments trading facility, provided that such market or facility is not located in a NonCooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator, an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; and/or - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and payment systems operator within the meaning of Article L.5612 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State. The Notes issued by the Issuer under this Offering Memorandum qualify as debt securities under French commercial law. Considering that: (i) as of the date of their admission to trading, the Notes will be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market in Luxembourg which does not qualify as a Non-Cooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and/or (ii) the Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and payment systems operators within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments made by the Issuer in respect of the Notes to their holders will fall under the Safe Harbor and will thus not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, as construed by the French tax authorities under the BOFIP. Moreover, under the same conditions, pursuant to the BOFIP and to the extent that the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and assimilated revenues paid by the Issuer on the Notes should not be subject to the Deductibility Exclusion and, as a result, should not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid on an account held in a financial institution established in a NonCooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in a NonCooperative State. 237 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of the acquisition or the subscription of its own shares by a third party. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each Guarantee by a Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to such Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such Guarantor under its Guarantee. Any payment made by a Guarantor under its Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce _pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such Guarantor or its_ subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. No Guarantor will be acting jointly and severally with the Issuer and/or the other Guarantors as regards its obligations. _Fraudulent conveyance_ French law contains specific “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in the context of the insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du _plan), 239 ----- or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the relevant debtor (if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court- appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’execution du plan)) or the concerned creditor (if the claim was lodged by such creditor) if: (a) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (b) the relevant creditor or (in the case of a claim lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’execution du plan) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act ; and (c) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of such Guarantee could be (a) declared unenforceable against all the creditors if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du _plan) or (b) declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the relevant Guarantee and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes or the relevant Guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.4,LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees,206.4.2,Italy,"Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate Benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and it is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory 240 ----- auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for a downstream guarantee in respect of financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream guarantee (i.e., guarantee granted in respect of financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of such guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group (without duplication), while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of such guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the guarantee granted by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and downstream guarantees granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. _Financial Assistance_ 241 ----- In addition, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. _Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_ Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee by an Italian company is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). _Limitations to the Guarantees_ In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial assistance, the maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (each, an “Italian **Guarantor”) may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, as regards to any Italian Guarantor: (i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans advanced from time to time to the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Issue Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that time; and 242 ----- (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations of any of the Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor will be subject to the Agreed Guarantee Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. _Undercapitalization_ Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata), will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Moreover, under the current provision of article 2467, first paragraph, of the Italian Civil Code (not yet modified by the amendments envisaged under article 383 of the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019) any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as joint stock companies (società per azioni), hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are joint stock companies (società per azioni). Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. 243 ----- Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) during the period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable subordination” rule. The applicability of these extraordinary provisions has not been further extended by the Italian legislator and, therefore, do not apply to any quotaholders loan granted after December 31, 2020. _Certain limitations on enforcement_ The enforcement of guarantees by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees granted by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Italy” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni _corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not_ perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; 244 ----- - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di _applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may_ be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, also taking into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the 245 ----- relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law No. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares. 246 ----- In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw- back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Such enforcement is subject to, inter alios, the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish Courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley _1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamento Civil) regarding remedies and enforcement measures_ available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act and other principles of law of general application. In this regard, prospective investors should note and analyze with their own legal advisors any such potential limitations including without limitation the following matters: (i) Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. In particular, Article 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code provides that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de _intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed._ Spanish Courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance. There is doubt as to the enforceability of punitive damages in Spain. 247 ----- (ii) Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of Spain. (iii) Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties. (iv) Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, permits Spanish courts to preclude early termination of an agreement if the basis of the breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements or the perfection and continuance of the relevant security interests and guarantees), and allows Spanish courts not to enforce any such early termination because of the relevant obligor’s breach of those ancillary, complementary or non-essential undertakings. (v) Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply. (vi) A Spanish Court may award damages if the specific performance of an obligation is deemed impracticable. (vii) A specific performance obligation may not automatically convert in a damages claim. (viii) A Spanish Court may modify the obligations deriving from contracts in the terms considered necessary in order to restore the balance between the obligations, if unexpected and exceptional circumstances, which were unforeseeable when the contracts were executed. (ix) In accordance with the general principles of Spanish Civil Procedural laws, the rules of evidence in any judicial proceeding cannot be modified by agreement of the parties. Accordingly, provisions in an agreement in which determinations by a party are to be deemed to be conclusive would not be upheld by a Spanish court. A determination, designation, calculation or certificate from one party as to any matter provided in the Notes documents might, in certain circumstances, be held by a Spanish court not to be final, conclusive and binding, if it could be shown to have an unreasonable or arbitrary basis or in the event of manifest error despite any provision in the secured documents to the contrary; (x) It may not be disregarded that the enforcement of a Guarantee granted by a Spanish Guarantor could require a judgment to be previously rendered in New York declaring the default or acceleration of the secured obligations and the amount due and payable thereunder; (xi) A certified translation into Spanish by an official translator of any document not executed in Spanish will be required to make such document admissible in evidence before any court in Spain; 248 ----- (xii) Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred or may be or become subject to the defenses of set-off or counterclaim, abuse of rights (abuso de _derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances,_ undue influence, duress or error. _Limitations on Guarantees_ The figure of a first demand guarantee has been admitted in several judgments by the Spanish Supreme Court as an autonomous guarantee, detached from the underlying agreement whose obligations are being guaranteed, acknowledging therefore the validity of the provision pursuant to which the guarantor has renounced to call on exceptions different to those arising from the guarantee. Notwithstanding this, case law has also admitted the possibility that the guarantor objects to the beneficiary of the guarantee the exception of fraud, bad faith or abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the events where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or with bad faith. Besides, case law has also admitted that the guarantor can stay the enforcement by showing that there has been no event of default (the guarantor bearing the burden of proof). _Corporate benefit_ Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of “corporate benefit” expressly regulated under the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, However, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent company and/or other companies of its group for the purposes of Article 226 of the Spanish Insolvency Act (i.e. rescission or claw-back of these actions during the 2-year hardening period, as described above), when the obligations guaranteed do not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee. Certain decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of such guarantees to the extent evidence can be given that amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the guarantee or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company under a intercompany loan agreement, equity contribution or similar arrangement, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to which such company belongs and the granting of parent guarantees, indemnities and comfort letters for which the relevant company obtains most favorable economic and financial conditions under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in accordance with Spanish case law existing as for the construction of the concept of “compensatory advantage” (“ventaja _compensatoria”)._ However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an insolvency scenario where the claims of the holders of the Notes, particularly as “special privilege claims” may be challenged if the insolvency administrator or other creditors may allege that such corporate benefit did not exist. _Limitation on claims_ Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (5 years being the general term established for obligations _in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code, as amended in 2015) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. 249 ----- _Court enforceability_ The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de _derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue_ influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim. _Financial assistance_ Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades _anónimas) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or_ indirect parent company, and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades de _responsabilidad limitada), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of_ any member of their corporate group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.5,Guarantors”).,206.5.1,,"There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and/or guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee and/or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event of the onset of an English Guarantor’s English law insolvency proceedings within any of the requisite time periods set forth below, the relevant Guarantee will not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Transaction at an undervalue_ 250 ----- Under the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) (the “Insolvency Act”), a liquidator or administrator of an English company can apply to the court for an order to set aside a guarantee (or grant other relief) if such liquidator or administrator believes that the grant of such guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It can only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the English company’s insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if it involves the company making a gift to a person, the company receiving no consideration or the company receiving consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into, which may include reducing payments under the Notes or setting aside the Guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable ot pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. _Preference_ Under the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of an English company can apply to the court for an order to set aside the grant of a guarantee (or grant other relief) if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such guarantee constituted a preference. It can only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company grants the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the Notes or setting aside the Guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any 251 ----- obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. However, for the court to determine that a transaction is a preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. This is a subjective test. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. _Transaction defrauding creditors_ Under the Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was entered into at an undervalue and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or to otherwise prejudice the interests of a person in relation to a claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration), and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators or to companies that are in liquidation or administration. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English Guarantor up to three years before the day on which the English Guarantor in the period entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. _Foreign currency_ 252 ----- Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pound sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in the event that an English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate. _Post-petition interest_ Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees in respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable by the Noteholders from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the proceedings of the relevant English Guarantor and accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of the commencement of the proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries. _Limitation on enforcement_ The grant of a Guarantee by an English Guarantor in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Guarantor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Guarantor in question with respect to its entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Guarantor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable”. Guarantees granted by the English Guarantors may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Regulation No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast) (the “Insolvency Regulation”), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018, was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 2015 and applies to insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). The Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” or “COMI.” The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the centre of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the centre of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in another Member State than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and the centre of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous Insolvency Regulation ((EC) 1346/2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration when determining the centre of main interests a number of factors, in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. If the centre of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. If the centre of main interests of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Secondary and territorial proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in 254 ----- Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to request the opening of such proceedings under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _Lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction_ for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant Member State so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets 255 ----- of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The Insolvency Regulation also provides for rules to coordinate main, secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings (Articles 41 et seq.), as well as to coordinate cross-border group insolvencies (Article 56 et seq.). In the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group are opened, insolvency practitioners and courts shall cooperate with any other insolvency practitioner and any other court involved in insolvency proceedings of another member of the group (Articles 56 and 57). The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies in one or more Member States (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and 256 ----- adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors. _EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_ The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019. The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or overindebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. 257 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.6,Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,206.6.2,France,"_Temporary measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic_ Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain temporary measures have recently been enacted by the French Government to adapt French insolvency law to the health crisis (Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, Ordinance No. 2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 (see article 124)). In particular, until December 31, 2021, pursuant to Article 1 of Ordinance n° 2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020, in force as from November 26, 2020, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation proceedings may be extended one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a maximum of ten months (see “—Conciliation _Proceedings” below)._ In addition, Article 124 of Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020 extends until December 31, 2021 the following measures that were initially adopted by Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, in force as from May 21, 2020 that were due to expire on December 31, 2020: - additional specific measures aimed at protecting debtors and an adaptation of the provisions governing grace periods in the context of conciliation proceedings (see “— _Conciliation Proceedings” and “—Grace Periods” below);_ - the loosening of the conditions for eligibility to accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see “—Accelerated Safeguard _Proceedings” below);_ the supervising judge’s right, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’ representative, to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement proposal the deadline during which creditors can respond to a debt settlement proposal in the context of a standard consultation for the approval of a safeguard or reorganization plan (see “—Adoption of the Safeguard or Reorganization Plan” below); the possible up to two year extension of the duration of the safeguard or reorganization plan, as a result of which such a plan can now last up to 12 years (see “—Adoption of the Safeguard _or Reorganization Plan” below); and_ the grant of a special privilege for creditors that make new cash contributions to the debtor during the safeguard proceedings, the accelerated safeguard proceedings, the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings or the reorganization Proceedings in order to ensure the continuation of the company’s business and its survival and for those who undertake to make such contribution for the execution of the safeguard or reorganization plan ordered or modified by the court (the “S/R Lien”). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may be put in place within the following weeks or months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law. _Grace periods_ In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil). Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into 258 ----- account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi- annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted Proceedings” below). _Warning procedure (procédure d’alerte)_ In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for certain warning procedures, which take place in stages. If a company is incorporated as a société anonyme, when there are elements which the statutory auditor of the company believes place the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, it must request company management to provide an explanation for the situation (Stage 1 of the warning procedure). Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures by management within 15 days following the request, the statutory auditor must request that the board of directors (or the equivalent body) be convened and may request to be heard by the president of the relevant commercial court (Stage 2 of the warning procedure). The minutes of the board of directors’ meeting are sent to the employee representatives during Stage 2, as Stage 1 proceedings are confidential. If, despite of the statutory auditor’s request, the board of directors (or an equivalent body) has not been convened, if the statutory auditor has not been summoned to the meeting of the board, or if the statutory auditor concludes that in the context of this meeting satisfactory explanations have not been given and appropriate corrective measures have not been not taken by management, then management must convene a shareholders’ meeting at which the auditors present a special report on the state of the company. This report is also sent to the employee representatives (Stage 3 of the warning procedure). In practice, the statutory auditor commonly invites the management to convene a shareholders’ meeting. If management fails to act, then the statutory auditor convenes the shareholders’ meeting himself/herself and sets the agenda. If the statutory auditor considers that decisions made by the shareholders during the shareholders’ meeting do not ensure the company’s existence as a going concern, he or she must inform the president of the relevant commercial court of the warning procedure and may also request to be heard on the matter (Stage 4 of the warning procedure). Similar warning procedures exist for companies not registered as a _société anonyme, with minor differences in technical details of the procedure. Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee, or, in their absence, the employees’ representatives have similar rights. The president of the relevant commercial court can also summon the management to provide explanations on elements which he or she believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, or when the company has not filed its financial statements within the statutory timeframe, despite his injunction. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the public health state of emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020596 dated May 20, 2020, as amended by Law No. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 (see 259 ----- article 124), have amended the warning procedure to provide that, until and including December 31, 2021, if the statutory auditor considers the state of the relevant company to require immediate action, and has determined that the director is refusing to take such action or is taking insufficient measures, the statutory auditors may inform the president of the relevant commercial court concurrently with his or her initial report made to the director, the chairman of the board of directors (conseil d’administration) or of the supervisory board (conseil de surveillance), as the case may be. In such case, the statutory auditor may communicate by any means and without delay to the president of the court his or her findings and proceedings, and may produce copies of any relevant documents. The statutory auditor is released from his or her obligation of professional secrecy towards the president of the relevant commercial court under these circumstances. This exceptional procedure does not preclude the application of the ordinary warning procedure detailed above. _Insolvency test_ Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria. The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see below). _Court-assisted Proceedings_ A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g. an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. _Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In_ practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad _hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed_ officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the _mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints such officer, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. 260 ----- Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “— _Insolvency test” above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The_ proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. Pursuant to Article 1 of Ordinance n° 2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force as from November 26, 2020, until December 31, 2021, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation proceedings commenced up to and including December 31, 2021 may be extended, one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court up to a maximum of ten months. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation _judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to_ Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 of May 20, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-1443 of November 25, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 (see article 124) have, in addition to their duration (see above), further modified conciliation proceedings to provide that, until December 31, 2021: - if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer payment of such creditor’s claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings: o the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment default; o the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor; or 261 ----- o the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim for the duration of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace _periods” above) even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit_ for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of such creditor’s claim. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the nonsignatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition: - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court; - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain precommencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted nor written off, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate); - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and 262 ----- - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency test” above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below under “—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and _liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than_ the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force: - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; - in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and - a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors that is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (Prepack sale—plan de cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor. 263 ----- As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. _Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_ A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. However, they may still challenge the opening judgment provided certain criteria are met. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a courtappointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The courtappointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing such administrator, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de _surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire)_ and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business require the prior approval of the supervisory judge. Granting security interests or settling disputes also require the prior approval of the supervisory judge. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état _de cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the_ administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: 264 ----- - the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor except in the case of (i) (b); - the court may not act upon its own initiative, except in the case of (i) (b); and - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller (“contrôleurs”) (if any), the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). In case of (i)(b) only, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request of the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the State Prosecutor if the draft plan was not approved by the relevant creditors’ committees and, if any, the bondholders’ general meeting or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances. As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 (see article 124) modified safeguard proceedings to provide that: - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created, applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The S/R Lien is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted, with the approval of the supervisory judge, after commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period. - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person: o during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the supervisory judge, or o for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts. - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over precommencement and post- commencement claims except with respect to (i) employees’ super-privilege claims, (ii) procedural costs and the New Money Lien, (iii) pre-commencement claims secured by real estate security interest (in judicial liquidation proceedings only) and (iv) post-commencement wages claims not advanced by the French wages fund under provisions of article L.3253-8 to article L.3253-13 of the French Labor Code, in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. - Such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors. Once safeguard proceedings have been ordered, there will be and automatic stay applicable to certain claims. Payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the 265 ----- purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the supervisory judge can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less unless, upon their or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the courtappointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until December 31, 2021, the abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the court-appointed creditors’ representative. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual 266 ----- instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. Pursuant to Article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 until December 31, 2021, the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses: - this extension does not require to go through the process of the substantial modification of the plan (modification substantielle du plan); and - the payment instalment deadlines initially set by the president of the court or the court would be adapted to the duration of the plan so extended, with possible deviation from the provisions of Article L. 626-8 (including the obligation to pay an annual instalment of 5% minimum as from year 3) and application of grace periods provisions within the limit of the new term of the plan so extended. Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million), or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees that are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (or their successors or assignees of a claim acquired from a supplier) (the “credit institutions committee”); and - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations. As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or the bondholders general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or the bondholders general meeting. The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and 267 ----- - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debtfor-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). The creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting will be consulted on the safeguard plan drafted by the debtor’s management together with the judicial administrator during the observation period. Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan. The_ committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court- appointed administrator. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. The same rules as set forth in the paragraph above apply to the bondholders general meeting. Creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted do not take part in the vote at the creditors’ committees or the bondholders general meeting. The rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders shall be determined in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above. Creditors secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by a debtor are not members of the creditors’ committees and are consulted in accordance with such standard consultation process. Once the treatment of the creditors has been determined, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the 268 ----- observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. _Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_ A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings which is able to reach a conciliation agreement (supported by creditors representing a significant amount of its claims without being able to reach an unanimous agreement) may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) enabling it to implement a restructuring plan in an expedite fashion through the vote of its creditors gathered in creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting (where applicable) at a twothird majority. The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track” the treatment of difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those: - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or - whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and who have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT) or whose aggregate balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million. However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision. 269 ----- To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committee- based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. 270 ----- The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below). _Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_ Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the State prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), the partial or total sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed 271 ----- administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—Court_administered Proceedings— Safeguard”). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a court officer (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the courtappointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the forced sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other 272 ----- shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is offered usually at a significant discount compared to their in bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the business as a going concern, and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: o a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; and o only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent it from being transferred) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless reaching an agreement with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are 273 ----- located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their in bonis market value; - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (a) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); (b) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (c) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure _des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is_ questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts_ received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. _The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_ The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of 274 ----- the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred (including a security to secure a guarantee obligation previously granted), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.” There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (assuming the proceedings are successful). _Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_ Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default (even prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings), but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date 275 ----- of the court decision adopting the sale plan (plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings (during the observation period only with respect to judicial reorganization proceedings)) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: o to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); o to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor prior to the decision of the court-appointed administrator to continue the ongoingcontract; or o to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the Insolvency Regulation (provided no secondary proceedings are commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where 276 ----- the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”).In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post- commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation 277 ----- proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset. _Creditors’ Liability_ Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, or (ii) manifestly interfered with the management of the debtor or (iii) obtained security or guarantees that are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. 278 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.6,Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,206.6.3,Italy,"The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency”, hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. The main provisions set out in the Insolvency Code were expected to come into force 18 months after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale (i.e., on August 15, 2020). However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been currently postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the Liquidity Decree. Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 as amended (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), as in force before. Therefore, the main provisions set out in the Insolvency Code are not yet in force and practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot be foreseen. In addition, significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 27, 2015 through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”) which entered into force in June 2015 and has been converted into law by the Italian Law No. 132/2015 (“Law 132/2015”), entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the 279 ----- adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined by Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent and not a temporary status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy tools are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento attestato) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di _risanamento attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and_ to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. 280 ----- The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions (pursuant to Article 217-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debts outstanding, subject to the court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court (omologazione), in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due or, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among other things, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the debtor to supply the creditors with the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium. At such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement and the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for granting such moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 281 ----- 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame of 60 days, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and nonadhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of nonparticipating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the nonparticipating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith and (ii) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting financial creditors have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from blocking restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it, through the filing of an objection (opposizione) within 30 days of receipt of the application. In no case may the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter alia, the performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of nonfinancial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) (concordato preventivo) enjoys priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority 282 ----- status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness via in rem security (garanzie reali) or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financial indebtedness aims to provide a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. _Court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such 283 ----- publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità_ aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the _concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides that the debtor company which has been granted such extension by the court, can, before the deadline, request for a further extension of up to 90 days, even if it has filed an appeal for a declaration of bankruptcy. The petition requesting the extension provides for the reasons that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The petition may be filed by the debtor who has been granted the hearing referred to in Article 182-bis, paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The court, in closed session, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed) and without following the requirements set out in Article 182-bis, paragraph 7 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds and that the conditions for reaching a debt restructuring agreement with the majorities referred to in Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are satisfied . In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to oversee the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the 284 ----- creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its nonrecurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments, guarantees and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arises out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the windingup of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. 285 ----- If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice _delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the_ company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest—as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders—to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of the concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). 286 ----- In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a prebankruptcy agreement proposal with a liquidation purpose (concordato _liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to_ the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening of a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the _concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora _ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded_ from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro _subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements_ (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the _concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice _delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s_ request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree extended by six months the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020. In the procedures for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), that are still pending before the court on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato _preventivo in the course of which a meeting of creditors was already held but for which the_ majorities according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law were not reached. 287 ----- _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori _commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding_ fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank _pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before, for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of the creditors and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include 288 ----- real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **_Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the _concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The _concordato _fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors_ holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - **_Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing), claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and the claims for employee wages. Under certain circumstances, claims of preferential creditors might include claims of certain entities and/or financial institutions providing credit support for economic development of companies in the form of, among others, financial guarantees to facilitate companies’ access to credit, due to Italian law provisions providing that, subject to certain conditions and save for certain exceptions, should a guarantee issued by certain guarantee’s providers be enforced by the companies’ direct creditors and the relevant guarantee’s provider exercise its right of subrogation arising therefrom, the claims of such guarantee’s provider towards the company may be given a preference in payment (including in respect of proceeds from enforcement of security interest); applicable Italian law provisions relating to the possible preferential treatment of the abovementioned claims are largely untested in the Italian courts and, therefore, it is uncertain whether and to 289 ----- what extent any priority would be assigned by a court to such claims. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori _privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively,_ provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law indeed creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. - **_Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of guarantees or security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner. Acts ineffective by operation of law. - Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and - Under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Acts that may be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner. - The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of 290 ----- the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: o onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; o payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; o pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and o pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. - The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or the transaction: o payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and o granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. - The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: o payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; o a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; o the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; o transactions entered into and payments made with respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di risanamento attestato; 291 ----- o transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security interests granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; o a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security granted in the context of “concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and transactions entered into, and payments made after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo; o remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and o payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser. Finally, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. _Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ The extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an 292 ----- extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases, a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submits a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include an arrangement with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from the submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however’ should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. _Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those arising from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ 293 ----- A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Interim financing_ The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato _preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the expert_ certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among other things, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and that the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status (prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall_ restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status. _Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_ In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor enters into insolvency proceedings, any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the noninsolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to transactions made by 294 ----- the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new guarantee or security granted with respect to preexisting debts not yet due at the time the guarantee or security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length, guarantee or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Italian Guarantor’s Guarantee. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of a guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Guarantee. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union, as well as within the United Kingdom with respect to insolvency proceedings opened before December 31, 2020, the end of the “implementation period” under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement signed on January 24, 2020 between the United Kingdom and the European Union.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

As a general rule and in accordance with the rules on determination of the COMI summarized in the section above, in the event of an insolvency of the Spanish Guarantors, insolvency proceedings shall be initiated in Spain and governed by Spanish law. The Legislative Royal Decree 1/2020, of 5 May, approving the (Real Decreto Legislativo _1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal), which_ repealed the Act 22/2003 of 9 July, on Insolvency (Ley 22/2003, de 9 de julio, Concursal), as amended (the “Spanish Insolvency Act”) regulates pre-insolvency and court insolvency proceedings, as opposed to out-of-court liquidation, which is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities. The insolvency proceedings, which are called concurso de acreedores, are applicable to all persons and legal entities, except for public entities. These proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business or to the liquidation of the assets of the debtor. The insolvency laws of Spain may differ from the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions to which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Spain. 295 ----- Prospective investors should note that that Spanish Insolvency Act originally regulated by Law 22/2003 underwent various reforms and amendments since first published in 2003. The Spanish Government has approved in 2020 the latest recasting, in force as from September 1, 2020, in order not only to incorporate all these amendments but also to clarify and harmonize certain questions raised by the courts and the doctrine since its first application by Spanish courts, however, it should be noted that certain matters are still be subject to different views and different interpretations by the relevant insolvency courts from time to time. The entry into force of Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, implies that Spain will have two years as of such date for the transposition of such Directive into Spanish regulations. This transposition process may lead to the approval of certain amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transposition process has not been initiated yet and, therefore, it is still uncertain how this Directive will affect the Spanish Insolvency Act. In addition, due to the health crisis generated by the COVID-19, on March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared a State of Alarm (Estado de Alarma) in Spain from March 14 to June 8, 2020 and, from that date, the Spanish Government has enacted certain Royal Decree Laws that temporarily amend certain provisions of the Spanish insolvency regime, as further described below. Moreover, future changes, amendments or restatements of the Spanish Insolvency Act cannot be disregarded either. _Concept and Petition for Insolvency_ In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered when a debtor is deemed insolvent, which means either (i) when a debtor becomes unable to regularly meet its obligations as they become due and payable (“current insolvency” or insolvencia actual); or (ii) when a debtor expects that it will shortly be unable to do so (“imminent insolvency” or _insolvencia _inminente). Insolvency proceedings are available as a type of legal protection that a debtor_ may request in order to avoid the attachment of its assets by its creditors. A petition for insolvency (solicitud de declaración de concurso) may be initiated: (a) by the debtor (in the case of a company, by decision of its directors), in which case the insolvency proceedings are considered as “voluntary insolvency” (concurso _voluntario); or_ (b) by any creditor, provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the filing of the petition for insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature, or by certain other interested third parties, in which case the insolvency proceedings are considered as “mandatory insolvency” (concurso necesario). Notwithstanding, only the debtor may file a petition for insolvency on the basis of its imminent insolvency. As described in further detail below, the Spanish Insolvency Act provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the court confirmation of a creditors’ composition agreement for a reorganization or convenio (the “Reorganization Plan” or “Convenio”), or the liquidation of the debtor’s estate (the “Liquidation”). An insolvency proceeding can also conclude (i) at any moment when it is verified that there are insufficient assets to pay post insolvency debt, (ii) at any moment when it is verified that all of the credits have been paid, or the situation of insolvency does no longer exist, or (iii) when it is verified that all of the creditors have waived their credit rights. 296 ----- _Voluntary insolvency (concurso voluntario)_ Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the relevant debtor. As a general rule, the debtor must file a petition for insolvency within two (2) months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for necessary insolvency occur. Failure to file a petition for insolvency within the statutory 2-month period impedes the debtor to propose a pre-arranged Reorganization Plan and directors might be held personally liable in the event of liquidation for the impaired claims accrued as from the onset of insolvency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this general rule of the debtors’ duty to file for insolvency within the referred 2-month period does not apply if the debtor notifies to the relevant court the initiation of negotiations with its creditors to reach (i) a pre-arranged Reorganization Plan (propuesta de convenio anticipado); (ii) an out-of-court workout (acuerdo de refinanciación) set out in Article 598 of the Spanish Insolvency Act; or (iii) a collective out-of-court repayment agreement (acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) under Articles 631 _et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act (the “Creditors’ Negotiations Communication”). If the debtor files with the relevant court a Creditors’ Negotiation Communication, on top of the aforesaid 2-month general term, the debtor gains an additional 3-month period to achieve an agreement with its creditors regarding a pre-arranged Reorganization Plan, an out-of-court workout or an out-of-court repayment agreement, plus one (1) further month to file for insolvency, unless it has overcome insolvency. During this 3-month period, creditors’ petitions for necessary insolvency will not be accepted. Likewise, this Creditors’ Negotiation Communication prevents the commencement of court or out-of- court enforcement actions, and/or suspends (as applicable) existing enforcement actions, over assets or rights integrated in the debtor’s estate (patrimonio del deudor) or demanding seizure of assets or rights deemed necessary for the company’s business operations (other than those arising from public law claims) during the abovementioned additional 3-month period. In addition, enforcement proceedings that have been brought by creditors holding financial claims shall be prohibited or suspended (as applicable) provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to enter into a collective refinancing agreement (acuerdo de refinanciación _colectivo) set out in Articles 597 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act (a “Refinancing_",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.7,Agreement”); and have expressly agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings,206.7.1,England and Wales,"_Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts_ While the United Kingdom was a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the United Kingdom were subject to both EU and applicable United Kingdom domestic legislation. Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU on 31 January 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on 31 December 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the United Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into United Kingdom domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the United Kingdom, including the Insolvency Regulation 2000 and the Insolvency Regulation, and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act, the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Guarantor has its COMI in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Guarantor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is defined in the same way as under the Insolvency Regulation (see “European Union” above). While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below). Any insolvency proceedings by or against an English Guarantor would likely be based on English insolvency laws. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an English Guarantor. The principal sources of English insolvency laws are the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules. In addition, the Companies Act 2006 sets out statutory procedures which can be utilized to effect a compromise, or other arrangement, between a company and its creditors and/or members. Recent reforms to the English insolvency and restructuring regime were introduced 313 ----- by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act (the “CIG Act”), which came into force on June 26, 2020. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency and restructuring laws relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees granted by the English Guarantors. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under such Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Guarantor. _Administration_ English insolvency laws empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge where the floating charge has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. Alternatively the court may make an administration order upon an application to the court by the company, its directors or one or more creditors if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 for a period of 3 weeks after receipt of the statutory demand at the company’s registered office or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential creditors. During the administration, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor and no security interest over any of the company’s property (save for eligible arrangements under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.7,Agreement”); and have expressly agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings,206.7.2,,"against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating. Nevertheless, secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the relevant secured assets, though once the proceedings have been initiated, such enforcement proceedings shall be immediately suspended. In any event, financial collateral and security interests over collateral located outside of Spain should not in principle be affected by the Creditors’ Negotiation Communication automatic stay of proceedings. _Mandatory insolvency (concurso necesario)_ Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a creditor and, in certain cases, the insolvency mediator (mediador concursal). In accordance with Article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, a creditor can seek a declaration of insolvency of its debtor if (i) such creditor can prove it is not possible to attach any assets, 297 ----- or sufficient assets of the debtor, to pay the amount owed; or (ii) evidences before court a final previous judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency; or (iii) there is a generalized default on payments by such debtor; (iv) there is a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of such debtor’s assets; (v) there is a misplacement, “fire sale” or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (vi) there is a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e. three months). Upon receipt of an insolvency petition by the entitled party, the court may issue interim measures to protect the assets of the relevant debtor and may request a guarantee from the petitioning creditor asking for the adoption of such measures to cover damages caused by the preliminary protective measures. The relevant debtor may challenge the necessary insolvency petition, for which it will have to prove that it is not insolvent, unless the creditor’s insolvency petition is based on (i) the evidence of a final previous judicial or administrative final declaration of insolvency; (ii) the failure to seize sufficient assets of the debtor to pay the amounts owed; or (iii) the seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of such debtor’s assets, where the Insolvency Court will hand down an order declaring the opening of the insolvency proceeding without hearing the debtor. In this case, the Insolvency Court will summon the parties to a hearing and will finally render a court ruling either dismissing the application filed by the creditor or declaring insolvency. The Spanish Board of Ministers approved on April 28, 2020 the Royal Decree-Law 16/2020 which provides that, until December 31, 2021, debtors are released from their obligation to file for insolvency and insolvency judges will not process any creditor’s insolvency request that is filed prior to that date. Due also to certain COVID-19 related measures, the 2020 year-end corporate results will not be taken into account for the purposes of determining if a company is under mandatory dissolution cause. However, if 2021 financial year results show losses that reduce the net equity (patrimonio neto) below half of the share capital, the General Shareholders’ Meeting must be convened by the directors or at the request of any shareholder within two months from financial year-end, in order to wind up and liquidate the company, unless the share capital is sufficiently increased or reduced. _Request of coordinated insolvency_ The insolvency of a company that forms part of a group of companies, including the parent company, does not automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the group. As stated above, a company is insolvent when it cannot regularly meet its payment obligations as they fall due. Notwithstanding the above, creditors may apply for a coordinated insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors (acumulación de concursos) if either: (a) the assets are commingled, or (b) such debtors form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the coordinated insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Coordinated insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same group. Any of the insolvent debtors or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural coordination of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of 298 ----- companies). Moreover, creditors may apply for the procedural coordination of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (a) the assets are commingled, or (b) they pertain to the same group of companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator pursuant to Article 41 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. It is important to note that coordinated insolvency proceedings do not entail substantive consolidation. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a financial claim shall be subordinated). The current system that the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for is basically a procedural one, which is aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost-efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, for the purpose of drafting the insolvency report, by the insolvency administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the insolvent companies may be consolidated where the estates and liabilities are so commingled, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay. _Certain effects of insolvency_ Effects for the debtor As a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, in a voluntary insolvency (concurso _voluntario) the debtor retains its powers to manage and dispose of its business, but is subject_ to the supervision of the insolvency administrator (“administración concursal”) (the “Insolvency Administrator”) appointed by the competent Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo _Mercantil) dealing with the insolvency proceedings (the “Insolvency Court”)._ In contrast, in the case of mandatory insolvency (concurso necesario), as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and management powers (including the power to dispose of assets) are conferred solely upon the Insolvency Administrator. However, the Insolvency Court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the Insolvency Administrator request, the Insolvency Court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor in breach of any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be declared null and void unless ratified by the Insolvency Administrator. Subject to certain exceptions linked to the maintenance and conservation of the debtor’s estate, the debtor shall not sell or create security over its rights and assets without the Insolvency Court’s authorization until the approval of the Reorganization Plan with the creditors or the opening of the liquidation phase. Effects on contracts As explained in further detail below, one of the main general principles underlying the Spanish insolvency regime is that of “no termination effect” or continuity of all contracts to which the insolvent debtor is party. In accordance with Article 157 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, all clauses in contracts with reciprocal obligations that allow any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other 299 ----- party’s insolvency declaration (ipso facto clauses) are deemed as not included in the agreement and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e. agency laws or Royal Decree Law 5/2005, applicable to financial collateral, as defined therein). Any provision to the contrary will be null and void. Insolvency declaration does not hinder the effectiveness of contracts with reciprocal obligations pending on performance by both the insolvent party and the counterparty (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate (administrative expense—post-insolvency credits that are pre-deductible from the debtor’s estate—créditos contra la masa, as further explained below). However, upon post- petition breaches, the Insolvency Court can terminate any such contracts at the request of the non-breaching party of the agreement or declare the continuation of the executory contract based on the “insolvency proceeding´s best interest” (mantenimiento del _contrato en interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party’s claim will be_ considered as a post-insolvency credit (pre-deductible from the debtor’s estate, créditos contra _la masa)._ On the other hand, the Insolvency Administrator (together with the insolvent debtor or by its sole discretion if debtor’s powers to manage and dispose of its business have been conferred to the Insolvency Administrator) may request the Insolvency Court to early terminate the executory contract in the interest of the insolvent debtor’s estate (resolución del contrato en _interés del concurso). The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor_ having to return and indemnify damages to its counterpart against the insolvency estate (con _cargo a la masa). In the event that debtor, the Insolvency Administrator and the counterparty_ agree on the termination and its effects, the Insolvency Court will approve the parties’ agreement; otherwise, if the Insolvency Court upholds termination, it will also fix the damages claim to be received by the non-breaching party. Furthermore, insolvency declaration stays the accrual of interest amounts under the relevant agreements, except for: (i) credit rights secured with an in rem right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security interest as such value is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act (i.e. 90% of the collateral fair value minus senior claims), and (ii) any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the Act of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado) in force at that time. Effects on enforcement proceedings As a general rule, the initiation of insolvency proceedings stays enforcement actions. In particular, the enforcement of any in rem security interest over those assets or rights that are deemed by the Insolvency Court as necessary to the continuation of the debtor’s commercial or professional activity, or to a business unit of the insolvent company, cannot be commenced (and the procedures already initiated before insolvency declaration shall be suspended) until the earlier of: (i) approval of a Reorganization Plan or Convenio provided that such Reorganization Plan does not affect such right; or (ii) one (1) year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation phase under the insolvency proceedings being initiated. This stay of enforcement proceedings will only be lifted when the Insolvency Court determines that the assets or rights is not considered necessary for the debtor to continue its professional or business activities, or when any of the aforementioned scenarios occur. 300 ----- When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, Spanish courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights. Nevertheless, shares (either acciones or participaciones sociales) held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares does not bring about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset. Moreover, as a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings that can have an effect on the estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral, as defined in RDL 5/2005). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Act extends the jurisdiction of the Insolvency Court, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law). Finally, prospective investors should also note that enforcement of any security interests will be subject to the provisions of Spanish Civil Procedure Act and Spanish Insolvency Act (where applicable), which may entail delays in the enforcement. Ranking of creditors’ credits and claims The court decision issued by the competent Insolvency Court declaring the opening of insolvency proceedings for a particular debtor (auto de declaración de concurso) shall contain an express request for the creditors (i) to declare those debts owed to them within the period of one (1) month period as from the day after the publication of the insolvency proceedings in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado), and (ii) to provide the Insolvency Administrator with the relevant documentation to justify such credits. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and that is held by the debtor, the Insolvency Administrator shall draw up an inventory and a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classify them according to the categories that the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for and that are summarized below. In accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Act, creditors’ claims are classified in two main groups: (i) post-insolvency credits/estate claims (créditos contra la masa); and (ii) insolvency claims (créditos concursales). Post-insolvency credits/estate claims (créditos contra la masa) Article 251 of the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for the so-called “estate claims” (créditos _contra la masa) which main feature is that these are pre-deductible (i.e. when they become_ due and payable) claims from the insolvent debtor’s estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security). Debt against the insolvent debtor’s estate includes, among others: (a) certain amounts of the employee payroll; (b) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings; 301 ----- (c) debtor’s liabilities under executory contracts and those deriving from damages claim obligations to return arising out of termination for breach, assumption or rejection of executory contracts; (d) those debts that derive from the exercise of a clawback action within insolvency of bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith); (e) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or tort liability of the insolvent debtor after insolvency declaration and until its conclusion; (f) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the date of the insolvency declaration; (g) insolvency administrator’s fees; (h) in case of liquidation, the financing granted to the debtor r before the opening of the liquidation phase to finance the viability plan for the execution of a Reorganization Plan in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Act; (i) 50% of the new funds (i.e. fresh money) lent under a Refinancing Agreement or a court sanctioned refinancing agreement set out in Articles 605 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act (“Homologated Refinancing Agreement”), which also contemplates a debt-for-equity swap executed before the granting of those new funds. However, this benefit shall not apply to the new funds lent by the debtor or by specially related parties (personas especialmente relacionadas) of the debtor resulting from a share capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose. These post-insolvency claims are deemed “super-senior” in the sense that they are not subject to ranking or acknowledgement and, in principle, must be paid as and when they fall due; therefore, these claims are preferred to all others, except for proceeds from collateral subject to specially privileged claims (as described below). Insolvency claims (créditos concursales) Insolvency claims are classified in the following categories: (a) **Specially privileged claims (créditos con privilegio especial): Those creditors benefiting from security interests created by the insolvent debtor over certain assets (i.e. _in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security interests calculated in accordance with the rules set out in Article 275 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, i.e. 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset minus those claims that hold higher ranking security over such asset, provided that such security interest is listed in the creditors’ list. The portion of the claim of a secured creditor exceeding the value of the relevant security interests calculated as per the above will be classified according to the nature of the claim (usually, ordinary or subordinated claims). These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one (1) year and certain additional limitations that the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for. 302 ----- Specially-privileged creditors are not subject to the Reorganization Plan or Convenio_ unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the Reorganization Plan or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the workout measures envisaged under the Reorganization Plan) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such Reorganization Plan. In the event of liquidation, the specially-privileged creditors are the first to collect payment against the assets on which their credit are secured up to the value of the security interest. However, the Insolvency Administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the security interests and pay these claims as administrative expenses under specific payment rules. (b) **Generally privileged claims (créditos con privilegio general): Those creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among others, (a) specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities; (b) 50% of the claims held by the creditor who firstly filed for the insolvency of the debtor (excluding subordinated claims); and (c) 50% of the new funds under a Refinancing Agreement or a Homologated Refinancing Agreement. Similarly to specially-privileged creditors, these generally-privileged creditors are not subject to the Reorganization Plan or Convenio unless creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the workout measures envisaged under the Reorganization Plan) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such Reorganization Plan. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against assets other than those secured by a specially privileged claim after specially privileged creditors, in accordance with the ranking that the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for. (c) **Ordinary claims (créditos ordinarios): Ordinary creditors are all those creditors who have claims that are not classified as non-subordinated or non-privileged claims, and they shall be paid pro rata once the estate claims and both generally and specially privileged claims have been paid. (d) **Subordinated claims (créditos subordinados): Subordinated creditors is a category of claims that includes, among others: o credits communicated late (outside the specific 1-month period mentioned above); o credits which are contractually subordinated _vis-à-vis all other credits of the debtor; o credits relating to unpaid interest claims (including default interest), except for those credits secured with an in rem right up to the value of the security interest; o fines; and o claims of creditors which are “specially related parties” (personas _especialmente relacionadas) to the insolvent debtor, which is a category that_ is particularly noteworthy and can be summarized as follows: 303 ----- - In the case of individuals: any debtor’s relatives; legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives; the factual or legal administrators of such legal entities; any other legal entity forming part of the same group of companies and the legal entities in respect of which the people described in this paragraph are their factual and legal administrators. - In the case of a legal entity: – shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any special related party to these shareholders, as described herein); – limited liability shareholders holding directly or indirectly 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed or has securities listed in a secondary official market, as this would be the case for the Target) at the time the credit is originated; – directors (either de jure or de facto), insolvency liquidators, general managers holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held these positions during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration); and – companies belonging to the same group as the debtor and their respective shareholders provided that such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth above (i.e. 10% or 5% if the relevant company is listed). Furthermore, in the absence of proof to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned above are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Notwithstanding the above, those creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights pursuant to a Refinancing Agreement or an Homologated Refinancing Agreement (and who have even been appointed as directors) shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such Refinancing Agreement or an Homologated Refinancing Agreement. Subordinated creditors are “second-level” creditors. They do not have voting rights but are subject to the terms of the Reorganization Plan once ordinary claims are satisfied pursuant to the terms of such Reorganization Plan. Therefore, subordinated creditors have rather limited chances of collecting payment according to the ranking of claims that the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for. As an exception to this subordination regime, fresh money granted to the debtor pursuant to an out-of-court workout regulated under Articles 596 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act or an Homologated Refinancing Agreement, which also contemplates a debt-for-equity swap executed before the granting of such fresh money, shall not be classified as subordinated claim under Article 281.1.5.º of the Spanish Insolvency Act provided that the requirements set out in Article 283.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Act are met. This is an incentive to promote fresh money and debt-for-equity swaps in order to remove insolvency out-of-court.According 304 ----- to Royal Decree Law 16/2020, loans granted by specially related persons (personas _especialmente relacionadas) after the declaration of the State of Alarm (declared March 14,_ 2020) will rank (i) as estate claims in case of infringement of a composition agreement within the two years following the declaration of the State of Alarm (i.e. until March 14, 2022), and (ii) as ordinary claims in case of insolvency proceedings declared within two years following the declaration of the State of Alarm (i.e. until March 14, 2022). In this case, payment of ordinary or privileged claims made by a specially related person on behalf of the debtor will also rank as ordinary claims. No termination effects The Spanish Insolvency Act provides for the general principle of “no termination effect” as one of the cornerstones upon which the Spanish insolvency regime is built. According to this principle, all contracts and arrangements of the insolvent debtor remain effective at the time of the insolvency, which means that the declaration of insolvency by itself does not impair the existence and effectiveness of the agreements contracts entered into by the debtor Any contractual arrangements providing for the early termination of a contract with mutual obligations and/or entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will be unenforceable. As a general rule, the declaration of insolvency does not alter the general contractual rules on termination, but under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the Insolvency Court may decide to remedy an eventual default of the insolvent party by reinstating an agreement, with the effect that any outstanding amounts and further payments under the agreement will be post-insolvency claims (créditos contra la masa) with the effects summarized above. If the Insolvency Court deems it appropriate for the interests of the insolvent party, it is also entitled to terminate an agreement, with compensation for damages if it deems it is best for the insolvency proceeding. There are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which are dealt with by the insolvency judge. Hardening periods There is no clawback by operation of law, which means that there are no prior transactions by a debtor that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, but instead the Insolvency Administrator (or those creditors that have asked the Insolvency Administrator to do so in the absence of action by the Insolvency Administrator) must expressly challenge those transactions that are considered detrimental to the insolvent debtor’s estate by filing an action for rescission (acción de reintegración). In accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Act, in particular under Article 226 therein, upon insolvency declaration only those transactions that could be deemed detrimental to the insolvent debtor’s estate (perjuicio patrimonial) during the two (2) years prior to the date the insolvency is declared, may be challenged, even if there was no fraudulent intention. Moreover, subject to ordinary Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil) based actions, the Insolvency Administrator or any creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement provided that the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. The clawback period for this action is four (4) years. The Spanish Insolvency Act does not define the meaning of detrimental (perjuicio patrimonial). Detrimental does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest resulting in the damage to the insolvent debtor’s estate or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings (pars condition creditorum). 305 ----- Although such definition of detrimental does not exist, it is important to note that Articles 227 and 228 of the Spanish Insolvency Act provide for the following types of presumptions to determine whether it was detrimental to the insolvent debtor’s estate or not within the 2-year hardening period: (a) “irrebuttable presumptions” (iuris et de iure), which refer to any free disposals and to prepayment or cancellation of unsecured claims or obligations where the relevant maturity date(s) would have fall after the date on which the declaration of insolvency takes place; and (b) “rebuttable presumptions” (iuris tantum) that are subject to being contested by the other party, which include the following actions: - any disposals in favor of “specially related parties” (as described above); - the creation of _in rem security interests as collateral of previously existing obligations or of new obligations replacing existing ones (e.g. under a refinancing); and - the payment or other acts to terminate obligations being secured by an _in rem security interest and which mature after the date of declaration_ of insolvency. Ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out at arm’s length. Consequently, those acts that have been entered into by the relevant debtor may be rescinded if carried out during the 2-year hardening period and considered detrimental for such debtor’s estate. In particular, judges have considered detrimental payments made by an insolvent company prior to a declaration of insolvency, determining that in some situations a debtor could not be compelled to repay its obligations at the time of payment, because it was already unable to regularly pay debts as they came due. For this determination, there is no need of proving before the competent Insolvency Court the existence of actual or constructive fraud; it just must be proven that the relevant transaction was detrimental to the estate. The consequence of the Insolvency Court ruling for the rescission of a prejudicial act is that the parties involved in such transaction are required to return their reciprocal consideration with any accrued rents or interest and the guarantees and security interests are cancelled (concerning bilateral contracts, otherwise, the only party obliged to return is the non-insolvent one). Such claims are generally regarded as postinsolvency claims (créditos contra la masa) unless in case of bad faith by the relevant creditor, in which case its claims will be subordinated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Article 730 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, it is important to note that those acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be subject to clawback actions if such act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means and under any grounds whatsoever (i.e. not only in insolvency scenarios) under the relevant non-Spanish applicable laws. Procedurally, lenders can be sued, but the Spanish court should dismiss the clawback action on the merits if lenders prove (i) that the act or transaction at issue is subject to foreign law, and (ii) that such act or transaction is unavoidable under the circumstances pursuant to such foreign law. Neither Refinancing Agreements or Homologated Refinancing Agreements, nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any security interests created in the performance of such Refinancing Agreements or Homologated Refinancing Agreements, will 306 ----- be subject to an action for rescission, provided that such Refinancing Agreements or Homologated Refinancing Agreements, transactions, acts, payments or security interests comply with the requirements set out below under “—Cramdown effects of certain refinancing _agreements.”_ In the case that a Refinancing Agreement under Article 598 is not subject to the procedure of court approval or “homologation” (homologación) described therein, the relevant creditors party to such Refinancing Agreement may obtain certain (but not total) protection against clawback, provided that such refinancing agreement is endorsed by at least 3/5 (60%) of the total claims of the insolvent debtor (calculated on an individual and on a consolidated basis but excluding intragroup claims). Among other requirements, such Refinancing Agreement must be founded on a viability plan reflecting that the insolvent debtor will be viable in the short and medium term, and it must also comply with the rest of requirements explained below. Conclusion of insolvency _Composition with creditors by means of a Reorganization Plan_ Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Act encourages creditors to agree on a composition or reorganization plan regarding payment of the insolvency debts (i.e. the Reorganization Plan we referred to un previous sections). This Reorganization Plan may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors, and it shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, this Reorganization Plan must be honored by the debtor and respected by the creditors. The Reorganization Plan must contain proposals for write-offs (quitas) and/or stays (esperas). Article 317 of the Spanish Insolvency Act provides that it may also contain proposals for alternative or complementary measures for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for Public Law creditors), as permitted by any applicable law. The Reorganization Plan may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the Reorganization Plan. The Reorganization Plan may not include (i) any change in the amount of the debt, as determined by the Spanish Insolvency Act (without prejudice of any agreed write-offs (quitas) and/or stays (esperas)), (ii) any amendment of the credits classification, as set out in the Spanish Insolvency Act and (iii) the liquidation of the debtor’s state for the payment of the credits. The proposals in the Reorganization Plan must include a payment schedule. (a) In order for a Reorganization Plan to be approved by the creditors, the following majorities shall be met: - In case the Reorganization Plan includes: - write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims; - stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a period not exceeding 5 years; or - in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into PPLs over the same period at least 50% of the unsecured liabilities (i.e. ordinary credits) shall vote in favor of such Reorganization Plan. 307 ----- Notwithstanding the above, a simple majority (i.e. a portion of the unsecured liabilities voting in favor that exceeds the votes against) will suffice when the Reorganization Plan consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured claims within a period not exceeding 3 years, or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary unsecured claims applying a write-off of less than 20%. (b) In case the Reorganization Plan includes any other content different from the abovementioned, 65% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary credits) should have voted for the Reorganization Plan according Article 376 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are not entitled to vote. Although in principle secured creditors are not subject to an approved Reorganization Plan (unless they have expressly voted in its favor), the effects of an approved Reorganization Plan can be extended to secured and privileged creditors if the relevant Reorganization Plan is approved by the following majorities of creditors: (i) In case the Reorganization Plan includes a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than 5 years or conversion of debt into PPLs also for a period no longer than 5 years, at least 60% of privileged creditors of the same class (by value of their collateral as per the valuation rules that the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for) shall vote in favor; and (ii) In case the Reorganization Plan includes any other content different from the abovementioned, at least 75% of privileged creditors of the same class according to Article 397.2.2.º of the Spanish Insolvency Act (by value of their collateral as per the valuation rules that the Spanish Insolvency Act provides for) shall vote in favor. _Cramdown effects of Homologated Refinancing Agreements_ In order to seek protection against clawback, a refinancing agreement (i.e. an out-of-court workout) may be judicially approved or homologated (homologado) by the Commercial Court that will be competent to conduct an eventual insolvency proceeding of the relevant debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreement, if: (A) The refinancing agreement is entered into in the context of a viability plan that allows the continuity of the professional activity of the debtor in the short and medium term; (B) it entails a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the financial structure by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones; (C) it has been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (excluding from the calculation of such thresholds public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (D) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group of companies, the majority refers both 308 ----- individually to each company and to the group as a whole, without the intercompany claims being taken into account); and (E) the refinancing agreement and the documents substantiating performance of conditions (ii) to (iii) above are formalized in a public instrument. When such refinancing agreements obtains the court’s homologation, it may not be subject to any clawback action, except for cases if fraud under general fraudulent conveyance actions. As regards the rules to calculate if the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated facilities agreement will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities thereunder, or a lower majority if the syndicated facilities agreement expressly provides for such lower majority threshold. Whether dissenting lenders have standing to challenge the homologation and whether the crammed down content may fall beyond the statutory one is not clear among Spanish scholars or courts and, therefore, it is not possible yet to ascertain what its practical effects will be. The following effects of an Homologated Refinancing Agreement may be imposed on (i) dissenting or non- participating unsecured financial creditors, and (ii) on secured financial creditors to the extent of that portion of their secured claim not sufficiently covered by the value of the security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in accordance with the valuation rules set out in the Spanish Insolvency Act (i.e. 90% of the collateral fair value minus senior claims): (1) If the Homologated Refinancing Agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities: - stays of payments either of principal, interest or any other owed amount may be granted for up to 5 years; or - the debt converted into PPLs with a tenor up to 5 years. Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting financial creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the rules set out under the Spanish Insolvency Act), when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor. (2) If the Homologated Refinancing Agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities: - a deferral either of principal, interest or any other owed amount for a period of 5 or more years (but not more than 10 years); - haircuts (note that a cap has not been established); - capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may choose between: (i) the debt-for-equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt-for-equity swap; 309 ----- - conversion of debt into PPLs of up to 10 years, convertible obligations, subordinated loans, payment in kind (PIK) facilities or into any other financial instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to those of original debt; and - assignment of assets or rights as payment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio pro soluto or pro solvendo). Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting financial creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the rules set out under the Spanish Insolvency Act), when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor. According to Royal Decree-Law 16/2020, debtors are entitled to apply for an amendment to the composition agreement under two scenarios: (a) within twelve months of the declaration of the current State of Alarm (declared March 14, 2020). The amended composition agreement will not affect (i) claims accrued during the period of performance of the original composition agreement and (ii) privileged creditors, unless they vote in favor of or expressly adhere to the amended composition amendment. (b) within three months after a six-month period following the declaration of the State of Alarm, during which creditors could request a declaration of breach of the composition agreement. Within the year following the declaration of the State of Alarm: (a) the debtor is released from its obligation to request the liquidation due to the infringement of a composition agreement, provided that the debtor requests an amendment of the composition agreement; and (b) a debtor bound by a Homologated Refinancing Agreement is entitled to communicate to the insolvency court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to amend the existing refinancing agreement or to reach a new refinancing agreement, even if a year has not elapsed since the previous request. _Liquidation_ Failure to obtain the approval of a Reorganization Plan or upon debtor’s petition at any time leads to liquidation. A debtor must file for liquidation after a Reorganization Plan has been approved when it becomes aware of its renovated insolvency situation or its inability to comply with the Reorganization Plan. Liquidation triggers such debtor’s dissolution and the Insolvency Administrator stepping into the directors’ shoes. The Insolvency Administrator must prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the Insolvency Court. The Insolvency Administrator is required to produce a quarterly report on the liquidation and has one (1) year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the Insolvency Court may appoint a different Insolvency Administrator. _Termination of the insolvency proceedings_ 310 ----- Insolvency proceedings can also be terminated at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied by other means, or when the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face payment obligations regularly) has been overcome. Finally, it must be noted that Article 473 of the Spanish Insolvency Act foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post-insolvency claims (créditos contra la masa) so long as no future clawback actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceedings as guilty (concurso culpable). _Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_ Under Spanish law, in addition to insolvency clawback actions, the Insolvency Administrator and any creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria _pauliana) against the debtor and the third party that is a party to such contract or agreement,_ provided that such contract or agreement is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - such act was fraudulent; - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as that situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed, as opposed to clawback actions where the subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil): (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is an irrebuttable presumption, while the presumption indicated in (ii) above is a rebuttable presumption. If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Subsequently, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages. _Setoff_ 311 ----- The Spanish Insolvency Act generally prohibits setoff of the credits and debts of the insolvent debtor once it has been declared insolvent, but such setoff where the requirements in order to operate were met before the declaration of insolvency can still apply. However, setoff may be exercised by a creditor _vis-à-vis the insolvent debtor if the governing law of the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it under insolvency scenarios. 312 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.8,"Collateral Regulations”)) may be enforced, except with leave of the court or consent of the",206.8.1,,"administrator (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies 314 ----- the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. Accordingly, if any of the English Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that such permission of the court or consent of the administrator would be obtained. _Qualifying floating charge_ If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “Administration” above) or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “Administrative receivership” below). The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration. A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company, and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. _Administrative receivership_ As noted above, administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very limited circumstances. The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying floating charge where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates September 15, 2003 or where it falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes) creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out-of-court procedure), and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference (see “—Transaction at an undervalue” and “—Preference” above, respectively). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office. _Fixed charge receivership_ 315 ----- A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges – see “—Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute under the Law of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to augment the powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant security document. If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge receivership can be run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration” above). The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the debtor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Prescribed Part” below). _Liquidation/winding up_ Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on insolvency” below). There are two forms of windingup: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (see “—Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the United Kingdom in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts” above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the windingup is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or 316 ----- security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a closeout netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Transaction at an undervalue”, “—Preference”, “— _Transaction defrauding creditors” and “—Extortionate credit transaction” above)._ In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislation has been introduced which temporarily restricts the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. While these measures remain in place, (a) winding-up petitions on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy statutory demands alone are void if the relevant statutory demands were served between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021, and (b) where winding-up petitions are presented between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021 based on other grounds, the petitioning creditor must show that it had reasonable grounds to believe that coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company. Between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021, a court may similarly only grant a winding-up order in circumstances where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts and it appears to the court that coronavirus has had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition if the court is satisfied that the company’s insolvency would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company. _Scheme of arrangement_ Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Guarantor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign company which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. 317 ----- Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a foreign company, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations – often this is achieved by providing expert evidence that the scheme of arrangement is likely to be recognised in such jurisdictions. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. _Restructuring plan_ The CIG Act has introduced a new restructuring plan procedure under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 which is intended broadly to follow the process for a scheme of arrangement, but with the added possibility of a “cross-class cram-down”. A company can propose a restructuring plan to its creditors (and/or its shareholders). Creditors will be divided into classes based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights prior to the restructuring plan and following implementation of the plan. The court must approve the class formation and the convening of restructuring plan meetings. Each class will then vote on whether they approve the plan and provided that sufficient creditors approve the plan and the court considers it a proper exercise of its discretion to sanction the plan, then upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the plan to the Registrar of Companies the plan will be binding on all creditors regardless of whether they, individually or as a class, approved the plan. There are two additional conditions a company must meet in order to use a restructuring plan: (a) the company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (b) a compromise or arrangement must be proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) and the purpose of such compromise or arrangement must be to eliminate, reduce, prevent or mitigate the effect of any of the financial difficulties the company is facing. Before the court considers the sanction of a restructuring plan, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. Creditors whose rights are affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in the meeting and vote on the plan but there is no need to include creditors whose rights are not affected. Furthermore, a court may exclude even a creditor whose rights are affected where it is satisfied that none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company. 318 ----- In respect of a consensual restructuring plan (i.e., one where each class votes in favor) to be capable of being sanctioned by the court, 75% in value of creditors present and voting (in person or by proxy) in each class must agree to the compromise or arrangement. In respect of a “cram-down” restructuring plan (i.e., a restructuring plan where there is a dissenting class of creditors, the court may still sanction a plan, provided that (a) the court is satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative” (referred to below); and (b) the plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% or more in value of a class of creditors, present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. The relevant alternative is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the compromise or arrangement were not sanctioned by the court. The restructuring plan must then be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to saction the restructuring plan. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not automatically trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings. _Company voluntary arrangement_ English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of companies within their general jurisdiction and companies incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA state or with their respective COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark). Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, however, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that its claims are undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. _Priority on insolvency_ One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. 319 ----- In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness); - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors: o ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally; and o secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts. Secondary preferential debts include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking: o firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant 320 ----- insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; o secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration; and o thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. _Prescribed Part_ An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., an administrator or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.9,"Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property",206.9.1,,"and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “Liquidation/winding-up” above). _Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_ Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (e.g. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring 321 ----- plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act). _Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings General position_ The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions. One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain United Kingdom insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom). The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations only provide for recognition of proceedings under British insolvency law, which in relation to England and Wales covers proceedings initiated under the Insolvency Act other than receivership proceedings and members’ voluntary liquidations, and does not extend to restructuring processes governed by corporate law such as schemes of arrangement. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,206,CERTAIN FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS,206.10,Convention”) (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending accession to the latter) where these,206.10.1,,"apply. In addition, recognition is still possible under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether, restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings, and fall within related exceptions to such treaties. _Recognition in the EU_ Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, United Kingdom proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the United Kingdom do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of United 322 ----- Kingdom insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the United Kingdom and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for United Kingdom restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for United Kingdom office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a United Kingdom office holder is made in reliance on a United Kingdom domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognised in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an additional basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United Kingdom was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognised and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. 323 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

Most of the directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities and/or the French Individuals are located outside the United States.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex _parte) proceedings if such U.S. Judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French_ civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court, the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus 331 ----- be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, European and French data protection rules (including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and French law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or applicable overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with a French person. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. 332 ----- There are diverging positions amongst the chambers of the French Supreme Court (Cour de _Cassation) regarding the validity of a contractual provision submitting one party to the_ exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction. On the one hand, further to several decisions—the most recent dated October 3, 2018—the first civil chamber of the _Cour de Cassation seems to consider that, unless the competent courts can be identified by reference to objective elements or jurisdiction rules in force in a Member State, unilateral jurisdiction clauses do not comply with the objective of foreseeability set out in the international instruments applicable in these cases and are therefore invalid. On the other hand, the Commercial Chamber of the Cour de Cassation has held that a unilateral jurisdiction clause is valid, by a decision rendered on May 11, 2017. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents may not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

In addition, all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons and the Italian Guarantor are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and the Italian Guarantor, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of Italian law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes or the Guarantee against the Italian Guarantor and/or Italian individuals. Recognition and enforcement in the Republic of Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that, pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31,1995 (Riforma del _sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato), among others, the following conditions are_ met: - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction upon the relevant matter according to Italian law principles of jurisdiction; - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with - U.S. law and during the proceedings no fundamental right of the defendant was violated; - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of a party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law; - the judgment is final and is not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law; - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court; - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico). 333 ----- In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31,1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal (Corte d’Appello) in the Republic of Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above. In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory, and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought _(e.g.,_ punitive damages) if their application violates any Italian public policies and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368

All of the directors and executive officers of the Spanish Guarantors reside outside the United States. In addition, all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons and the Spanish Guarantors are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons or the Spanish Guarantors in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. A final judgment obtained against the Spanish Guarantors or their related individuals outside of Spain (and, in particular, in the United States), other than a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy) pursuant to the following regimes: - according to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between Spain and the United States for these purposes); - in the absence of any such treaty, the judgment would be enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following requirements in compliance with and subject to Article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil) and subject to Act 29/2015, of July 30, on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional en materia civil) (the “Act on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”): o such U.S. judgment is final and conclusive (firme); o such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is clearly connected to the United States and the choice of the court is not fraudulent; o such U.S. judgment does not contravene Spanish public policy rules (orden _público) or mandatory provisions, and the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in_ Spain; o the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement is accompanied by a literal, authentic, sworn Spanish translation; o the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is duly apostilled; 334 ----- o there is not a pending previous proceedings between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in Spain; o there is no material contradiction or incompatibility of such U.S. judgment with a judgment rendered or judicial proceedings outstanding in Spain, or a judgment previously rendered in another country when this last judgment meets the requirements to be eventually recognized in Spain; o where rendering the judgment, the courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and the choice of court is not fraudulent; o the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including, but not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its defense and the U.S. judgment was not rendered by default (i.e. without appearance or without the possibility to appear for the defendant); and o although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the U.S. jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish courts on a general basis, then the Spanish courts could be compelled to deny the recognition of the U.S. judgment in Spain. It is important to note that Act on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revision del fondo) by the Spanish competent court. The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Court of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil). The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the Spanish Guarantors, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs (costas judiciales) and interest will be paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the Spanish Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby. The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs: - translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); - certain professional fees for the verification of the legal representative of a party litigating in Spain, (if needed); - payment of certain court costs and fees; - the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and - the contents and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts. 335 ----- Moreover, please note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will, therefore, prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes. Notwithstanding the parties’ choice of foreign jurisdiction, the Spanish courts may in certain circumstances, including where considerations of Spanish public policy require it, take jurisdiction or grant ancillary relief in relation to proceedings commenced in a foreign court (including the chosen court). If an original action is brought in Spain, Spanish courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes Spanish public policy. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil), the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree on their submission to a particular judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) provided that, under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act and the Spanish Judicial Act (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial), the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the relevant dispute); therefore such article does not cover the validity of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
124,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.5,England,28.5.1,,"Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of England. We have been advised by Latham & Watkins (London) LLP, our English counsel, that the United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; 336 ----- - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to utilize any method or methods of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the judgment or against the foreign judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, of if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings. 337 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,368
