1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"In this offering circular, we use a measure that we refer to as “Covenant Adjusted EBITDA.” Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of Aramark Services, Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries only and does not include the results of Aramark. “Covenant Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) of Aramark Services, Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries plus interest and other financing costs, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance under the senior secured credit agreement (as defined herein), the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” This measure is derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. You should not consider this measure as an alternative to net income or operating income determined in accordance with GAAP. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by us, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations. For a reconciliation of net income attributable to Aramark Services, Inc.’s stockholder, which is a GAAP measure of Aramark Services, Inc.’s operating results, to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial Data” in this offering circular.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Avendra and AmeriPride Acquisitions,9.2.1,,"On October 13, 2017, we announced that we entered into definitive agreements to acquire, in separate transactions, Avendra, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Avendra”), and AmeriPride 3 ----- Services Inc., a Delaware corporation (“AmeriPride”). On December 11, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Avendra. _Avendra_ Avendra is a leading hospitality procurement services provider in North America, managing purchasing spend for over 650 companies at more than 8,500 locations. Avendra was founded in 2001 by five hospitality organizations: Marriott, Hyatt, Fairmont Hotels, ClubCorp and IHG. While we currently provide procurement services in our FSS segments on a limited basis, we believe the Avendra acquisition will significantly expand our capabilities and client reach in this area. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017, Avendra had revenue of $138.2 million, net income of $67.0 million and adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating profit, plus depreciation and amortization plus share based compensation expense) of $83.2 million. We paid an aggregate purchase price of $1,350.0 million to acquire Avendra, which amount is subject to certain post-closing adjustments (the “Avendra Purchase Price”). As discussed below under “—Incremental Amendment No. 2 to Senior Secured Credit Facilities,” the Avendra Purchase Price was financed through borrowings under our Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below). $10 million of the Avendra Purchase Price will be held in escrow to satisfy any post-closing obligations. _AmeriPride_ AmeriPride is a highly respected uniform and linen rental and supply company headquartered in Minneapolis with 6,000 employees serving 150,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada. The acquisition of AmeriPride will add scale and capabilities to our uniforms business in the U.S. while immediately establishing Aramark as a leading uniform services provider in Canada, where our existing operations are very limited. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017, AmeriPride had rental revenue of $600.7 million, net income of $22.0 million and adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating profit, plus depreciation and amortization plus share based compensation expense) of $69.4 million. The purchase price for AmeriPride is $1,000.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger among the Company, AmeriPride and certain other parties (the “AmeriPride Merger Agreement”). The completion of the AmeriPride acquisition is subject to a number of customary conditions. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the purchase price for the AmeriPride acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The consummation of this offering is conditioned upon the prior or substantially concurrent consummation of the AmeriPride acquisition. The notes offered hereby will be guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries, including Avendra (and certain of its domestic subsidiaries) and, following completion of its acquisition, AmeriPride (and certain of its domestic subsidiaries). _Incremental Amendment No. 2 to Senior Secured Credit Facilities_ On December 11, 2017, we entered into Incremental Amendment No. 2 (the “Incremental Amendment”) with the financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent for the Lenders (as defined below) and collateral agent for the secured parties thereunder, to our credit agreement, dated March 28, 2017 (the “Credit Agreement”), among the financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, the issuer, Aramark Intermediate HoldCo Corporation, each subsidiary of the issuer party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and collateral agent.

We refer to (i) this offering, (ii) the application of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the purchase price for the AmeriPride acquisition and repay $150.0 million of the Amendment No. 2 Revolver Borrowing, (iii) the borrowings under the Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility, (iv) the use of the proceeds from the Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility to finance the Avendra acquisition and a portion of the Term Loan A Repayment, (v) the Amendment No. 2 Revolver Borrowing and the use of proceeds therefrom to fund the remainder of the Term Loan A Repayment and (vi) the payment of fees and expenses related to the foregoing, as the “Acquisition Financing Transactions.”",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

In addition, “client” refers to those businesses and other organizations that engage us to provide services. Unless otherwise stated to the contrary herein, information included or incorporated by reference into this offering circular does not give effect to the Avendra acquisition, AmeriPride acquisition or the financing transactions described under “—Recent Developments—Avendra and AmeriPride Acquisitions” or “—Recent Developments—Incremental Canadian Term Loan.” Neither acquisition is considered “significant,” as defined by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act._",N/A,as_expected,2018,126
1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness,13.1.1,"Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industries, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.","We are highly leveraged. As of September 29, 2017, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $5,300.9 million and we had availability of $998.5 million under our revolving credit facility (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit). As of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness would have been $7,652.1 million and we would have had availability of $948.5 million under our revolving credit facility (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit). This degree of leverage could have important consequences, including: - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables facility, are at variable rates of interest; - making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and - limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the senior secured credit agreement, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126
1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness,13.1.2,"If our financial performance were to deteriorate, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.","Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive 15 ----- conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. While we believe that we currently have adequate cash flows to service our indebtedness, if our financial performance were to deteriorate significantly, we might be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If, due to such a deterioration in our financial performance, our cash flows and capital resources were to be insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, if we were required to raise additional capital in the current financial markets, the terms of such financing, if available, could result in higher costs and greater restrictions on our business. In addition, none of our significant long-term borrowings mature prior to 2019, if we were to need to refinance our existing indebtedness, the conditions in the financial markets at that time could make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. If such alternative measures proved unsuccessful, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The senior secured credit agreement, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and to refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126
1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness,13.1.3,Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.,"The senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: - incur additional indebtedness, refinance or restructure indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; - pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, make unscheduled payments on our notes, repurchase or redeem our senior notes or make other restricted payments; - make certain investments; - sell certain assets; - create liens; - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. In addition, our senior secured revolving credit facility requires us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and in the event of a significant deterioration of our financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will satisfy those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit agreement. Upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants that is not waived by the lenders under the revolving credit facility, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such facilities. If we were unable to repay 16 ----- those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the senior secured credit agreement. If the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings, as well as our unsecured indebtedness. If our senior secured indebtedness was accelerated by the lenders as a result of a default, the Existing Notes and the notes may become due and payable as well. Any such acceleration may also constitute an amortization event under our receivables facility, which could result in the amount outstanding under that facility becoming due and payable.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Notes,13.2.2,Repayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.,"Our subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes. 17 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under the senior secured credit agreement, the lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby at such time. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the notes will not be secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” As of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, our outstanding secured indebtedness would be $4,113.8 million in aggregate principal amount (including $114.4 million of payment obligations relating to capital lease obligations and $254.2 million under our receivables facility) and we would have had unutilized capacity of $948.5 million under our revolving credit facility available (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit). The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit us and our restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including senior secured indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

Accordingly, claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and holders of any indebtedness issued by these non-guarantor subsidiaries. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the notes. After giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions (but for the avoidance of doubt, neither the Avendra acquisition nor the AmeriPride acquisition), our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have accounted for $3,854.8 million, or approximately 26.4%, of our sales and $190.4 million, or approximately 23.6%, of our operating income, in each case for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017, and $3,356.0 million, or approximately 30.5%, of our total assets and $1,376.2 million (excluding intercompany liabilities), or approximately 16.1%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of September 29, 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

See “Description of the Notes.” The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances.

The consummation of this offering is not conditioned upon the prior or substantially concurrent consummation of the AmeriPride acquisition. Our ability to consummate the AmeriPride acquisition is subject to various conditions, some of which are beyond our control. We are required to redeem all of the notes in the event that we do not complete the AmeriPride acquisition on or prior to April 30, 2018, or if, prior to such date, the AmeriPride Merger Agreement is terminated, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption.” If we are required to redeem the notes pursuant to the redemption provision, you may not obtain your expected return on the notes and may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that results in a comparable return. Your decision to invest in the notes is made at the time of the offering of the notes. You will have no rights under the redemption provision described in the immediately preceding paragraph if the AmeriPride acquisition is completed on or prior to April 30, 2018. You will also not have any right to require us to redeem your notes if, between the closing of the notes offering and the completion of the AmeriPride acquisition, we experience any changes in our business or financial condition or if the terms of the AmeriPride acquisition change.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126
1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Notes,13.2.7,We may not be able to redeem the notes upon a Special Mandatory Redemption Event.,"Upon the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption”), we will be required to redeem each holder’s notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined in “Description of the Notes— Special mandatory redemption”). If a Special Mandatory Redemption Event occurs, we may not have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to redeem the notes. In the event we are required to make the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment (as defined in “Description of Notes—Special mandatory redemption”), we expect that we would seek third-party financing to the extent we do not have sufficient funds available to meet our redemption obligations. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain the consents necessary to make the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment from the lenders under agreements governing outstanding Indebtedness that may in the future prohibit the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment. Our failure to redeem the notes as required under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby would result in a default thereunder, which could result in defaults under our and our subsidiaries’ other debt agreements and have material adverse 19 ----- consequences for us and the holders of the notes. See “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption.” Moreover, if we are required to make a Special Mandatory Redemption Payment, it could cause a default under our existing or future debt, even if the Special Mandatory Redemption Event itself does not result in a default under existing or future debt, due to the financial effect of such redemption on us.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126
1050_2,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Notes,13.2.8,We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.,"Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of the notes will be cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Our failure to repurchase the notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (1) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the notes or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true at the time hereof: - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees; - the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business; - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or - we or any of the guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us or such guarantor if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or limit the amount of payment or subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor, or require you to repay any amounts received. In the event of a finding that fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any payment on the notes. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. Under applicable law, a court may determine that a debtor has not received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at 20 ----- the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the notes or the guarantees would not be voided, limited in amount or subordinated to our or any of our guarantors’ other debt. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time.

Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active market for any of the notes will develop or, if developed, that it will continue. The conditions of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if any, for any of the notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes.

Aramark Receivables, LLC was formed for the sole purpose of transferring receivables generated by certain of our subsidiaries. Under this receivables facility, we and certain of our subsidiaries transfer without recourse all of their accounts receivable to Aramark Receivables, LLC. As collections reduce previously transferred interests, interests in new, eligible receivables are transferred to Aramark Receivables, LLC, subject to meeting certain conditions.

As of September 29, 2017, $254.2 million was outstanding under the receivables facility. Availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding accounts receivable balance of our subsidiaries that participate in the facility.

None of our Restricted Subsidiaries that are Foreign Subsidiaries, including Aramark International Finance S.à r.l., the issuer of the 2025 Euro Notes, or any Receivables Subsidiary and certain immaterial subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Although Aramark is providing a parent guarantee of the Notes for purposes of financial reporting, it is not a “Guarantor” and its guarantee is not a “Guarantee,” in each case as defined in and for purposes of this “Description of the Notes.” Each Guarantee will be a general unsecured senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and any future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, will be effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the collateral securing such Indebtedness, and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Company that do not guarantee the Notes. See also “—Brief description of the notes and the guarantees.” Each Guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the Guarantor’s liability thereunder to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its Guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless.

However, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future Secured Indebtedness (including Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness. As of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, the Company and its Subsidiaries would have had $7,652.1 million aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding (excluding unused commitments), including Indebtedness represented by the Notes offered hereby, $900.0 million of Indebtedness represented by the 2024 Notes, $600.0 million of Indebtedness represented by the 2025 Dollar Notes, €325.0 million (approximately $384.0 million as of September 29, 2017) of Indebtedness represented by the 2025 Euro Notes, $500.0 million of Indebtedness represented by the 2026 Notes, $3,745.2 million of Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, $254.2 million of Indebtedness outstanding under the Receivables Facility and $114.4 million of Indebtedness in respect of Capitalized Lease Obligations. In addition, as of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, the Company and its Subsidiaries would have been able to incur an additional $948.5 million of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. A significant portion of the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including the holders of the Notes. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness by and the issuance of Disqualified Stock and preferred stock of certain of the 37 ----- Company’s Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. See “—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock.” Not all of our Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of September 29, 2017, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries had $1,376.2 million of total indebtedness and other claims and liabilities (excluding intercompany liabilities), all of which would have been structurally senior to the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and other liabilities, including their trade creditors and holders of their preferred stock, if any, before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. After giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions (but for the avoidance of doubt, neither the Avendra acquisition nor the AmeriPride acquisition), our non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have accounted for $3,854.8 million, or approximately 26.4%, of our sales and $190.4 million, or approximately 23.6%, of our operating income, in each case for the year ended September 29, 2017, and $3,356.0 million, or approximately 30.5%, of our total assets and $1,376.2 million (excluding intercompany liabilities), or approximately 16.1%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of September 29, 2017. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial.

Upon the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the Company will promptly (but in no event later than five business days following such Special Mandatory Redemption Event) notify the 38 ----- Trustee in writing of such event, and the Trustee will, no later than five business days following receipt of such notice from the Company, notify the Holders (such date of notification to the Holders, the “Redemption Notice Date”), that the notes will be redeemed on the 30th day following the Redemption Notice Date (such date, the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”), in each case in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture.

If a Special Mandatory Redemption Event occurs, there can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient funds available to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price with respect to the notes on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. In the event the Company is required to make the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment, the Company expects that it would seek third-party financing to the extent it does not have sufficient funds available to meet its redemption obligations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such financing. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain the consents necessary to make the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment from the lenders under agreements governing outstanding Indebtedness that may in the future prohibit the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Company; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Company to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the last day of the offer period, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; 41 ----- (7) Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and (8) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, such notice shall state that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and describe such condition, and, if applicable, state that, in the Company’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed. While the Notes are in global form and the Company makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Company. The paying agent will promptly mail to each Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The Senior Credit Facilities will (subject to limited exceptions), and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may, prohibit the Company from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of their lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings and notes that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Senior Credit Facilities provide that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect to the Company (including a Change of Control under the Indenture) constitute a default thereunder. If the Company experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior 42 ----- Credit Facilities or cross-defaults under any other Indebtedness or the Receivables Facility, the Company could seek a waiver of such defaults or seek to refinance the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and such other Indebtedness. In the event the Company does not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and such other Indebtedness, such defaults could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and such other Indebtedness being declared due and payable and cause the Receivables Facility to be wound down. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.” The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the time and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. We have no current intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock.” Such restrictions can be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. 43 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

Within 450 days after any of the Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may, at its option, apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale: (1) to permanently reduce (a) Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor (other than Obligations owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) and, in the case of Obligations under revolving credit facilities or other similar Indebtedness, to correspondingly permanently reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided that if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness that is not secured by a Lien permitted by the Indenture, the Company or such Guarantor will, equally and ratably, reduce Obligations under the Notes by, at its option, (i) redeeming Notes, (ii) making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased or (iii) purchasing Notes through open market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at a price equal to or higher than 100% of the principal amount thereof) in a manner that complies with the Indenture and applicable securities law or (b) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary; or (2) to make (a) an investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business 44 ----- such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) an investment in properties, (c) capital expenditures and (d) acquisitions of other assets, that in each of (a), (b), (c) and (d), are used or useful in the business of the Company and in Restricted Subsidiaries or replace the businesses, properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale. Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph within 450 days from the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that if during such 450-day period the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into a definitive binding agreement committing it to apply such Net Proceeds in accordance with the requirements of clause (2) of the immediately preceding paragraph after such 450th day, such 450-day period will be extended with respect to the amount of Net Proceeds so committed until such Net Proceeds are required to be applied in accordance with such agreement (but such extension will in no event be for a period longer than 180 days) (or, if earlier, the date of termination of such agreement). When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required by the terms of any Senior Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (other than with respect to Hedging Obligations) (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and such Senior Indebtedness that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Company will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed $100.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days or with respect to Excess Proceeds of $100.0 million or less. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Senior Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture.

Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds related to such Asset Sale Offer shall be reset at zero. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

On and after the Reversion Date as defined with respect to the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the option of holders—Change of control,” the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the such covenant under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to a proposed transaction described in clause (b) above.

Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by 102 ----- such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture with respect to the notes. Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the issuer, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Notice to Investors.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time.

Any resale of the notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws. Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this offering circular (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor. Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering. The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, 116 ----- advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the issuer and to persons and entities with relationships with the issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates also provide funding under the Issuer’s receivables facility. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under our revolving credit facility and, as a result of such role, will receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from this offering used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have agreed to provide us with interim financing in the amount of $975.0 million in the event this offering is not consummated. U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., one of the Initial Purchasers, is an affiliate of the trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the issuer. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments. If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with the Issuer, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The Issuer expects that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2018, which will be the business day following the date of this offering circular (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes will initially settle T+, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. 117 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,126

The Initial Purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the notes being offered, if any are taken. The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular. After the notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The offering of the notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the purchase agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the notes pursuant to this offering circular. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom it sells such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. 113 ----- In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Issuer has agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering circular, neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates over which it exercises management or voting control, nor any person acting on its behalf will, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes. The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. The Initial Purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates have repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such Initial Purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions. These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.",N/A,as_expected,2018,126
