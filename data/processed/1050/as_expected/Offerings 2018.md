#### $1,150,000,000

### Aramark Services, Inc.
% Senior Notes due 2028


The Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) are offering the notes to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act (as defined below). In addition, the Initial Purchasers, through their respective selling agents, are offering
the notes outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand, to pay the purchase price for the AmeriPride acquisition, repay
borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Avendra and
AmeriPride Acquisitions—AmeriPride.” The consummation of this offering is not conditioned upon the prior or substantially concurrent
consummation of the AmeriPride acquisition. See “Use of Proceeds.” If the AmeriPride acquisition is not completed on or prior to April 30, 2018, or
if, prior to such date, the AmeriPride Merger Agreement (as defined below) is terminated, then in either case we will be required to redeem the
notes as described under “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption.”
Aramark Services, Inc. (the “Issuer”) will pay interest on the notes on and of each year. The first such payment will be made
on, 2018. The notes will mature on, 2028. The Issuer has the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time on or
after, 2023 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering circular, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to, 2021, the Issuer
may redeem up to 40% of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering circular, plus
accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time prior to, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Issuer may be required
to offer to purchase the notes from holders if the Issuer experiences specific kinds of changes of control or sell certain assets.
The notes will be the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior
indebtedness, including its senior secured credit facilities (as defined herein), 5.125% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), 5.000% Senior Notes
due 2025 (the “2025 Dollar Notes”) and 4.750% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes” and, together with the 2024 Notes and the 2025 Dollar Notes,
the “Existing Dollar Notes”) and its guarantee of Aramark International Finance S.à r.l.’s 3.125% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Euro Notes” and,
together with the Existing Dollar Notes, the “Existing Notes”), and will rank senior in right of payment to the Issuer’s future subordinated indebtedness.
Aramark and each of the Issuer’s domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the senior secured credit facilities and the Existing Notes will unconditionally
guarantee the notes with guarantees that will rank equal in right of payment to all of the senior obligations of such guarantor, including guarantees of the
senior secured credit facilities and the Existing Notes. The notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s existing
and future secured indebtedness, including guarantees of the Issuer’s senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing
that indebtedness. The notes and guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the notes, including Aramark International Finance S.à r.l. Aramark, the indirect parent company of Aramark Services, Inc., will also
guarantee the notes for purposes of financial reporting only. Although Aramark is providing a parent guarantee of the notes for purposes of financial
reporting, it is not a “guarantor” and its guarantee is not a “guarantee,” in each case as such terms are used in this offering circular, and it will not be
subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.
The notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. The notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in
reliance on Rule 144A will be evidenced by a global note deposited with a custodian for and registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository
Trust Company. Except as described herein, beneficial interests in the global note will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only
through, records maintained by The Depository Trust Company and its direct and indirect participants. Any notes sold pursuant to Regulation S will
be evidenced by one or more separate global notes.
The Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes in any automated quotation
system.
**_Investing in the notes offered hereby involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15 of this offering circular and the risk_**
**_factors contained in Aramark’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017, incorporated by reference_**
**_herein, to read about important factors you should consider before buying the notes offered hereby._**

**Offering Price:** **%**
The offering price set forth above does not include accrued interest, if any. Interest on the notes will accrue from, 2018. If the notes
are delivered after, 2018, accrued interest must be paid by the purchaser until the time of delivery.


**The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and are being offered and sold only to persons**
**reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons**
**in transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are qualified**
**institutional buyers are hereby notified that the seller of the notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the**
**Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The notes are not transferable except in accordance with the restrictions described under “Notice**
**to Investors”.**

The Initial Purchasers expect to deliver the notes through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company against payment in New York,

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public
offering. The notes offered hereby may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or
in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

In this offering circular, we use a measure that we refer to as “Covenant Adjusted EBITDA.”
Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of Aramark Services, Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries only
and does not include the results of Aramark. “Covenant Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income
(loss) of Aramark Services, Inc. and its restricted subsidiaries plus interest and other financing costs,
net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to give
effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance under the senior secured
credit agreement (as defined herein), the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture
that will govern the notes offered hereby. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” This measure is
derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”).

Our presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
You should not consider this measure as an alternative to net income or operating income determined
in accordance with GAAP. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by us, may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical
calculations.

For a reconciliation of net income attributable to Aramark Services, Inc.’s stockholder, which is a
GAAP measure of Aramark Services, Inc.’s operating results, to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, see
“Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial Data” in this offering circular.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

The data included or incorporated by reference in this offering circular regarding sectors,
geographies and ranking, including the size of certain sectors and geographies and our position and
the position of our competitors within these sectors and geographies, are based on our management’s
knowledge and experience in the sectors and geographies in which we operate. We believe these
estimates to be accurate as of the date of this offering circular. However, this information may prove to
be inaccurate because of the method by which we obtained some of the data for the estimates or
because this information cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to the limits on the
availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other
limitations and uncertainties. As a result, you should be aware that sector size, ranking and other
similar industry data included or incorporated by reference in this offering circular, and estimates and
beliefs based on that data, may not be reliable. While we believe internal company research is reliable,
such research has not been verified by any independent source.

**STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION**

This offering circular contains and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including forward-looking
statements in “Item 1. Business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” incorporated by reference in this offering circular from Aramark’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017 (“Aramark’s Fiscal 2017
10-K”). These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or
current facts. They use words such as “outlook,” “aim,” “anticipate,” “are confident,” “have confidence,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,”
“see,” “look to” and other words and terms of similar meaning or the negative versions of such words.

iii


-----

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. All statements we make relating to our
estimated and projected earnings, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates, financial results and
the costs and benefits of the Avendra and AmeriPride acquisitions and related financings are forwardlooking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forwardlooking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other
developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we
expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and
forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions
are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course,
it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations (“cautionary statements”) are
disclosed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in or incorporated by reference in this offering circular,
including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking statements included or incorporated
by reference in this offering circular. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements. Some of the factors that we believe could affect our results or the costs and
benefits of the Avendra and AmeriPride acquisitions and related financings include without limitation:

   - unfavorable economic conditions;

   - natural disasters, global calamities, sports strikes and other adverse incidents;

   - the failure to retain current clients, renew existing client contracts and obtain new client
contracts;

   - a determination by clients to reduce their outsourcing or use of preferred vendors;

   - competition in our industries;

   - increased operating costs and obstacles to cost recovery due to the pricing and cancellation
terms of our food and support services contracts;

   - the inability to achieve cost savings through our cost reduction efforts;

   - our expansion strategy;

   - the failure to maintain food safety throughout our supply chain, food-borne illness concerns and
claims of illness or injury;

   - governmental regulations including those relating to food and beverages, the environment,
wage and hour and government contracting;

   - liability associated with noncompliance with applicable law or other governmental regulations;

   - new interpretations of or changes in the enforcement of the government regulatory framework;

   - currency risks and other risks associated with international operations, including Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption law compliance;

   - continued or further unionization of our workforce;

   - liability resulting from our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans;

   - risks associated with suppliers from whom our products are sourced;

   - disruptions to our relationship with, or to the business of, our primary distributor;

   - the inability to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or increases in labor costs;

   - healthcare reform legislation;

   - the contract intensive nature of our business, which may lead to client disputes;

iv


-----

   - seasonality;

   - disruptions in the availability of our computer systems or privacy breaches;

   - failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls;

   - our leverage;

   - the inability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness;

   - debt agreements that limit our flexibility in operating our business;

   - our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of Avendra and AmeriPride and costs and
timing related thereto;

   - the risk of unanticipated restructuring costs or assumption of undisclosed liabilities;

   - the risk that we are unable to achieve the anticipated benefits (including tax benefits) and
synergies of the acquisitions of AmeriPride and Avendra including whether the transactions will
be accretive and within the expected time frames;

   - our ability to complete the anticipated financing of the AmeriPride acquisition on our expected
terms;

   - the availability of sufficient cash to repay certain indebtedness and our decision to utilize the
cash for that purpose;

   - the disruption to each of Avendra and AmeriPride and their respective managements from the
acquisitions;

   - the effect of the acquisitions on each of Avendra’s and AmeriPride’s ability to retain and hire
key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties;

   - our ability to attract new or maintain existing customer and supplier relationships at reasonable
cost;

   - our ability to retain key personnel; and

   - other factors set forth under “Risk Factors” or incorporated by reference in this offering circular.

We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material
factors that are important to you. In addition, in light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters
referred to in the forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this offering
circular may not in fact occur. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, changes in our
expectations, or otherwise, except as required by law.

**Our Company**

We are a leading global provider of food, facilities and uniform services to education, healthcare,
business & industry, and sports, leisure & corrections clients. Our core market is North America
(composed of the United States and Canada), which is supplemented by an additional 17-country
footprint. We hold the #2 position in North America in food and facilities services as well as uniform
services based on total sales in fiscal 2017. Internationally, we hold a top 3 position in food and
facilities services based on total sales in fiscal 2017 in most countries in which we have significant
operations, and are one of only 3 food and facilities competitors with our combination of scale, scope,
and global reach. Through our established brand, broad geographic presence and approximately
260,500 employees, we anchor our business in our partnerships with thousands of education,
healthcare, business and sports, leisure & corrections clients. Through these partnerships we serve
millions of consumers including students, patients, employees, sports fans and guests worldwide. In
fiscal 2017, we generated sales of $14,604.4 million, operating income of $808.1 million and Covenant
Adjusted EBITDA of $1,432.2 million. See “Summary—Summary consolidated financial data” for our
definition of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to the
issuer’s net income.

We operate our business in three reportable segments that share many of the same operating
characteristics: Food and Support Services North America (“FSS North America”), Food and Support
Services International (“FSS International”) and Uniform and Career Apparel (“Uniform”). Both FSS
North America and Uniform have significant scale and hold the #2 position in North America, while in
our FSS International segment we hold a top 3 position in most countries in which we have significant

Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and in each of these countries we are one of the leading
food and/or facilities service providers. We also have a strong presence in Japan through our 50%
ownership of AIM Services Co., Ltd., which is a leader in providing outsourced food services in Japan.
In addition to the core Business & Industry sector, our FSS International segment serves many soccer
stadiums across Europe, and numerous educational institutions, correctional institutions and
convention centers globally. There are particular risks attendant with our international operations.
Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Aramark’s Fiscal 2017 10-K incorporated by reference in this
offering circular.

**_Uniform_**

Our Uniform segment provides uniforms and other garments and work clothes and ancillary items
such as mats and shop towels in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and through a joint venture in
Japan. We hold the #2 position in the North America uniform services market. We operate over 2,700
routes, giving us a broad reach to service our clients’ needs. Clients use our uniforms to meet a variety
of needs, including establishing corporate identity and brand awareness, projecting a professional
image, protecting workers and protecting products.

We provide a full service employee uniform solution, including design, sourcing and
manufacturing, delivery, cleaning and maintenance. We rent uniforms, work clothing, outerwear,
particulate-free garments and non-garment items and related services, including industrial towels, floor
mats, mops, linen products, and paper products to businesses in a wide range of industries, including
manufacturing, food services, automotive, healthcare, construction, utilities, repair and maintenance
services, restaurant and hospitality. In fiscal 2017, our Uniform segment generated $1,564.7 million in
sales, or 11% of our total sales.

We serve businesses of all sizes in many different industries. We have a diverse client base from
over 200 service locations and distribution centers across the United States and one service center in
Ontario, Canada. None of our clients individually represents a material portion of our sales. We
typically visit our clients’ sites weekly, delivering clean, finished uniforms and, at the same time,
removing the soiled uniforms or other items for cleaning, repair or replacement. We also offer products
for direct sale.

Our cleanroom service offers advanced static dissipative garments, barrier apparel, sterile
garments and cleanroom application accessories for clients with contamination-free operations in the
technology, healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.

We conduct our direct marketing business through three primary brands—WearGuard, Crest and
Aramark. We design, source or manufacture and distribute distinctive image apparel to workers in a
wide variety of industries through the internet at www.shoparamark.com, dedicated sales
representatives and telemarketing sales channels. We customize and embroider personalized uniforms
and logos for clients through an extensive computer assisted design center and distribute work
clothing, outerwear, business casual apparel and footwear throughout the United States, Puerto Rico
and Canada.

acquisition of Avendra.

_Avendra_

Avendra is a leading hospitality procurement services provider in North America, managing
purchasing spend for over 650 companies at more than 8,500 locations. Avendra was founded in 2001
by five hospitality organizations: Marriott, Hyatt, Fairmont Hotels, ClubCorp and IHG. While we
currently provide procurement services in our FSS segments on a limited basis, we believe the
Avendra acquisition will significantly expand our capabilities and client reach in this area. For the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017, Avendra had revenue of $138.2 million, net income
of $67.0 million and adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating profit, plus depreciation and amortization
plus share based compensation expense) of $83.2 million.

We paid an aggregate purchase price of $1,350.0 million to acquire Avendra, which amount is
subject to certain post-closing adjustments (the “Avendra Purchase Price”). As discussed below under
“—Incremental Amendment No. 2 to Senior Secured Credit Facilities,” the Avendra Purchase Price
was financed through borrowings under our Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined
below). $10 million of the Avendra Purchase Price will be held in escrow to satisfy any post-closing
obligations.

_AmeriPride_

AmeriPride is a highly respected uniform and linen rental and supply company headquartered in
Minneapolis with 6,000 employees serving 150,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada. The acquisition
of AmeriPride will add scale and capabilities to our uniforms business in the U.S. while immediately
establishing Aramark as a leading uniform services provider in Canada, where our existing operations
are very limited. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017, AmeriPride had rental
revenue of $600.7 million, net income of $22.0 million and adjusted EBITDA (defined as operating
profit, plus depreciation and amortization plus share based compensation expense) of $69.4 million.

The purchase price for AmeriPride is $1,000.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, set forth in
the Agreement and Plan of Merger among the Company, AmeriPride and certain other parties (the
“AmeriPride Merger Agreement”). The completion of the AmeriPride acquisition is subject to a number
of customary conditions.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the purchase price for the
AmeriPride acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The consummation of this offering is
conditioned upon the prior or substantially concurrent consummation of the AmeriPride acquisition. The
notes offered hereby will be guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries, including
Avendra (and certain of its domestic subsidiaries) and, following completion of its acquisition,
AmeriPride (and certain of its domestic subsidiaries).

_Incremental Amendment No. 2 to Senior Secured Credit Facilities_

On December 11, 2017, we entered into Incremental Amendment No. 2 (the “Incremental
Amendment”) with the financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
administrative agent for the Lenders (as defined below) and collateral agent for the secured parties
thereunder, to our credit agreement, dated March 28, 2017 (the “Credit Agreement”), among the
financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, the issuer, Aramark Intermediate HoldCo Corporation,
each subsidiary of the issuer party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent
and collateral agent. The Incremental Amendment provided for an incremental senior secured credit

facility (the “Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility”) under the Credit Agreement comprised of a
U.S. dollar denominated “term B-1” loan in an amount equal to $1,785.0 million, maturing on March 11,
2025.

The Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility was funded in full on December 11, 2017 and we
used the proceeds therefrom to (a) finance the Avendra acquisition and (b) together with the proceeds
of a $200.0 million borrowing made under the Credit Agreement’s revolving credit facility (the
“Amendment No. 2 Revolver Borrowing”), to repay the remaining U.S. dollar denominated term A loans
outstanding under the Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan A Repayment”) and to pay related fees and
expenses.

We refer to (i) this offering, (ii) the application of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the
purchase price for the AmeriPride acquisition and repay $150.0 million of the Amendment No. 2
Revolver Borrowing, (iii) the borrowings under the Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility, (iv) the
use of the proceeds from the Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facility to finance the Avendra
acquisition and a portion of the Term Loan A Repayment, (v) the Amendment No. 2 Revolver
Borrowing and the use of proceeds therefrom to fund the remainder of the Term Loan A Repayment
and (vi) the payment of fees and expenses related to the foregoing, as the “Acquisition Financing
Transactions.”

**Incremental Canadian Term Loan**

Substantially concurrent with this offering, we intend to amend our Credit Agreement to, among
other things, permit the incurrence of incremental Canadian Term Loan (as defined herein) borrowings
in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million equivalent and use the proceeds therefrom to
repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The proposed incremental Canadian Term Loan
amendment is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance that the
amendments will be completed on the terms contemplated or at all. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”

its domestic subsidiaries) and, following completion of its acquisition, AmeriPride (and certain of
its domestic subsidiaries).
(5) The 2025 Euro Notes were issued by Aramark International Finance S.à r.l. and are guaranteed
on a senior, unsecured basis by the issuer and the issuer’s subsidiaries that guarantee the
Existing Dollar Notes.
(6) Our receivables facility provides for up to $350.0 million of funding, based, in part, on the amount
of eligible receivables, which funding capacity increases to $400.0 million at certain times of the
year. As of September 29, 2017, $254.2 million was outstanding under our receivables facility.

Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of
% per annum.

Special Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If the AmeriPride Acquisition is not completed on
or prior to April 30, 2018, or if, prior to such date,
the AmeriPride Merger Agreement is terminated,
then in either case we will be required to redeem
all of the notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as
defined below). See “Description of the Notes—
Special mandatory redemption.”

Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured
senior basis by Aramark, the indirect parent
company of the issuer, and each wholly-owned
domestic subsidiary of the issuer that guarantees
our senior secured credit facilities and the
Existing Notes (all subsidiaries that guarantee
the notes, collectively, the “guarantors”). All of
the issuer’s domestic subsidiaries, including
Avendra (and certain of its domestic
subsidiaries) and, following completion of its
acquisition, AmeriPride (and certain of its
domestic subsidiaries), but excluding its
receivables finance subsidiary and certain
immaterial subsidiaries, will be guarantors of the
notes.

After giving effect to the Acquisition Financing
Transactions (but for the avoidance of doubt,
neither the Avendra acquisition nor the
AmeriPride acquisition), our non-guarantor
subsidiaries would have accounted for
$3,854.8 million, or approximately 26.4%, of our


8


-----

sales and $190.4 million, or approximately
23.6%, of our operating income, in each case for
the year ended September 29, 2017, and
$3,356.0 million, or approximately 30.5%, of our
total assets and $1,376.2 million (excluding
intercompany liabilities), or approximately 16.1%,
of our total liabilities, in each case as of
September 29, 2017.

Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be the issuer’s senior unsecured
obligations and:

                             - rank senior in right of payment to its future
debt and other obligations that are, by their
terms, expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the notes;

                             - rank equal in right of payment to all of its
existing and future senior debt, including our
senior secured credit facilities, the Existing
Dollar Notes and its guarantee of the 2025
Euro Notes; and

                              - are effectively subordinated to all of its
existing and future secured debt (including
obligations under our senior secured credit
facilities), to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such debt, and are
structurally subordinated to all of its
obligations of each of its subsidiaries that is
not a guarantor of the notes.

Similarly, each of the subsidiary guarantees will
be a senior unsecured obligation of the
applicable guarantor and:

                             - rank senior in right of payment to all of the
applicable guarantor’s existing and future debt
and other obligations that are, by their terms,
expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the notes;

                             - rank equal in right of payment to all of the
applicable guarantor’s existing and future
senior debt and other obligations that are not,
by their terms, expressly subordinated in right
of payment to the notes, including their
guarantees of the senior secured credit
facilities and the Existing Notes; and

                             - are effectively subordinated to all of the
applicable guarantor’s existing and future
secured debt (including such guarantor’s


9


-----

guarantee under our senior secured credit
facilities), to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such debt, and are
structurally subordinated to all obligations of
any subsidiary of the issuer if that subsidiary
is not a guarantor of the notes, including
Aramark International Finance S.à.r.l., the
issuer of the 2025 Euro Notes.

As of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to
the Acquisition Financing Transactions, (1) the
notes and related subsidiary guarantees would
have ranked effectively junior to approximately
$4,113.8 million of senior secured indebtedness
(including $114.4 million of payment obligations
relating to capital lease obligations and
$254.2 million under our receivables facility), to
the extent of the value of the assets securing
such debt, and (2) we would have had
$948.5 million of unutilized capacity under our
revolving credit facility available to us, all of
which are secured.

Optional redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Prior to, 2023, we may redeem the notes,
in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof plus the makewhole premium described under “Description of
the Notes—Optional redemption,” plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including
the redemption date.

We may also redeem any of the notes at any
time on or after, 2023, in whole or in part,
at the redemption prices described under
“Description of the Notes—Optional redemption,”
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but
not including the redemption date.

In addition, prior to, 2021, we may
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes using the proceeds of
certain equity offerings at a price equal to % of
the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the
redemption date.

Change of control; asset sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we experience specific kinds of changes of
control, we will be required to make an offer to
purchase the notes at a purchase price of 101%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but not including, the
purchase date. If we sell assets under certain


10


-----

circumstances, we will be required to make an
offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price
of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the purchase date. See “Description of
the Notes—Repurchase at the option of holders.”

Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture that will govern the notes restricts
the issuer’s ability and the ability of its restricted
subsidiaries to, among other things:

                            - incur additional indebtedness or issue certain
preferred shares;

                           - pay dividends and make certain distributions,
investments and other restricted payments;

                             - create certain liens;

                             - sell assets;

                              - enter into transactions with affiliates;

                              - limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to
make payments to us;

                           - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

                           - merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of their assets; and

                            - designate the issuer’s subsidiaries as
unrestricted subsidiaries.

These covenants are subject to important
exceptions and qualifications described under
the headings “Description of the Notes.” If the
notes are assigned an investment grade rating
by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”)
and Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”)
and no default has occurred and is continuing,
certain covenants relating to the notes will be
suspended. If either rating should subsequently
decline below investment grade, such
suspended covenants relating to the notes will
be reinstated.

No registration rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We are not required to and do not intend to
register the notes offered hereby for resale under
the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction or offer to exchange the notes
offered hereby for notes registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction.

The notes offered hereby have not been
registered under the Securities Act or the


11


-----

securities laws of any other jurisdiction and are
subject to restrictions on transferability and
resale. The notes may not be offered or sold,
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice
to Investors.”

Absence of public market for the notes . . . . . . . . . . The notes are a new issue of securities and
there is currently no established trading market
for the notes. The initial purchasers have advised
us that they presently intend to make a market in
the notes. However, they are not obligated to do
so, and any market making may be discontinued
without notice. We do not intend to apply for a
listing of the notes on any securities exchange or
an automated dealer quotation system.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the
development or liquidity of any market for the
notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the
notes—Your ability to transfer the notes may be
limited by the absence of an active trading
market, and there is no assurance that an active
trading market will develop for the notes.”

**Use of Proceeds**

We expect to receive aggregate net proceeds of approximately $ million from this offering of
the notes after the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand, to pay the
purchase price for the AmeriPride acquisition, repay $150.0 million of the Amendment No. 2 Revolver
Borrowing and to pay related fees and expenses.

Our revolving credit facility matures on March 28, 2022 and the interest rates applicable to our
revolver borrowings are described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit
Facilities—Interest rate and fees.”

The consummation of this offering is not conditioned upon the prior or substantially concurrent
consummation of the AmeriPride acquisition. If for any reason the AmeriPride acquisition is not
completed on or prior to April 30, 2018, or if, prior to such date, the AmeriPride Merger Agreement is
terminated, then in either case we will be required to redeem the notes as described under “Description
of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption.”

**Risk Factors**

In evaluating an investment in the notes, prospective investors should carefully consider, along
with the other information contained or incorporated in this offering circular, the specific factors set forth
under “Risk Factors” and under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Aramark’s Fiscal 2017 10-K incorporated by
reference herein for risks associated with an investment in the notes.

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information contained in this offering circular and the information_
_incorporated by reference herein, you should carefully consider the following factors before making an_
_investment in the notes offered hereby. In addition to the risk factors set forth below, please read the_
_information included or incorporated by reference under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Aramark’s Fiscal_
_2017 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be_
_immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of_
_operations. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial_
_condition or results of operations. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your original investment._

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations,_**
**_limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industries, expose us to interest rate_**
**_risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations._**

We are highly leveraged. As of September 29, 2017, our aggregate principal amount of
outstanding indebtedness was $5,300.9 million and we had availability of $998.5 million under our
revolving credit facility (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit). As of September 29,
2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, our aggregate principal amount of
outstanding indebtedness would have been $7,652.1 million and we would have had availability of
$948.5 million under our revolving credit facility (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit).

This degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:

   - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including
borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables facility, are at variable
rates of interest;

   - making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;

   - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;

   - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of
principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to
fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

   - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic
divestitures;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt
service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and

   - limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future,
subject to the restrictions contained in the senior secured credit agreement, the indentures governing
the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. If new indebtedness is
added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase.

**_If our financial performance were to deteriorate, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash_**
**_to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our
financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive

15


-----

conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. While we believe
that we currently have adequate cash flows to service our indebtedness, if our financial performance
were to deteriorate significantly, we might be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If, due to such a deterioration in our financial performance, our cash flows and capital resources
were to be insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay
investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or
refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us
to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, if we were required to raise additional
capital in the current financial markets, the terms of such financing, if available, could result in higher
costs and greater restrictions on our business. In addition, none of our significant long-term borrowings
mature prior to 2019, if we were to need to refinance our existing indebtedness, the conditions in the
financial markets at that time could make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness on
acceptable terms or at all. If such alternative measures proved unsuccessful, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt
service and other obligations. The senior secured credit agreement, the indentures governing the
Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby restrict our ability to dispose
of assets and use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and to refinance our indebtedness. We
may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from
them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

The senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain,
and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain, various covenants that limit our
ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted
subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

   - incur additional indebtedness, refinance or restructure indebtedness or issue certain preferred
shares;

   - pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, make
unscheduled payments on our notes, repurchase or redeem our senior notes or make other
restricted payments;

   - make certain investments;

   - sell certain assets;

   - create liens;

   - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and

   - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

In addition, our senior secured revolving credit facility requires us to satisfy and maintain specified
financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests
can be affected by events beyond our control, and in the event of a significant deterioration of our
financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will satisfy those ratios and tests. A breach
of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit agreement. Upon
our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants that is not waived by the lenders under the
revolving credit facility, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could elect to declare all
amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and
terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such facilities. If we were unable to repay

16


-----

those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the
collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our
assets as collateral under the senior secured credit agreement. If the lenders under the senior secured
credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have
sufficient assets to repay those borrowings, as well as our unsecured indebtedness. If our senior
secured indebtedness was accelerated by the lenders as a result of a default, the Existing Notes and
the notes may become due and payable as well. Any such acceleration may also constitute an
amortization event under our receivables facility, which could result in the amount outstanding under
that facility becoming due and payable.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the_**
**_notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our_**
**_indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our
financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive
conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable
to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we
may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek
additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative
measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service
obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity
problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service
and other obligations. The senior secured credit agreement, the indentures governing the Existing
Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will restrict our ability to dispose of
assets, use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and to refinance our indebtedness. We may
not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from
them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

**_Repayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries._**

Our subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our
operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the
generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by
dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, our subsidiaries do
not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose.
Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to
make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal
entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain
cash from our subsidiaries. While the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will limit the
ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In
the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

17


-----

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes is effectively junior to those lenders who have a_**
**_security interest in our assets._**

Our obligations under the notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the
notes are unsecured, but our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and each guarantor’s
obligations under their respective guarantees of the senior secured credit facilities are secured by a
security interest in substantially all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets, including the stock of
most of our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries and the stock of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. If we
are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under the senior secured credit agreement, the
lenders could declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately
due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders could foreclose on the
pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the
indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby at such time. Furthermore, if the lenders foreclose
and sell the pledged equity interests in any subsidiary guarantor under the notes, then that guarantor
will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and immediately upon such sale. In any
such event, because the notes will not be secured by any of our assets or the equity interests in
subsidiary guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from which your claims
could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims fully. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness.”

As of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, our
outstanding secured indebtedness would be $4,113.8 million in aggregate principal amount (including
$114.4 million of payment obligations relating to capital lease obligations and $254.2 million under our
receivables facility) and we would have had unutilized capacity of $948.5 million under our revolving
credit facility available (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit). The indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby will permit us and our restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial
additional indebtedness in the future, including senior secured indebtedness.

**_Claims of noteholders will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of all of our_**
**_non-U.S. subsidiaries and some of our U.S. subsidiaries because they will not guarantee the_**
**_notes._**

The notes will not be guaranteed by any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (including the issuer of the
2025 Euro Notes), our receivables subsidiaries or certain other U.S. subsidiaries. Accordingly, claims
of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these
non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and holders of any indebtedness issued by these
non-guarantor subsidiaries. All obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied
before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or
otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the notes.

After giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions (but for the avoidance of doubt,
neither the Avendra acquisition nor the AmeriPride acquisition), our non-guarantor subsidiaries would
have accounted for $3,854.8 million, or approximately 26.4%, of our sales and $190.4 million, or
approximately 23.6%, of our operating income, in each case for the fiscal year ended September 29,
2017, and $3,356.0 million, or approximately 30.5%, of our total assets and $1,376.2 million (excluding
intercompany liabilities), or approximately 16.1%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of
September 29, 2017.

**_The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the_**
**_guarantors under the senior secured credit agreement in a variety of circumstances, which will_**
**_cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the notes._**

While any obligations under the senior secured credit facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee
of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustee

18


-----

under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, at the discretion of lenders under the
senior secured credit facilities, if the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the
senior secured credit facilities or any other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes.” The lenders
under the senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the
senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor
against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other
liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively
be senior to claims of noteholders.

**_If we do not complete the AmeriPride acquisition on or prior to April 30, 2018, or if, prior to_**
**_such date, the AmeriPride Merger Agreement is terminated, we must redeem the notes and, as_**
**_a result, you may not obtain your expected return on the notes._**

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the purchase price for the
AmeriPride acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The consummation of this offering is not
conditioned upon the prior or substantially concurrent consummation of the AmeriPride acquisition.

Our ability to consummate the AmeriPride acquisition is subject to various conditions, some of
which are beyond our control. We are required to redeem all of the notes in the event that we do not
complete the AmeriPride acquisition on or prior to April 30, 2018, or if, prior to such date, the
AmeriPride Merger Agreement is terminated, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. See
“Description of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption.” If we are required to redeem the notes
pursuant to the redemption provision, you may not obtain your expected return on the notes and may
not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that results in a comparable
return.

Your decision to invest in the notes is made at the time of the offering of the notes. You will have
no rights under the redemption provision described in the immediately preceding paragraph if the
AmeriPride acquisition is completed on or prior to April 30, 2018. You will also not have any right to
require us to redeem your notes if, between the closing of the notes offering and the completion of the
AmeriPride acquisition, we experience any changes in our business or financial condition or if the
terms of the AmeriPride acquisition change.

**_We may not be able to redeem the notes upon a Special Mandatory Redemption Event._**

Upon the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event (as defined in “Description of the
Notes—Special mandatory redemption”), we will be required to redeem each holder’s notes at a
purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
Special mandatory redemption”).

If a Special Mandatory Redemption Event occurs, we may not have sufficient financial resources
available to satisfy our obligations to redeem the notes. In the event we are required to make the
Special Mandatory Redemption Payment (as defined in “Description of Notes—Special mandatory
redemption”), we expect that we would seek third-party financing to the extent we do not have
sufficient funds available to meet our redemption obligations. However, there can be no assurance that
we would be able to obtain such financing. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would be
able to obtain the consents necessary to make the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment from the
lenders under agreements governing outstanding Indebtedness that may in the future prohibit the
Special Mandatory Redemption Payment. Our failure to redeem the notes as required under the
indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby would result in a default thereunder, which could
result in defaults under our and our subsidiaries’ other debt agreements and have material adverse

19


-----

consequences for us and the holders of the notes. See “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory
redemption.” Moreover, if we are required to make a Special Mandatory Redemption Payment, it could
cause a default under our existing or future debt, even if the Special Mandatory Redemption Event
itself does not result in a default under existing or future debt, due to the financial effect of such
redemption on us.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The source of funds for any such purchase of the notes will be cash generated from our subsidiaries’
operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be
able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial
resources to purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Our failure to
repurchase the notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void or limit the amount_**
**_payable under the notes or the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may receive limited or no_**
**_payments on the notes and guarantees affected._**

Federal and state fraudulent conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the
incurrence of the guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state
fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or guarantees
could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (1) we or any of the guarantors, as
applicable, issued the notes or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantees
and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true at the time hereof:

   - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of
the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees;

   - the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left us or any of the guarantors,
as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business;

   - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur
debts beyond our or such guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or

   - we or any of the guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a
judgment for money damages docketed against us or such guarantor if, in either case, after
final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees was a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or
such guarantee or limit the amount of payment or subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently
existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor, or require you to repay any
amounts received. In the event of a finding that fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may
not receive any payment on the notes. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an
obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is
secured or satisfied. Under applicable law, a court may determine that a debtor has not received value
in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend
payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor. We cannot be certain as
to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at

20


-----

the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the notes or the guarantees
would not be voided, limited in amount or subordinated to our or any of our guarantors’ other debt.
Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount
that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent
transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided under
fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that
effectively makes the guarantee worthless.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes under applicable securities_**
**_laws._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under U.S. and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States
only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. and
applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an
indefinite period of time. We are not required to register the notes for resale under the Securities Act or
the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and_**
**_there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the notes._**

The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make
a market in any of the notes, and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time
without notice.

Therefore, we cannot assure you that an active market for any of the notes will develop or, if
developed, that it will continue.

The conditions of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past
and are likely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the
notes. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes.

We cannot assure you that the market, if any, for any of the notes will be free from similar
disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your
notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our
performance and other factors.

21


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering of the notes, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$ million.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand, to pay the
purchase price for the AmeriPride acquisition, repay $150.0 million of the Amendment No. 2 Revolver
Borrowing, which borrowings were incurred to fund a portion of the Term Loan A Repayment, and to
pay related fees and expenses. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Avendra and AmeriPride
Acquisitions—AmeriPride and “Summary—Recent Developments—Avendra and AmeriPride
Acquisitions—Incremental Amendment No. 2 to Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”

Our revolving credit facility matures on March 28, 2022 and the interest rates applicable to our
revolver borrowings are described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Credit
Facilities—Interest rate and fees.”

The consummation of this offering is not conditioned upon the prior or substantially concurrent
consummation of the AmeriPride acquisition. If for any reason the AmeriPride acquisition is not
completed on or prior to April 30, 2018, or if, prior to such date, the AmeriPride Merger Agreement is
terminated, then in either case we will be required to redeem the notes as described under “Description
of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption.”

Services, Inc. and certain foreign borrowers for loans in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and
pounds sterling, with aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement of $1,000 million and a
final maturity date of March 28, 2022. As of September 29, 2017, $998.5 million was available for
borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility. Our existing term loan facilities consist of
various subfacilities denominated in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies. As of September 29,
2017, $2,544.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans were outstanding (recorded at
$2,529.3 million to reflect original issue discount and debt issuance costs), $1,133.3 million
(recorded at $1,125.9 million to reflect original issue discount and debt issuance costs) of which
have a maturity date of March 28, 2022 and $1,410.6 million (recorded at $1,403.4 million to
reflect debt issuance costs) of which have a maturity date of March 28, 2024.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The summaries set forth below are qualified in their entirety by the actual text of the applicable_
_agreements and indentures, each of which has been or will be filed with the SEC and which may be_
_obtained on publicly available websites or at the address set forth under “Available Information.”_

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

**_General_**

Our existing senior secured credit facilities are provided under a credit agreement dated as of
March 28, 2017 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit
Agreement”). The borrowers under our existing senior secured credit facilities are Aramark Services,
Inc. and certain foreign subsidiaries of Aramark Services, Inc.

Our senior secured credit facilities consist of the following facilities:

   - A U.S. dollar denominated term loan B to Aramark Services, Inc. in the amount of
approximately $1,410.6 million, due March 28, 2024 (“U.S. Term B Loan”) and $1,785.0 million,
due March 11, 2025 (“U.S. Term B-1 Loan”),

   - A Canadian dollar denominated term loan to Aramark Canada Ltd. in the amount of
CAD250.1 million, due March 28, 2022 (approximately $200.5 million as of September 29,
2017) (the “Canadian Term Loan”);

   - A yen denominated term loan to Aramark Services, Inc. in the amount of ¥11,051.5 million, due
March 28, 2022 (approximately $98.2 million as of September 29, 2017) (“Yen Term Loan”);

   - A euro denominated term loan to Aramark Investments Limited, a U.K. borrower, in an amount
of €170.0 million, due March 28, 2022 (approximately $200.9 million as of September 29, 2017)
(the “Euro Term Loan”); and

   - A revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) available for loans in U.S. dollars,
Canadian dollars, euros and pounds sterling to Aramark Services, Inc. and certain foreign
borrowers with aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement of $1.0 billion and a final
maturity date of March 28, 2022.

Substantially concurrent with this offering, we intend to amend our Credit Agreement to, among
other things, permit the incurrence of incremental Canadian Term Loan borrowings in an aggregate
principal amount of up to $50.0 million equivalent and use the proceeds therefrom to repay borrowings
under our revolving credit facility. The proposed incremental Canadian Term Loan amendment is
subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance that the amendments will be
completed on the terms contemplated or at all.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus,
at our option, (a) with respect to borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars, Euro, Pounds Sterling and
Yen, a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such
borrowing for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs,
(b) with respect to borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars a base rate determined by reference to the
highest of (1) the prime rate of the administrative agent, (2) 0.50% plus the higher of (A) the federal
funds rate and (B) the overnight bank funding rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York and (3) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% or (c) with respect to borrowings denominated

25


-----

in Canadian Dollars, (1) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (x) the prime rate
announced by the administrative agent or (y) the one-month bankers’ acceptance rate plus 1.00% or
(2) a bankers’ acceptance rate determined by reference to the rate offered for banker’s acceptances in
Canadian Dollars for the interest period relevant to such borrowing.

The applicable margin spread for the U.S. Term B Loan and U.S. Term B-1 Loan is 1.75% to
2.00% (as of September 29, 2017—2.00%) with respect to LIBOR borrowings, subject to a LIBOR floor
of 0.00%, and 0.75% to 1.00% (as of September 29, 2017—1.00%) with respect to base-rate
borrowings, subject to a minimum base rate of 1.00%. The applicable margin spread for the Canadian
Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility is 1.50% to 2.25% (as of September 29, 2017—1.75%)
with respect to LIBOR borrowings and bankers’ acceptance (“BA”) rate borrowings and letters of credit
fees and 0.50% to 1.25% (as of September 29, 2017—0.75%) with respect to U.S. and Canadian base
rate borrowings. The applicable margin for the Yen Term Loan is 1.75%. The applicable margin for the
Euro Term Loan is 1.50%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior
secured credit facilities, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rate ranges
from 0.25% to 0.40% per annum (as of September 29, 2017—0.30%). The actual spreads within all
ranges referred to above are based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) at the end of each fiscal period.

Our Revolving Credit Facility includes a $250.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.

The Credit Agreement provides that we have the right at any time to request one or more
incremental term loan facilities or increases under existing term loan facilities and/or additional
revolving credit facilities or increases under the existing Revolving Credit Facility in an amount up to
$1,400.0 million of incremental commitments in the aggregate plus an unlimited amount so long as the
pro forma ratio of (i) Consolidated Total Secured Indebtedness that is secured by any lien less
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to (ii) Consolidated Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (each as
calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement (the “Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio”)) would
not exceed 3.00 to 1.00, plus any amount of loans and commitments optionally prepaid and terminated
under the senior secured credit facilities. The lenders under the Credit Agreement are not under any
obligation to provide any such incremental facilities or commitments, and any such addition of or
increase in facilities or commitments will be subject to customary conditions precedent. The Revolving
Credit Facility may be drawn by Aramark Services, Inc. as well as by certain foreign subsidiaries of
Aramark Services, Inc. Each currently existing foreign borrower is subject to an individual sublimit of
$150.0 million with respect to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Prepayments and amortization_**

The Credit Agreement requires us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain
exceptions, with:

   - 50% of Aramark Services, Inc.’s annual excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
with stepdowns to 25% and 0% upon Aramark Services, Inc.’s reaching certain Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio thresholds; provided, that (i) such prepayment shall only be required to the
extent excess cash flow for the applicable year exceeds $10.0 million and (ii) such prepayment
shall only be required with respect to the U.S. Term B-1 Loans commencing with the fiscal year
ending 2018;

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds of all nonordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of
property subject to certain exceptions and customary reinvestment rights; provided, that such
prepayment shall only be required to the extent net cash proceeds exceeds $100.0 million; and

26


-----

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, but excluding proceeds from certain
debt permitted under the Credit Agreement.

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied to the term loan facilities on a pro rata
basis and will reduce the obligations to make scheduled amortization payments on a dollar for dollar
basis as directed by us. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement any
time without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR
loans and (ii) with respect to any voluntary prepayments of the U.S. Term B-1 Loan in connection with
any repricing transaction (as defined in the Credit Agreement) effected prior to June 11, 2018, a 1%
prepayment premium. Prepaid term loans may not be reborrowed.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company repaid a U.S. dollar denominated term loan of
a Canadian subsidiary, due July 2016, that had been borrowed under the Company’s senior secured
credit agreement in the amount of $74.1 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company
repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the Term B-1 Loan and borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility, a U.S. dollar denominated term A loan of Aramark Services, Inc., due March 2022, that had
been borrowed under the Company’s senior secured credit agreement in the amount of $650 million.
The Company made optional prepayments of approximately $330.6 million and $160.0 million of
outstanding U.S. dollar term loans, during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.

If a change of control as defined in the Credit Agreement occurs, this will cause an event of
default under the Credit Agreement. Upon an event of default, the senior secured credit facilities may
be accelerated, in which case we would be required to repay all outstanding loans plus accrued and
unpaid interest and all other amounts outstanding under our new senior secured credit facilities under
the Credit Agreement.

We are required to make quarterly principal repayments on the U.S. Term B Loan, the U.S.
Term B-1 Loan and the Yen Term Loan in quarterly amounts of 1.00% per annum of their funded total
principal amount. We are required to make quarterly principal repayments on the Canadian Term Loan
in quarterly amounts of 4.4%, 5.0%, 7.5%, 10.1% and 15.1% per annum of their funded total principal
amount after the anniversary of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth years of the effectiveness of the
Credit Agreement. The Company is required to make quarterly principal repayments on the Euro Term
Loan in quarterly amounts of 5.0%, 6.3%, 8.8%, 12.5% and 15.0% per annum of their funded total
principal amount after the anniversary of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth years of the
effectiveness of the Credit Agreement.

Principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full on
March 28, 2022, on which date the commitments thereunder will terminate.

**_Guarantee and security_**

All obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Aramark
Intermediate HoldCo Corporation and, subject to certain customary exceptions, substantially all of
Aramark Services, Inc.’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries excluding certain
immaterial subsidiaries, receivables facility subsidiaries, certain other customarily excluded

**Receivables Facility**

We have in place an agreement where Aramark Receivables, LLC, a wholly owned, bankruptcyremote subsidiary of Aramark Services, Inc., sells on a continuous basis an undivided interest in

32


-----

eligible accounts receivable generated by certain of our operating subsidiaries and other related assets
to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the Toronto-Dominion Bank and a commercial paper conduit (the
“Commercial Paper Conduit”) sponsored by Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., New York Branch
(“Rabobank”). Aramark Receivables, LLC was formed for the sole purpose of transferring receivables
generated by certain of our subsidiaries. Under this receivables facility, we and certain of our
subsidiaries transfer without recourse all of their accounts receivable to Aramark Receivables, LLC. As
collections reduce previously transferred interests, interests in new, eligible receivables are transferred
to Aramark Receivables, LLC, subject to meeting certain conditions. Our receivables facility provides
for up to $350.0 million of funding, based, in part, on the amount of eligible receivables, which funding
capacity increases to $400.0 million from September to March and May to June. As of September 29,
2017, $254.2 million was outstanding under the receivables facility.

Availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding
accounts receivable balance of our subsidiaries that participate in the facility. Aggregate availability is
determined by using a formula that reduces the gross receivables balance by factors that take into
account, among other things, historical default and dilution rates, excessive obligor concentrations,
average days outstanding and the costs of the facility.

The Commercial Paper Conduit may discontinue funding the receivables facility at any time for
any reason. If it does, Rabobank will be obligated to fund the Commercial Paper Conduit’s proportion
of the receivables facility.

The final maturity of the receivables facility is May 2, 2019. The receivables facility may be
terminated for material breaches of representations and warranties or covenants, bankruptcies of any
seller, the collection agent or the transferor, a change of control or certain cross defaults under our
senior secured credit facilities or other material indebtedness, among other reasons.

**Other Indebtedness**

As of September 29, 2017, we had outstanding $114.4 million of secured debt representing
capital lease obligations. In addition, we had $4.3 million of other indebtedness outstanding at
September 29, 2017, consisting primarily of borrowings by certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

**General**

In this description of the notes, all references to “we,” “us” or “our” and “the Company” are to
Aramark Services, Inc. only (the “Company”) and not to Aramark or any of its Subsidiaries.
References in this description of the notes to Aramark refer only to Aramark and not to its Subsidiaries
or the Company. Although Aramark will guarantee the Notes, it will not be subject to the covenants that
apply to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries under the Notes and references in this description
of the Notes to the Guarantors do not include Aramark.

relating to the parent. Aramark, as parent guarantor, will guarantee the Notes for purposes of financial
reporting, but will not be subject to the covenants that apply to Aramark Services, Inc. or its Restricted

The Company may issue additional Notes under the Indenture from time to time after this offering
subject to the covenant described below under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of

treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase (except in the limited circumstances set forth below under
“—Amendment, supplement and waiver”). Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes”
for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes” include any Additional Notes that

accounts specified by the Holder or Holders thereof. The Notes will be issued in denominations of
$2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.

**Guarantees**

Each direct and indirect Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is a Domestic Subsidiary and
that guarantees the obligations of the Company under the Senior Credit Facilities (which on the Issue
Date will be each Domestic Subsidiary other than Receivables Subsidiaries and certain immaterial

35


-----

subsidiaries) will jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee, as primary obligors and not
merely as sureties, on a senior unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when
due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company under the
Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, or interest on the Notes, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture. None
of our Restricted Subsidiaries that are Foreign Subsidiaries, including Aramark International Finance
S.à r.l., the issuer of the 2025 Euro Notes, or any Receivables Subsidiary and certain immaterial
subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Although Aramark is providing a parent guarantee of the Notes
for purposes of financial reporting, it is not a “Guarantor” and its guarantee is not a “Guarantee,” in
each case as defined in and for purposes of this “Description of the Notes.”

Each Guarantee will be a general unsecured senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor, will
rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and any future Senior Indebtedness of such
Guarantor, will be effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent
of the collateral securing such Indebtedness, and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and
any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor. The Notes will be structurally subordinated
to Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the Company that do not guarantee the Notes. See also “—Brief
description of the notes and the guarantees.”

Each Guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the Guarantor’s liability thereunder to the
maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its Guarantee
to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from
being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that
effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—Federal and
state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void or limit the amount payable under the notes or
the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may receive limited or no payments on the notes and
guarantees affected.”

Each Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell all or substantially all its assets to
(A) the Company or another Guarantor without limitation or (B) any other Person upon the terms and
conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain covenants—Merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all assets.”

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally be released and discharged
upon:

(1) (a) the sale, disposition or other transfer (including through merger or consolidation) of
all of the Capital Stock (or any sale, disposition or other transfer of Capital Stock following which
such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary), or all or substantially all the assets, of such
Guarantor (other than a sale, disposition or other transfer to a Restricted Subsidiary) if such sale,
disposition or other transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(b) the designation by the Company of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture as described under “—Certain
covenants—Limitation on restricted payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted
Subsidiary”;

(c) the release or discharge of such Guarantor from its guarantee of Indebtedness
under the Senior Credit Facilities or the guarantee that resulted in the obligation of such
Guarantor to guarantee the Notes, in each case, if such Guarantor would not then otherwise
be required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
covenants—Limitation on guarantees of indebtedness by restricted subsidiaries,” (treating
any guarantees of such Guarantor that remain outstanding as incurred at least 30 days prior

36


-----

to such release) except, in each case, a release or discharge by, or as a result of, payment
under such guarantee or payment in full of the Indebtedness under the Senior Credit
Facilities; or

(d) the exercise by the Company of its legal defeasance option or its covenant
defeasance option, as described under “—Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance” or if
the Company’s obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture;

(2) in the case of clause (1)(a) above, the release of such Guarantor from its guarantee, if
any, of and all pledges and security, if any, granted in connection with, the Senior Credit Facilities
and any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (except with respect to
a Restricted Subsidiary included in a Designated Business, Indebtedness of a Designated
Business permitted by clause (y) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified and
preferred stock”); and

(3) such Guarantor delivering to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of
counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such
transaction have been complied with.

**Ranking**

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Guarantees will be Senior Indebtedness of the
Company or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, and will rank equal in right of payment with
all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be,
including the Obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities and the
Existing Notes. However, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s and the
Guarantors’ existing and future Secured Indebtedness (including Indebtedness under the Senior Credit
Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness.

As of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, the
Company and its Subsidiaries would have had $7,652.1 million aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness outstanding (excluding unused commitments), including Indebtedness represented by
the Notes offered hereby, $900.0 million of Indebtedness represented by the 2024 Notes,
$600.0 million of Indebtedness represented by the 2025 Dollar Notes, €325.0 million (approximately
$384.0 million as of September 29, 2017) of Indebtedness represented by the 2025 Euro Notes,
$500.0 million of Indebtedness represented by the 2026 Notes, $3,745.2 million of Indebtedness
outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, $254.2 million of Indebtedness outstanding under the
Receivables Facility and $114.4 million of Indebtedness in respect of Capitalized Lease Obligations. In
addition, as of September 29, 2017, after giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions, the
Company and its Subsidiaries would have been able to incur an additional $948.5 million of
Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities.

A significant portion of the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries.
Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries, including trade creditors,
and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company,
including the holders of the Notes. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of
Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of
Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of
Indebtedness by and the issuance of Disqualified Stock and preferred stock of certain of the

37


-----

Company’s Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. See
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and
preferred stock.”

Not all of our Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of September 29, 2017, our non-guarantor
Subsidiaries had $1,376.2 million of total indebtedness and other claims and liabilities (excluding
intercompany liabilities), all of which would have been structurally senior to the Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and other liabilities, including their trade creditors and
holders of their preferred stock, if any, before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us.
After giving effect to the Acquisition Financing Transactions (but for the avoidance of doubt, neither the
Avendra acquisition nor the AmeriPride acquisition), our non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have
accounted for $3,854.8 million, or approximately 26.4%, of our sales and $190.4 million, or
approximately 23.6%, of our operating income, in each case for the year ended September 29, 2017,
and $3,356.0 million, or approximately 30.5%, of our total assets and $1,376.2 million (excluding
intercompany liabilities), or approximately 16.1%, of our total liabilities, in each case as of
September 29, 2017.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such
Indebtedness could be substantial. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
incurrence of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain
covenants—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred
stock.”

**Paying agent and registrar for the notes**

The Company will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes in the Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York. The initial paying agent for the Notes will be the Trustee.

The Company will also maintain a registrar with offices in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New
York. The initial registrar will be the Trustee. The registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership
of the Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Notes
on behalf of the Company.

The Company may change the paying agents or the registrars without prior notice to the Holders.
The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent or registrar.

**Special mandatory redemption**

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the purchase price for the
AmeriPride acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, as described under the heading “Use of
Proceeds.” If the AmeriPride acquisition is not completed on or prior to April 30, 2018, or if, prior to
such date, the AmeriPride Merger Agreement is terminated (each, a “Special Mandatory Redemption
**_Event”), the provisions set forth below will be applicable._**

Upon the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the notes will be redeemed in
whole at a special mandatory redemption price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to
100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal
amount of the notes to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).
Upon the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event, the Company will promptly (but in no
event later than five business days following such Special Mandatory Redemption Event) notify the

38


-----

Trustee in writing of such event, and the Trustee will, no later than five business days following receipt
of such notice from the Company, notify the Holders (such date of notification to the Holders, the
“Redemption Notice Date”), that the notes will be redeemed on the 30th day following the
Redemption Notice Date (such date, the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”), in each case in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture. The Trustee, upon receipt of the notice
specified above, on the Redemption Notice Date will notify each Holder in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture that all of the outstanding notes will be redeemed at the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date automatically and without
any further action by the Holders of the notes. At or prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the
business day immediately preceding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Company will
irrevocably deposit with the Trustee funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for
the notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Payment”). If such deposit is made as provided
above, the notes will cease to bear interest on and after the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

If a Special Mandatory Redemption Event occurs, there can be no assurance that the Company
will have sufficient funds available to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price with respect to the
notes on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. In the event the Company is required to make the
Special Mandatory Redemption Payment, the Company expects that it would seek third-party financing
to the extent it does not have sufficient funds available to meet its redemption obligations. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such financing. In addition, there
can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain the consents necessary to make the
Special Mandatory Redemption Payment from the lenders under agreements governing outstanding
Indebtedness that may in the future prohibit the Special Mandatory Redemption Payment. The failure
to make a Special Mandatory Redemption Payment if and when required would constitute an Event of
Default under the Indenture. See “Risk Factors—We may not be able to redeem the notes upon a
Special Mandatory Redemption Event.”

**Mandatory redemption; offer to purchase; open market purchases**

Other than as described in “—Special mandatory redemption,” the Company will not be required
to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However,
under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described
under “—Repurchase at the option of holders.” The Company may from time to time acquire Notes by
means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, in open market purchases, through
negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws.

**Optional redemption**

Other than as described in “—Special mandatory redemption” and as set forth below, the notes
are not redeemable prior to maturity.

On or after, 2023, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, thereon to but not including the applicable redemption date, subject to the right of Holders of

39

Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

Prior to, 2021, the Company may, at its option, redeem up to 40% of the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of all Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal
to % of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not
including the redemption date, subject to the right of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more
Equity Offerings of the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company to the extent such net
proceeds are contributed to the Company; provided that:

   - at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued under the
Indenture and any Additional Notes that are issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date
remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption; and

   - each such redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of closing of each such Equity
Offering.

At any time prior to, 2023, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to but not including the redemption date, subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering or in connection with a transaction (or series
of related transactions) that constitutes a Change of Control may be given prior to the redemption
thereof.

Any redemption may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a Change of Control, an Equity Offering, other
offering or other corporate transaction or event.

The Company may acquire notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer,
open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities
laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.

**_Selection and notice_**

If the Company is redeeming less than all of the Notes at any time, the Trustee will select the
Notes of such series to be redeemed (a) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in
compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which such Notes
are listed or (b) if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis or by lot or such other method as
may be required by the applicable depository. No Notes of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder at such
Holder’s registered address, except that notices of redemption may be mailed more than 60 days prior

40


-----

to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, any notice of
redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed.

A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Note redeemed in part
will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for
redemption become due and payable on the date fixed for redemption, unless such redemption is
conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company
defaults in the redemption payment, interest shall cease to accrue on the Note or portions thereof
called for redemption.

**Repurchase at the option of holders**

**_Change of control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or concurrently mailed or
transmitted electronically a redemption notice with respect to all outstanding Notes as described under
“—Special mandatory redemption” or “—Optional redemption,” the Company will make an offer to
purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a
price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will send notice of such Change of
Control Offer electronically or by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder to the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register with a copy to the Trustee or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information:

(1) a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this covenant, and all Notes
properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the
Company;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later
than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will
be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase”
on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the
address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding
the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the
Company to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the
close of business on the last day of the offer period, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth
the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement
that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes
purchased;

41


-----

(7) Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in
principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased
portion must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and

(8) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, such notice
shall state that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of
Control and describe such condition, and, if applicable, state that, in the Company’s discretion,
the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, or that such redemption may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change
of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed.

While the Notes are in global form and the Company makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of
the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable
in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent
that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer,

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered, and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been
tendered to and purchased by the Company.

The paying agent will promptly mail to each Holder the Change of Control Payment for such
Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail to each Holder a new Note equal in
principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such
new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Senior Credit Facilities will (subject to limited exceptions), and future credit agreements or
other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may, prohibit the Company from purchasing
any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when
the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of their
lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings and notes that
contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the
Company will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to
purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The Senior Credit Facilities provide that the occurrence of certain change of control events with
respect to the Company (including a Change of Control under the Indenture) constitute a default
thereunder. If the Company experiences a change of control that triggers a default under the Senior

42


-----

Credit Facilities or cross-defaults under any other Indebtedness or the Receivables Facility, the
Company could seek a waiver of such defaults or seek to refinance the Indebtedness outstanding
under the Senior Credit Facilities and such other Indebtedness. In the event the Company does not
obtain such a waiver or refinance the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities and
such other Indebtedness, such defaults could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facilities and such other Indebtedness being declared due and payable and cause the Receivables
Facility to be wound down. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the
occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be
no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a
change of control.”

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the time and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control
at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more
difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the
Company and the Initial Purchasers. We have no current intention to engage in a transaction involving
a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the
limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or
otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock.” Such restrictions
can be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may
require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of
Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Notes.

43


-----

**_Asset sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, cause, make or suffer to exist an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith
by the Company) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor
received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of
cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet of the
Company or in the footnotes thereto) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, other
than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are assumed by the
transferee of any such assets (or a third party on behalf of the transferee) and for which the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has been validly released by all creditors,

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) within 180 days following
the closing of such Asset Sale, and

(c) any Designated Noncash Consideration received by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause
(c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $300.0 million and (y)
3.0% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration,
with the fair market value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being
measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value,
shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

Within 450 days after any of the Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net
Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may, at its option, apply the
Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale:

(1) to permanently reduce (a) Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness of the Company
or any Guarantor (other than Obligations owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) and,
in the case of Obligations under revolving credit facilities or other similar Indebtedness, to
correspondingly permanently reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided that if the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce Obligations under any Senior
Indebtedness that is not secured by a Lien permitted by the Indenture, the Company or such
Guarantor will, equally and ratably, reduce Obligations under the Notes by, at its option,
(i) redeeming Notes, (ii) making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an
Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount of Notes to be
repurchased or (iii) purchasing Notes through open market purchases (to the extent such
purchases are at a price equal to or higher than 100% of the principal amount thereof) in a
manner that complies with the Indenture and applicable securities law or (b) Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or
another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(2) to make (a) an investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such
investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business

44


-----

such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) an investment in properties, (c) capital
expenditures and (d) acquisitions of other assets, that in each of (a), (b), (c) and (d), are used or
useful in the business of the Company and in Restricted Subsidiaries or replace the businesses,
properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale.

Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale that are not invested or applied in accordance with the
preceding paragraph within 450 days from the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds will be deemed
to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that if during such 450-day period the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary enters into a definitive binding agreement committing it to apply such Net
Proceeds in accordance with the requirements of clause (2) of the immediately preceding paragraph
after such 450th day, such 450-day period will be extended with respect to the amount of Net Proceeds
so committed until such Net Proceeds are required to be applied in accordance with such agreement
(but such extension will in no event be for a period longer than 180 days) (or, if earlier, the date of
termination of such agreement). When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
$100.0 million, the Company shall make an offer to all Holders and, if required by the terms of any
Senior Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (other than with respect to Hedging
Obligations) (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes
and such Senior Indebtedness that is a minimum of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Company
will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the
date that Excess Proceeds exceed $100.0 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms
of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with
respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such
Net Proceeds prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days or with respect to Excess Proceeds of
$100.0 million or less.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Senior Indebtedness tendered
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained
in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Senior Indebtedness surrendered by
such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select or cause to
be selected the Notes and such Senior Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the
accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Senior Indebtedness tendered. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds related to such Asset Sale
Offer shall be reset at zero.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Company or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness
outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not
prohibited by the Indenture.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable
in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The Senior Credit Facilities limit (in each case, subject to limited exceptions), and future credit
agreements or other agreements to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary becomes a party

45


-----

may effectively limit or prohibit, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from purchasing any Notes
as a result of an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Company is required to make an Asset Sale Offer at
a time when the Company is actually or effectively prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company
or the Restricted Subsidiary could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes
or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company or the
Restricted Subsidiary does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will
remain actually or effectively prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s
failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent
of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. During any period
of time that (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default
has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”) then,
the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of notes” section of
this offering circular will not be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Repurchase at the option of holders—Asset sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on restricted payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and
preferred stock”;

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially
all assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on line of business.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company may not
designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the second sentence of the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the
Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the
“Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or
downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the
Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the
Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the
Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a
Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Proceeds shall be reset to
zero.

-----

In addition, during any Suspension Period, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not
be subject to the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the option of holders—Change of
control”; provided that for purposes of determining the applicability of this covenant, the Reversion
Date shall be defined as the date that (a) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment
Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating and/or
(b) the Company or any of its Affiliates enter into an agreement to effect a transaction that would result
in a Change of Control and one or more of the Rating Agencies indicate that if consummated, such
transaction (alone or together with any related recapitalization or financing transactions) would cause
such Rating Agency to withdraw its Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the ratings assigned to the
Notes below an Investment Grade Rating. On and after the Reversion Date as defined with respect to
the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the option of holders—Change of control,” the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the such covenant under
the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to a proposed transaction described in clause
(b) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted
to be taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give
rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that
(1) with respect to Restricted Payments made after such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted
Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described above under the caption
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on restricted payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during,
the Suspension Period; and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the
Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (e) of the
second paragraph of “—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock
and preferred stock.” In addition, for purposes of clause (3) of the first paragraph under the caption
“—Limitation on restricted payments,” all events set forth in such clause (3) occurring during a
Suspension Period shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of Restricted
Payments the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is permitted to make pursuant to such clause (3).

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**_Limitation on restricted payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of the Company’s or
any Restricted Subsidiary’s Equity Interests, including any dividend or distribution payable in
connection with any merger or consolidation, other than:

(A) dividends or distributions by the Company payable in Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the Company; or

(B) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any
dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by
a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in
accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

(2) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests
of the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company, including in connection with any

purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final
maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase or
acquisition; or

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above (other than any
exception thereto) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such
Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence
thereof;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Company

succeeding paragraph (and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all other Restricted Payments
made pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

accounting period) from December 31, 2010 to the end of the Company’s most recently

deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; plus

(2) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined
in good faith by the Company, of marketable securities or other property received by the
Company after March 7, 2013 (less the amount of such net cash proceeds to the extent
such amount has been relied upon to permit the incurrence of Indebtedness, or issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (v)(ii) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of
disqualified stock and preferred stock”) from the issue or sale, in each case after March 7,
2013, of:

aggregate amount received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in cash and the fair
market value, as determined in good faith by the Company, of marketable securities or other
property received after March 7, 2013 by means of:

(A) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary) of Restricted Investments made by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the

(B) the sale (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the Equity
Interests of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution or dividend from an
Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the extent the Investment in such
Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
pursuant to clause (9) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such
Investment constituted a Permitted Investment); plus

(5) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary after March 7, 2013, the fair market value of the Investment in such Unrestricted
Subsidiary, as determined by the Company in good faith (or if such fair market value
exceeds $150.0 million, in writing by an Independent Financial Advisor), at the time of the
redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, other than to the
extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (9) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the
extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment.

As of September 29, 2017, we had an estimated capacity to make Restricted Payments in the
amount of approximately $1,380.7 million under this clause (c).

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The
Company will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except
pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of
designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so
designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the last
sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted
Payment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant or under clause (9) or (16), or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” and if
such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed
Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (17) above or is
entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company will be entitled to
classify or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such
Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1) through (17) and such first paragraph
in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

otherwise (collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness), and the Company will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock
and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock; provided that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue
shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including

(y) Indebtedness of a Designated Business which Indebtedness is incurred substantially
concurrently with the disposition of such Designated Business pursuant to clause (18) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on restricted payments” and
which Indebtedness is non-recourse to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries other than
any Restricted Subsidiary included in such Designated Business.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) at any time meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (a) through (x) above
or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole
discretion, will classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) and will only be required to include the
amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in one or more of the
above clauses at such time; provided that all Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facilities on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the
exception in clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Debt.

The accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Any Refinancing
Indebtedness and any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses
(a) and (v) above shall be deemed to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock incurred to pay premiums (including reasonable tender premiums), defeasance costs, fees and
expenses in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the
incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated
in a foreign currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of
revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to extend, replace, refund,
refinance, renew or defease other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such
extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or defeasance would cause the applicable
U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date of such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or defeasance,
such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed or defeased.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to extend, replace, refund, refinance, renew
or defease other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being
extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed or defeased, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing,
renewal or defeasance.

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly
or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in
right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless
such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s
Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other
Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be.

59


-----

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to
any other Senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same
collateral.

**_Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures obligations under any
Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Company or any Guarantor now owned or hereafter
acquired, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income
therefrom, unless:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes or the applicable
Guarantee of a Guarantor, as the case may be, are secured by a Lien on such property or assets
that is senior in priority to such Liens; and

(2) in all other cases, the Notes or the applicable Guarantee of a Guarantor, as the case
may be, are equally and ratably secured or are secured by a Lien on such assets or property that
is senior in priority to such Lien; provided that any Lien which is granted to secure the Notes
under this covenant shall be discharged at the same time as the discharge of the Lien (other than
through the exercise of remedies with respect thereto) that gave rise to the obligation to so
secure the Notes.

**_Limitation on sale and lease-back transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and
Lease-Back Transaction with respect to any property unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to (A) incur Indebtedness
in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale and Lease-Back
Transaction pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on incurrence of
indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock” and (B) create a Lien on
such property securing such Attributable Debt without equally and ratably securing the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Liens”;

(2) the consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction is at least equal to the fair market value (as
determined in good faith by the Company) of such property; and

(3) the Company applies the proceeds of such transaction in compliance with the terms
described under “—Repurchase at the option of holders—Asset sales.”

**_Merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets_**

The Company may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the
Company is the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is a corporation organized or
existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof, the District of
Columbia, or any territory thereof (the Company or such Person, as the case may be, being
herein called the “Successor Company”);

60


-----

(2) the Successor Company, if other than the Company, expressly assumes all the
obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental
indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing
transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four quarter
period,

(A) the Successor Company would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first
sentence of the covenant described under “—Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and
issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock,” or

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company, the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis would be greater than such ratio for the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, in which
case clause (A)(2) of the second succeeding paragraph shall apply, shall have by supplemental
indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes; and

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion
of counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the disposition of a Designated Business
pursuant to clause (18) of the covenant described under “—Limitation on restricted payments” or the
covenant described under “—Repurchase at the option of holders—Asset sales,” shall not be deemed
to be a sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Company will succeed to,
and be substituted for, the Company under the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing
clauses (3) and (4),

(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to, the Company, and

(b) the Company may merge with an Affiliate of the Company incorporated solely for the
purpose of reincorporating the Company in another state of the United States of America or the
District of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon
the sale, disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, each Guarantor will not, and the Company will not
permit any Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such
Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person
unless:

(A) (1) such Guarantor is the surviving entity or the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a

61


-----

corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or
existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof, the District of
Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be,
being herein called the “Successor Person”);

(2) the Successor Person, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all
the obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s
Guarantee, pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and
an opinion of counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; or

(B) the transaction is made in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Repurchase at the option of holders—Asset sales.”

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to,
and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantor may merge into or transfer all or part of its properties
and assets to another Guarantor or the Company.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the
Company which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Company.

**_Transactions with affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any payment to, or
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property
or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding,
loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (each of the
foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of
$20.0 million, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the
Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person;
and

(b) the Company delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of
$50.0 million, a Board Resolution adopted by the majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officers’
Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

each case, approved by the Company in good faith;

Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms of, any stockholders agreement or its equivalent

(13) restrictions or conditions contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction,
service, supply, purchase or other agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of business; provided that such
agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject of such agreement, the payment rights arising
thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of any other Restricted
Subsidiary;

(14) agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
provisions of the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on incurrence of
indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock”; provided that the
restrictions therein either (i) are not materially more restrictive taken as a whole than those
contained in agreements governing Indebtedness in effect on the Issue Date, or (ii) are not
materially more disadvantageous to holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable
financings (as determined by the Company in good faith) and in the case of (ii) such
encumbrances or restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in respect of payment
or a financial maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness;

(15) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and
(c) above imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or
obligations referred to in clauses (1) through (14) above; provided that such amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Company, not materially more restrictive with
respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions than those prior to such amendment,
modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing;
_provided, further, that with respect to contracts, instruments or obligations existing on the Issue_
Date, any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,

-----

refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive with respect to such
encumbrances and other restrictions than those contained in such contracts, instruments or
obligations as in effect on the Issue Date; and

(16) any encumbrances or restrictions contained in Indebtedness permitted to be incurred
pursuant to clause (y) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock” that apply only
to a Designated Business.

**_Limitation on guarantees of indebtedness by restricted subsidiaries_**

The Company will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted
Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries guarantee
other capital markets debt securities), other than a Guarantor or a Foreign Subsidiary, to guarantee the
payment of any Indebtedness of the Company or any other Guarantor unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days executes and delivers a supplemental
indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that
with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, that is by its
express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, any
such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes;

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take
the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other
rights against the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by
such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee; and

(3) such Restricted Subsidiary shall deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect
that:

(a) such Guarantee has been duly executed and authorized; and

(b) such Guarantee constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such
Restricted Subsidiary, except insofar as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar laws (including all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and except
insofar as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity;

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that_
existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection
with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on line of business_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will not fundamentally and substantially alter the character of their business, taken as a whole, from the
business conducted by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on the Issue
Date. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, none of (i) the expansion of the professional
services provided by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date or (ii) the
disposition of a Designated Business pursuant to clause (18) of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on restricted payments” or the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the option of
holders—Asset sales” will be deemed a fundamental and substantial alteration for purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence.

66


-----

**_Reports and other information_**

Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided
for such annual and quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the
Indenture will require the Company to file with the SEC (and make available to the Trustee and Holders
of the Notes (without exhibits), without cost to any Holder, within 15 days after it files (or is otherwise
required to file) them with the SEC) from and after the Issue Date,

(1) within 90 days (or any other time period then in effect under the rules and regulations of
the Exchange Act with respect to the filing of a Form 10-K by a non-accelerated filer) after the
end of each fiscal year, annual reports on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form,
containing the information required to be contained therein, or required in such successor or
comparable form;

(2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year,
reports on Form 10-Q containing all quarterly information that would be required to be contained
in Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form; and

(3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein
reported, such other reports on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable form,

in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such
form; provided that the Company shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC
does not permit such filing, in which event the Company will make available such information to
prospective purchasers of Notes, in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and the
Holders of the Notes, in each case within 15 days after the time the Company would be required to file
such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In addition, to
the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will agree that, for so long as any Notes are
outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their
request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in
this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Company by furnishing financial
information relating to Aramark (or another direct or indirect parent that guarantees the Notes);
_provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail_
the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information
relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand.

Aramark as parent guarantor will guarantee the Notes for purposes of financial reporting. The
Company will be deemed to have furnished the reports required under this covenant if Aramark (or
another direct or indirect parent that guarantees the Notes) has filed such reports with the SEC via the
EDGAR (or successor) filing system and such reports are publicly available.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed
to comply with any of its agreements hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “Events of default and
remedies” until 120 days after the date any report hereunder is required to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to this covenant.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section and
such information is subsequently provided, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its delivery
obligations with respect to its delay in delivery at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall
be deemed to have been cured.

67


-----

**Events of default and remedies**

The following events will constitute Events of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption (including on the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, as applicable), acceleration or otherwise, of payments of principal
of, or premium, if any, on the Notes issued under the Indenture;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the
Notes issued under the Indenture;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given
by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
issued under the Indenture to comply with any of its agreements (other than a default referred to
in clauses (1) and (2) above) in the Indenture or the Notes;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by
which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary,
whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes,
if both:

(A) such default either:

(i) results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or

(ii) relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such
Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such
Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity;
and

(B) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregate $100.0 million or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that
together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments or orders for the
payment of money in an aggregate amount exceeding $100.0 million (to the extent not covered
by independent third-party insurance as to which the insurer has been notified of such judgment
or order and has not denied coverage, it being understood for purposes of the Indenture that the
issuance of reservation of rights letter will not be considered a denial of coverage) and such
judgment or order shall not have been satisfied, vacated, discharged or stayed or bonded
pending an appeal for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary); or

(7) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect
or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of any Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its
Guarantee or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture
or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

68


-----

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest
and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture to be
due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest on
the Notes will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event
of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will
become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may
withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of
principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes if it determines that withholding notice is in
their interest. In addition, the Trustee will have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the best
judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not in the best interests of the Holders of such Notes.

The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes issued thereunder by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all of
such Notes, waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture, except a continuing
Default in the payment of principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any such Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event
of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a
result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded automatically and without
any action by the Trustee or the Holders if, within 20 days after such Event of Default arose,

(x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged,

(y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the
case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default, or

(z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Except to enforce the right to receive payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The Indenture will provide that the Company will be required to deliver to the Trustee annually a
statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company will be required, within five
Business Days, upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying
such Default.

69


-----

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor
(other than in the case of stockholders of any Guarantor, the Company or another Guarantor) or any of
their parent companies shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or the Guarantors
under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance**

The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged
with respect to the Notes issued under the Indenture and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged
with respect to its Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default except
for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture to receive payments in respect
of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due
solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to Notes issued under the Indenture concerning
issuing temporary notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and
the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in
trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company’s
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and
those of each Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not
constitute a Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain
events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the
Company) described under “—Events of default and remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes
issued under the Indenture:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the
Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts
as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes issued under
the Indenture on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such
principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, and the Company must specify whether such
Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
opinion of counsel in the United States of America reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the United States
Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

70


-----

(B) since the original issuance of the Notes, there has been a change in the applicable
U.S. Federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel in the United States of
America shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee
an opinion of counsel in the United States of America reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had
not occurred;

(4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each
case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the
date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under any of the Senior Credit Facilities or any other material
agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which, the Company or any Guarantor is a
party or by which the Company or any Guarantor is bound;

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the
United States of America and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that, as of the
date of such opinion and subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, following the deposit,
the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally under any applicable U.S.
Federal or state law, and that the Trustee has a perfected security interest in such trust funds for
the ratable benefit of the Holders;

(7) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or
defrauding any creditors of the Company, or any Guarantor or others; and

(8) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion
of counsel in the United States of America and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee (which
opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all
conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued
thereunder, when either:

(a) all such Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed
Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore
been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

71


-----

(b) (1) all such Notes not theretofore delivered to such Trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will
become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in
the name, and at the expense, of the Company and the Company or any Guarantor has
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with such Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for
the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof,
in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest to pay
and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be;

(2) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make
such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and,
in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith) with respect to the Indenture or
the Notes issued thereunder shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach
or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Senior Credit Facilities or any other
agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which the
Company or any Guarantor is bound;

(3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the
Indenture; and

(4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of such Notes at maturity or
the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the
Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Transfer and exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or
permitted by the Indenture. The Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption. Also, the Company is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of
15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.

The registered Holder of a Note may be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Amendment, supplement and waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any related Guarantee
and the Notes issued thereunder may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of
at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and issued under the Indenture,
including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes issued
thereunder may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture, including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes, in each case other than Notes beneficially
owned by the Company or its Affiliates.

72


-----

The Indenture provides that, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Notes issued under the Indenture and held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or
waive the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to
the covenants described above under “—Repurchase at the option of holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes
issued under the Indenture, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision
contained in the Indenture or any Guarantee that cannot be amended or modified without the
consent of all Holders;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults
or the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the
Notes;

(7) make any change in the ranking of the Indenture or the Notes that would adversely
affect the Holders;

(8) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantee of any Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiaries that together would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) in
any manner adverse to the Holders;

(9) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions; or

(10) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, or interest on, such
Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any
payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, any Guarantor
(with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the
Indenture, any Guarantee or the Notes:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and
to provide for the assumption of the Company’s, or any Guarantor’s obligations to Holders in
connection therewith;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(5) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Company or a Guarantor;

(6) [reserved];

(7) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof;

73


-----

(8) [reserved];

(9) to add a Guarantor or other guarantor under the Indenture;

(10) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of
this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes”
was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Guarantees or the
Notes; or

(11) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Notes; provided, however, that (a) compliance with the Indenture as so amended
would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
securities law and (b) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of
Holders to transfer Notes.

The consent of the Holders will not be necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made
and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after
mailing.

**Concerning the trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage
in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within
90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes issued thereunder will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The
Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee
will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the
conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such
Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense.

**Governing law**

The Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York.

**Certain definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. Reference is made to the

“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the ratio of
EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of such Person for such period. In the
event that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems, retires or
extinguishes any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred under any revolving credit facility
that has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the
calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”), then the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption,
guarantee, redemption, retirement or extinguishing of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
four-quarter period (the “reference period”); provided that, for purposes of the foregoing calculation, in
the event that the Company shall classify Indebtedness Incurred on the date of determination as
incurred in part pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—
Limitation on incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of disqualified stock and preferred stock” and/or
clause (p) of such covenant (other than by reason of subclause (1)(B) of the proviso to such clause (p))
and in part pursuant to one or more other clauses of the second paragraph of such covenant (as
provided in the third paragraph of such covenant), “Fixed Charges” shall exclude any Fixed Charges
attributable to any such Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one or more such other clauses of such
second paragraph, and shall not give effect to any repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or
other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness from the proceeds thereof.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed operations (as determined in accordance with
GAAP) that have been made by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary during the four quarter
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the
Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments,
acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed operations (and the change in any
associated fixed charges and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day
of the reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person (that subsequently became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the
beginning of such period) shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
consolidation or disposed operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition,
then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such
period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation or disposed operation had
occurred at the beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Company. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had
been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable
to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an
interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to

86


-----

be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving
credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance
of such Indebtedness during the applicable period. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank
offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if
none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

“Trustee” means U.S. Bank National Association until a successor replaces it and, thereafter,

“Unrestricted Subsidiary” means:

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

_Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any_
_offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the notes offered hereby._

Each purchaser of the notes offered hereby will be deemed to have represented and agreed as
follows (terms used herein that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S are used herein as defined
therein):

You (A) (i) are a qualified institutional buyer, (ii) are aware that the sale of the notes to you
is being made in reliance on Rule 144A and (iii) are acquiring such notes for your own account or
for the account of a qualified institutional buyer, as the case may be, or (B) are not a U.S. person,
as such term is defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act, and are purchasing the notes in
accordance with Regulation S.

You understand that the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may
not be reoffered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred except (A) (i) to a person who you
reasonably believe is a qualified institutional buyer acquiring for its own account or the account of
a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (ii) in an
offshore transaction complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S, (iii) pursuant to an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act, other than as provided by Rule 144
thereunder (even if available), (iv) to an institutional investor that is an accredited investor within
the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act (“Regulation D”) in a
transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act and (B) in accordance with all applicable
securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

The notes will bear a legend to the following effect, unless we determine otherwise in
compliance with applicable law:

THE NOTES EVIDENCED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) AND MAY NOT BE
OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (A) (1) TO A
PERSON WHO THE SELLER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
PURCHASING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER IN A TRANSACTION MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE
144A, (2) IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION COMPLYING WITH RULE 903 OR RULE 904 OF
REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (3) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OTHER THAN AS PROVIDED BY RULE 144
THEREUNDER (EVEN IF AVAILABLE), (4) TO AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR THAT IS AN
ACCREDITED INVESTOR WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 501 OF REGULATION D UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT IN A TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OR (5) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND (B) IN ACCORDANCE
WITH ALL APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE STATES OF THE UNITED STATES AND
OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

The notes evidenced hereby will not be transferable pursuant to Rule 144, even if available.

The notes will be available initially only in book-entry form. The notes will be issued in the form of one
or more global notes bearing the legend set forth above.

101


-----

**BOOK-ENTRY SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE**

The certificates representing the notes offered hereby will be issued in fully registered form
without interest coupons. Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act initially will be
represented by permanent global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a
“Restricted Global Note”) and will be deposited with the trustee as a custodian for DTC, as depositary,
and registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary.

Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be
represented by global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Regulation S
Global Notes”) and will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and
registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary. The Regulation S Global Notes will be
exchangeable for one or more permanent global notes. Prior to the 40th day after the later of the
commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including such
40th day, the “distribution compliance period”), a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Restricted Global
Note only upon receipt by the trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect that such
transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional
buyer (“QIB”), in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a
Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a
Regulation S Global Note whether before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the trustee of a
written certification to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S.

The Restricted Global Notes (and the Regulation S Global Notes (collectively, the “Global
Notes”)) (and any notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer
set forth therein and in the indenture and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth
under the heading “Notice to Investors” herein. QIBs or non-U.S. purchasers may elect to take a
Certificated Security (as defined below under “—Certificated securities”) instead of holding their
interests through the Global Notes, which certificated notes will be ineligible to trade through DTC
(collectively referred to herein as the “Non-Global Purchasers”) only in the limited circumstances
described below. Upon the transfer to a QIB of any Certificated Security initially issued to a Non-Global
Purchaser, such Certificated Security will, unless the transferee requests otherwise or the Global Notes
have previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated Securities, be exchanged for an interest in
the Global Notes. For a description of the restrictions on transfer of Certificated Securities and any
interest in the Global Notes, see “Notice to Investors.”

**The Global Notes**

We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (a) upon the issuance of the Global
Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the
individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons
who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (b) ownership of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through,
records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of
participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be
designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may
hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or
indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system.

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such
nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by

102


-----

such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global
Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to
those provided for under the indenture with respect to the notes.

Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made
to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the issuer, the
trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if
any) and interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as
shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners
of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing
instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the
responsibility of such participants.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s
same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder
requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global
Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the
indenture.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at
the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which
such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of
default under the indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will
distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Notice to
Investors.”

DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under
New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York
Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of
Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and
non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC.

DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities
transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges
between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also
available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in
the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and
such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the trustee or any paying agent will

103


-----

have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Securities**

A Global Note is exchangeable for certificated notes in fully registered form without interest
coupons (“Certificated Securities”) only in the following limited circumstances:

   - DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Note and
we fail to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such notice, or

   - there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default with respect to the Notes under
the indenture and DTC shall have requested the issuance of Certificated Securities.

Certificated Securities may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless
the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
notes. See “Notice to Investors.” In no event shall the Regulation S Global Note be exchanged for
Certificated Securities prior to (a) the expiration of the distribution compliance period and (b) the receipt
of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S.

The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of
securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer the notes will be limited to such extent.

**Exchanges Between Regulation S Global Notes and Restricted Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Note only
if:

(a) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A;
and

(b) the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a person:

(i) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer
within the meaning of Rule 144A;

(ii) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional
buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(iii) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the
United States and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the
distribution compliance period, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in
the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available).

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and
the Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the
trustee through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any
such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the

104


-----

Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted
Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon
transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global
Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures
applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.
The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Global Note prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period.

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes. This summary deals only with notes that are

more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or
(ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be
treated as a United States person.

If any entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds notes,
the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the
notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the
United States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:

   - a dealer in securities or currencies;

   - a financial institution;

   - a tax-exempt entity;

   - a person subject to the alternative minimum tax;

   - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity);

   - a “controlled foreign corporation”;

   - a “passive foreign investment company”;

   - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the
notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

   - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings
and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a
retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different
from those summarized below. We have not sought and do not expect to seek any rulings from the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no
assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership or disposition of the notes that are different from those discussed below.

-----

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income and
estate tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the
effects of any United States federal tax laws other than income and estate taxes (such as gift taxes or
the Medicare tax on certain investment income) and does not address state, local or non-United States
tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any
particular purchaser of notes.

If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors
concerning the United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other
United States federal tax laws and/or the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, United States federal
withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the “portfolio interest rule,”
provided that:

   - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business
in the United States;

   - you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of
all classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States
Treasury regulations;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us within the meaning of the Code;

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Code; and

   - either (1) you provide your name and address on an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or other
applicable form), and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person
as defined under the Code or (2) you hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries
and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations.
Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather than
corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be
subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding
agent with a properly executed:

   - IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or other applicable form) certifying an
exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty;
or

   - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not
subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
business in the United States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income
Tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any gain that you realize
on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note.

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is
effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable

107


-----

income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment), then you will be subject
to United States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis in generally the same
manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you are a
foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower applicable
income tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. If
interest received with respect to the notes is effectively connected income (whether or not a treaty
applies), the 30% withholding tax described above will not apply, provided the certification
requirements discussed above in “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, any gain recognized on the
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be
subject to United States federal income tax unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent
establishment), in which case such gain will be subject to United States federal income tax
(and possibly branch profits tax) in generally the same manner as effectively connected interest
is taxed (as discussed above); or

   - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year of the disposition, and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, you will be subject to a flat 30% United States
federal income tax on the gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition, which may
be offset by certain United States source capital losses.

**_United States Federal Estate Tax_**

If you are an individual who is neither a citizen nor a resident (as specifically defined for United
States federal estate tax purposes) of the United States at the time of your death, your estate will not
be subject to United States federal estate tax on notes beneficially owned (or deemed to be beneficially
owned) by you at the time of your death, provided that any interest payment to you on the notes would
be eligible for exemption from the 30% United States federal withholding tax under the “portfolio
interest rule” described above under “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” without regard to the
statement requirement described in the fifth bullet point of that section.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Generally, the amount of interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect
to those payments will be reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest
payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which
you reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on
the notes that are made to you provided that the applicable withholding agent has received from you
the required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder described above in the fifth bullet point under
“—United States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the
proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of notes within
the United States or conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless
you certify to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S.
holder, or you otherwise establish an exemption.

108


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Additional Withholding Requirements_**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as
“FATCA”), a 30% United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest income paid on the
notes and, for a disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note occurring after
December 31, 2018, the gross proceeds from such disposition, in each case paid to (i) a “foreign
financial institution” (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide sufficient
documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or
(y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of
compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids
withholding, or (ii) a “nonfinancial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not
provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption
from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners
of such entity (if any). The foregoing rules generally will apply whether the foreign financial institution or
nonfinancial foreign entity is the beneficial owner of the notes or an intermediary. If an interest payment
is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under
“—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and
therefore reduce, such other withholding tax. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding
these rules and whether they may be relevant to your ownership and disposition of the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of
the notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws, rules or regulations
that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities
whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such plans, accounts and
arrangements (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions
involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and
the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of
such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who
renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers nor any of their
respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to acquire notes and
is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with
respect to such decision. The decision to acquire notes must be made by each prospective Plan
purchaser on an arm’s length basis. In addition, each ERISA Plan acquiring notes must generally be
represented by a fiduciary independent of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates (which may not be an owner of, or a relative of an owner of, an IRA, in the case of an investor
that is an IRA) that (i) is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with
regard to the prospective investment in the notes, (ii) has exercised independent judgment in
evaluating whether to invest the assets of such ERISA Plan in the notes and (iii) is a bank, an
insurance carrier, a registered investment adviser, a registered broker-dealer or an independent
fiduciary with at least $50 million of assets under management or control.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within
the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code,
unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a
non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. The acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the Initial
Purchasers are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct

110


-----

or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless
the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual
prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the United States Department of Labor has issued
prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the
notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE
95-60, respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions
determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor
any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or
render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction
and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate
consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions
of any of the foregoing exemptions will be satisfied.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note or any interest therein, each purchaser and subsequent
transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets
used by such purchaser or transferee to purchase or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes
the assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase and holding of the notes (or any interest therein) by such
purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

Additionally, if any purchaser or subsequent transferee of the notes is using assets of any ERISA
Plan to acquire and hold the notes, such purchaser or subsequent transferee will be deemed to
represent that (i) none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates has
acted as the ERISA Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the
purchaser’s or transferee’s decision to acquire and hold the notes and none of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates shall at any time be relied upon as the ERISA Plan’s
fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold or transfer the notes and (ii) the
decision to invest in the notes has been made at the recommendation or direction of an “independent
fiduciary” (“Independent Fiduciary”) within the meaning of U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-21(c), as amended from time to time (the “Fiduciary Rule”) who (a) is independent of
the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and any of their respective affiliates; (b) is capable of evaluating
investment risks independently, both in general and with respect to particular transactions and
investment strategies (within the meaning of the Fiduciary Rule); (c) is a fiduciary (under ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to the purchaser’s or transferee’s investment in the notes and
is responsible for exercising independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the notes; (d) is not
an IRA owner or a relative of an IRA owner (in the case of an IRA); (e) is either (A) a bank as defined
in Section 202 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”) or similar
institution that is regulated and supervised and subject to periodic examination by a state or federal
agency of the United States; (B) an insurance carrier which is qualified under the laws of more than
one state of the United States to perform the services of managing, acquiring or disposing of assets of
such an ERISA Plan; (C) an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act or, if not registered
as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act by reason of paragraph (1) of Section 203A of the
Advisers Act, is registered as an investment adviser under the laws of the state (referred to in such
paragraph (1)) in which it maintains its principal office and place of business; (D) a broker-dealer
registered under the Exchange Act; or (E) an Independent Fiduciary (not described in clauses (A), (B),

111


-----

(C) or (D) above) that holds or has under management or control total assets of at least $50 million;
and (f) is aware of and acknowledges that (I) none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers nor any of their
respective affiliates is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a
fiduciary capacity, in connection with the purchaser’s or transferee’s investment in the notes, and
(II) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have a financial interest in the
purchaser’s or transferee’s investment in the notes on account of the commissions, discounts, fees and
other remuneration they expect to receive in connection with transactions contemplated hereunder.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering
purchasing or holding the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel
regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such
transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes.

The Initial Purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the notes being offered, if any are
taken. The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular. After the notes are
released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms. The
offering of the notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the
Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.

The Initial Purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the purchase
agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the notes pursuant to this offering circular.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each Initial
Purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) to persons reasonably believed to be
qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the
United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S
under the Securities Act.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they
will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the
Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will
send to each dealer to whom it sells such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other
notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

113


-----

In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale
of such notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Issuer has agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a period
of 90 days after the date of this offering circular, neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates
over which it exercises management or voting control, nor any person acting on its behalf will, without
the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, offer, sell,
contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes.

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has been
advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the notes but
are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover
positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater
number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of
certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price
of the notes while the offering is in progress.

The Initial Purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Initial
Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates have repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such
Initial Purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for
their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a
result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open
market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any
time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

**_PRIIPs Regulation / Prospectus Directive / Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended,
the “Prospectus Directive”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPS Regulation.

114


-----

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or
cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA))
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Offered Notes in circumstances in
which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers or the Guarantors; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Offered Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

**_Hong Kong_**

The notes may not be offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document other than (i) in
circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies
(Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32 of the Laws of Hong Kong)
(“Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance”) or which do not constitute an
invitation to the public within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571 of the
Laws of Hong Kong) (“Securities and Futures Ordinance”), or (ii) to “professional investors” as defined
in the Securities and Futures Ordinance and any rules made thereunder, or (iii) in other circumstances
which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” as defined in the Companies (Winding Up
and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the
notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case
whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be
accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the securities laws of
Hong Kong) other than with respect to notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to
persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” in Hong Kong as defined in the
Securities and Futures Ordinance and any rules made thereunder.

**_Singapore_**

This offering circular has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of
Singapore. Accordingly, this offering circular and any other document or material in connection with the
offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the notes may not be circulated or distributed,
nor may the notes be offered or sold, or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or
purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other than (i) to an institutional
investor (as defined in Section 4A of the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter 289 of Singapore (the
“SFA”)) under Section 274 of the SFA, (ii) to a relevant person (as defined in Section 275(2) of the
SFA) pursuant to Section 275(1) of the SFA, or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A) of the SFA,
and in accordance with the conditions specified in Section 275 of the SFA or (iii) otherwise pursuant to,
and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provision of the SFA, in each case
subject to conditions set forth in the SFA.

Where the notes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 of the SFA by a relevant person
which is a corporation (which is not an accredited investor (as defined in Section 4A of the SFA)) the
sole business of which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or
more individuals, each of whom is an accredited investor, the securities (as defined in Section 239(1)
of the SFA) of that corporation shall not be transferable for 6 months after that corporation has

in compliance with any relevant laws and regulations of Japan.

**_Canada_**

The notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as
principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus
Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined
in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant

transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with
remedies for rescission or damages if this offering circular (including any amendment thereto) contains
a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the
purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or
territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the
purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the
initial purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding
underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged
in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking,

116


-----

advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market
making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of
these services to the issuer and to persons and entities with relationships with the issuer, for which
they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or
their affiliates also provide funding under the Issuer’s receivables facility. In particular, certain of the
Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under our revolving credit facility and, as
a result of such role, will receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from this offering used to repay
borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their
affiliates have agreed to provide us with interim financing in the amount of $975.0 million in the event
this offering is not consummated. U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., one of the Initial Purchasers, is an
affiliate of the trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers,
and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or
instruments of the issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons
and entities with relationships with the issuer. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may
also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and
may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in
such assets, securities and instruments. If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending
relationship with the Issuer, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and
certain other of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase
of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of the notes offered hereby.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about,
2018, which will be the business day following the date of this offering circular (such
settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who
wish to trade notes prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that
the notes will initially settle T+, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of
any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade notes prior to
their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.
