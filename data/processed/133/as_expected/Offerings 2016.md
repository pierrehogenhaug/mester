**INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Prospectus contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements. The words
“believe”, “anticipate”, “expect”, “intend”, “plan”, “predict”, “continue”, “assume”, “positioned”, “may”,
“will”, “should”, “shall”, “risk” and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future
events and future trends identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include
all matters that are not historical facts. In particular, the statements under the headings “Overview”,
_“Risk Factors” “Information on the Historic Ladbrokes Group”, “Information on the Historic Coral_
_Group”, “Information about the Merger” and “Pro forma numbers for the Group” and regarding the_
Company’s strategy and other future events or prospects are forward-looking statements. You should
not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in many cases beyond the Company’s control. Such
forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the Company’s present
and future business strategies and the environment in which the Group will operate in the future. By
their nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances which may or may not occur
in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. The actual results,
performance or achievements of the Group, or industry results, may be materially different from any
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
In addition, even if actual performance, results of operations, internal rate of return, financial condition,
distributions to shareholders and the development of its financing strategies are consistent with the
forward-looking statements contained in this Prospectus, those results or developments may not be
indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

Key risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected
are set out more fully in the section of this Prospectus headed “Risk Factors”. Investors should
specifically and carefully consider these factors, which could cause actual results to differ, before
making an investment decision.

These forward-looking statements reflect the Company and/or the Issuer’s judgement as at the date of
this Prospectus and are not intended to give any assurances as to future results. To the extent
required by the FCA, the London Stock Exchange or applicable law (including as may be required by
the Prospectus Rules, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules), the
Company and the Issuer will update or revise the information in this Prospectus. Otherwise, the
Company and the Issuer expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any
updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this Prospectus to reflect any
change in expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on
which any such statement is based.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE HISTORIC LADBROKES GROUP**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union (“IFRS”) and,
unless otherwise stated, all financial information relating to the Historic Ladbrokes Group contained or
incorporated by reference in this Prospectus has been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

All financial information relating to the Historic Ladbrokes Group contained in this Prospectus, unless
otherwise stated, has either been extracted from either the audited financial statements of the
Company as of and for the financial years ended 31 December 2013, 31 December 2014 and
31 December 2015, as set out in the Guarantor’s Annual Report and Accounts 2013, the Guarantor’s
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 and the Guarantor’s Annual Report and Accounts 2015,
respectively, which are incorporated by reference into this Prospectus, or from the unaudited interim
financial statements of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2016 contained in the Interim
Results 2016, which are incorporated by reference into this Prospectus. Where information has been
extracted from the Interim Results 2016 (or the comparative information for the six months ended
30 June 2015), the information is described as unaudited unless otherwise stated.

Percentages in tables have been rounded and accordingly may not add up to 100.0 per cent. Certain
financial data have been rounded. As a result of this rounding, the totals of data presented in this
Prospectus may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such data.

**HISTORIC LADBROKES GROUP NON-IFRS MEASURES**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group assesses the performance of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s business
using a variety of key financial measures. Some of these measures are termed “non-IFRS measures”
because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the
most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are
calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. A summary of the
key non-IFRS measures discussed in this Prospectus, and of how such measures are used by the
Historic Ladbrokes Group, is presented below. The Historic Ladbrokes Group does not regard these
non-IFRS measures as a substitute for the equivalent measures calculated and presented in
accordance with IFRS or those calculated financial measures that are calculated in accordance with
IFRS. The non-IFRS measures presented below may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled
measures used by other companies including competitors of the Historic Ladbrokes Group.]

**Gross Win**

Gross win is a non-IFRS revenue measure which is defined as amounts wagered less customer
winnings and before the deduction of free bets, promotion and bonuses. The Historic Ladbrokes Group
uses this measure as one of its assessments of revenue. Certain taxes and duties, including betting
duty and the horserace betting levy, are levied based on gross win. The IFRS financial measure most
directly comparable to gross win is revenue.

**EBITDA**

EBITDA is a non-IFRS profit measure which is defined as earnings before exceptional items, interest
income and expenses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Each of the constituent parts of
EBITDA appears in the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s IFRS income statement.

Since all entities do not calculate EBITDA in the same way, the presentation of EBITDA may not be
consistent with similar measures used in other companies.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to
enable investors to compare the performance of the business from period to period. Measures broadly
similar to EBITDA are used by analysts, ratings agencies and investors in assessing the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s performance. The IFRS financial measure most directly comparable to EBITDA is
operating profit pre-exceptional items.

7


-----

**Net Debt**

Net debt is a non-IFRS financial position measure defined as interest bearing loans and borrowings,
obligations under finance leases and bank overdrafts less cash (excluding customer funds) and short
term deposits. Each of the components of net debt appears in the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s IFRS
balance sheet. The Historic Ladbrokes Group believes that the presentation of net debt provides useful
information to investors as it provides information on liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and
leverage. Furthermore, certain debt rating agencies, creditors and credit analysts monitor the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s net debt as part of their assessments of the Historic Ladbrokes Group.

**Net Revenue**

Net revenue is calculated by deducting vending income (the sale of food and beverages and recorded
net of VAT) from revenue.

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE HISTORIC CORAL GROUP**

The Historic Coral Group prepares its combined financial statements in accordance with IFRS and,
unless otherwise stated, all financial information relating to the Historic Coral Group contained or
incorporated by reference in this Prospectus has been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

All financial information relating to the Historic Coral Group contained in this Prospectus, unless
otherwise stated, has been extracted from the combined financial information relating to the Historic
Coral Group set out in Part IX of the prospectus of the Company published in connection with the
Merger and dated 27 October 2016 (the “Merger Prospectus”). Where information has been extracted
from the unaudited comparative information for the 40 weeks ended 4 July 2015, the information is
described as unaudited unless otherwise stated.

Percentages in tables have been rounded and accordingly may not add up to 100.0 per cent. Certain
financial data have been rounded. As a result of this rounding, the totals of data presented in this
Prospectus may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such data.

**HISTORIC CORAL GROUP NON-IFRS MEASURES**

The Historic Coral Group assesses the performance of the Historic Coral Group’s business using a
variety of key financial measures. Some of these measures are termed “non-IFRS measures” because
they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using
financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. A summary of the key non-IFRS
measures discussed in this Prospectus, and of how such measures are used by the Historic Coral
Group, is presented below. The Historic Coral Group does not regard these non-IFRS measures as a
substitute for the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those
calculated financial measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS measures
presented below may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies
including competitors of the Historic Coral Group.

winnings and before the deduction of free bets, promotion and bonuses. The Historic Coral Group uses
this measure as one of its assessments of revenue. Certain taxes and duties, including betting duty
and the horserace betting levy, are levied based on gross win. The IFRS financial measure most
directly comparable to gross win is revenue.

**Gross Win Margin**

Gross win margin is a non-IFRS measure defined as gross win divided by amounts wagered and
represents the percentage of amounts wagered that is retained by the Historic Coral Group. The

Historic Coral Group believes that gross win margin is useful in assessing the Historic Coral Group’s
ability to generate revenues from the amounts wagered by customers and that it provides a basis for
assessing the profitability of certain activities of the Historic Coral Group. Gross win margin is used to
evaluate the Historic Coral Group’s performance of our product base particularly the sportsbook.

**EBITDA**

EBITDA is a non-IFRS profit measure which is defined as earnings before exceptional items, interest
income and expenses, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Each of the constituent parts of
EBITDA appears in the Historic Coral Group’s IFRS income statement.

Since all entities do not calculate EBITDA in the same way, the presentation of EBITDA may not be
consistent with similar measures used in other companies.

The Historic Coral Group believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to
enable investors to compare the performance of the business from period to period. Measures broadly
similar to EBITDA are used by analysts, ratings agencies and investors in assessing the Historic Coral
Group’s performance. The IFRS financial measure most directly comparable to EBITDA is operating
profit pre-exceptional items.

**Net Debt**

Net debt is a non-IFRS measure that has been derived from the line items “Cash and cash
equivalents” and “Interest bearing loans and other borrowings” in the combined financial statements of
the Historic Coral Group. It is calculated by deducting the financial statements’ line item “Cash and
cash equivalents” from the financial statements’ line item “Interest bearing loans and other borrowings”.

**Net Revenue**

Net revenue is calculated by deducting vending income (the sale of food and beverages and recorded
net of VAT) from revenue.

**THE HISTORIC LADBROKES GROUP AND THE HISTORIC CORAL GROUP LBO FIGURES**

Except where expressly stated otherwise, all references in this Prospectus to the number of LBOs and/
or other property interests that are held by the Historic Ladbrokes Group and/or the Historic Coral
Group include the 185 the Historic Ladbrokes Group LBOs and the 174 the Historic Coral Group LBOs
that are to be transferred to the Purchasers under the terms of the Business Transfer Agreements.

**OVERVIEW**

_The following overview highlights significant aspects of the Merger, the Historic Ladbrokes Group, the_
_Historic Coral Group and the Group’s business and regarding the issue of the Notes, but you should_
_read the entire Prospectus, including the information incorporated by reference herein, before making_
_an investment decision. You should also carefully consider the information set out under “Risk_
_Factors”._

**The Merger**

The Merger completed on [1 November] 2016. The Group (which is now made up of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group) will be one of the leading European betting and
gaming groups providing its customers with a wide choice of products and flexibility across channels.

The combination of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group is compelling
strategically and is attractive as a platform for long-term growth. There are five opportunities that have
been identified and will be central to the overall strategy of the Group, which are: (i) the creation of a
group with the potential to deliver faster online growth; (ii) the creation of a group with the UK’s largest
LBO estate; (iii) the creation of a group with an extensive international portfolio of regulated
businesses; (iv) the delivery of significant synergies underpinning Shareholder returns; and (v) the
creation of a group with an enhanced and integrated technology platform.

_The potential to deliver faster online growth_

On a combined basis, the online business of the Group will generate approximately 25 per cent. of
revenues and would be a substantially increased player in the UK online market as a result of the
Merger.

Digital sports betting and gaming remain the key growth opportunities in the market and the Merger
enables the Group to drive further online growth. This will be delivered through enhanced multi-channel
and marketing capabilities, and the ability to deploy shared innovation across multiple brands.

An effective multi-channel offering delivers higher value to customers at lower cost and enhances
customer experience, driving loyalty. The Historic Coral Group has already deployed market leading
multi-channel technology across its estate. The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s multi-channel programme
launched in July 2015 has now delivered over 130,000 signups. Metrics such as player value and
retention associated with these players continue to look strong compared to core digital players. The
Group intends to take the best from both the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s and the Historic Coral Group’s
multi-channel technology to enhance its overall omni-channel offer.

The Group intends to operate a dual-brand strategy in the UK across both its retail and its digital
businesses. The Board believes that this is the optimal route to maximise the value of the Group’s
customer bases. The intention is to continue to offer customers distinctive products and promotions.
Where appropriate, the Group will leverage product innovation and technology across both brands, in
particular through multi-channel which will be central to generating digital growth. In digital, where
customers typically have multiple betting applications on their smartphone, the Group will aim to be two
of these applications rather than one. The Group also is expected to be able to use its sophisticated
customer analytical tools to anticipate the actions of players, thereby allowing it to present attractive
personalised offers from the second brand to online customers who are expected to be about to churn.

The use of dual brands does not limit the delivery of synergies – the Group expects to combine its core
trading platforms, IT systems and retail governance teams, and through dual-brand sourcing deliver
procurement synergies in certain key categories of marketing spend. IT integration planning is well
advanced and a plan has been put in place for the integration of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s and
the Historic Coral Group’s IT systems.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group also intend to pool their digital innovation
teams in order to strengthen the product pipelines of the Group. The Group will continue to focus on
delivering innovation across its multiple brands, with a view to enhancing returns.


11


-----

The Group will have market leading technology supporting its online operations. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group currently use similar technology platforms, including
partnerships with suppliers such as Playtech, OpenBet and Scientific Games. This commonality is
expected to accelerate integration without causing any material disruption to the customers of the
Group.

_The UK’s largest LBO estate – strongly cash generative, more efficient and sustainable in the long_
_term_

The Group’s dual-brand strategy will ensure that its customers can retain their brand preference. The
combined retail estate of the Group will continue to build on its track record of product innovation.

The Merger also represents an opportunity to improve further shop efficiency through the reduction of
central overheads and through joint procurement. This will make the Group’s UK retail estate more
resilient in the face of recent taxation increases.

_Disposals_

On 26 July 2016, the CMA published its final conclusions in relation to the Merger in which it stated
that the Merger could proceed subject to the divestment of 350 to 400 LBOs, and that Completion of
the Merger could occur when the LBO divestment process was substantially complete.

On 15 October 2016:

(a) Ladbrokes Betting & Gaming Limited entered into: (i) a business transfer agreement to sell 168
LBOs to Done Brothers (Cash Betting) Limited (trading as Betfred) (“Betfred”); and (ii) a business
transfer agreement to sell 17 LBOs to StanJames (Abingdon) Limited (trading as Stan James) (“Stan
**James” and together with Betfred, the “Purchasers”) (together the “Ladbrokes Business Transfer**
**Agreements”); and**

(b) Coral Racing Limited entered into: (i) a business transfer agreement to sell 154 LBOs to Betfred;
and (ii) a business transfer agreement to sell 20 LBOs to Stan James (together the “Coral Business
**Transfer Agreements”),**

(the Ladbrokes Business Transfer Agreements and the Coral Business Transfer Agreements, together
being, the “Business Transfer Agreements”).

On 21 October 2016, Ladbrokes Betting & Gaming Limited entered into a further business transfer
agreement, on substantially the same terms as the Business Transfer Agreements, with Bet 21 Limited
in respect of the sale of 1 LBO to Bet 21 Limited (the “Additional Transfer Agreement”).

The aggregate number of LBOs being sold to Betfred is 322 for a cash consideration of £55.0
million. The aggregate number of LBOs being sold to Stan James is 37 for a cash consideration of £0.5
million. The Business Transfer Agreements were entered into on substantially similar terms. The
Business Transfer Agreements contain certain customary warranties and indemnities in relation to the
business and assets transferring to the Purchasers, including an indemnity in respect of all matters
arising in connection with the operation of the relevant business prior to completion of the relevant
Business Transfer Agreement.

On 26 October 2016 the CMA approved the purchasers, the LBO disposal packages and the terms of
the Business Transfer Agreements and the Additional Transfer Agreement. Descriptions of the
Business Transfer Agreements have been included in sections 6 and 7 of Part XIII (Additional
Information) of this Prospectus.

_An extensive international portfolio of regulated businesses_

The international operations will represent approximately 13 per cent. of the Group’s revenue.

The Group will have strong retail and online operations in Italy (number two online), Belgium (number
one in retail) and Spain (number one in retail) and an attractive and rapidly growing online operation in
Australia (number three corporate bookmaker).


12


-----

Combining the substantial experience gained from these operations with the enhanced financial
resources of the Group provides a foundation for future international growth.

_Significant synergies underpinning Shareholder returns_

The Group will be able to achieve recurring annual pre-tax cost synergies of at least £65 million as a
result of the Merger. The Company expects these synergies to be phased in over the three years after
completion of the Merger on [1 November] 2016 (“Completion”).

_An enhanced and integrated technology platform_

To assist in providing the flexibility for the Group to achieve integration and realise synergies from the
combination of the Historic Coral Group’s and the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s digital businesses,
Playtech has agreed with the Company to amend the existing Marketing Services Agreement with the
Company.

As part of this arrangement, Playtech and the Company have agreed to accelerate the determination of
amounts due to Playtech under the Marketing Services Agreement. The sum agreed is £75 million, of
which £40 million was satisfied by way of the issue of shares in the Group on Completion (the
“Playtech Issue”) and with a further guaranteed £35 million in cash paid upon delivery by Playtech of
key operational milestones but, in any event, within 42 months following Completion.

This will accelerate the integration of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s and Historic Coral Group’s digital
platforms and therefore the delivery of cost synergies. The additional benefits of this agreement are not
reflected in the synergy estimate and would reflect incremental value generation for the Group.

**Integration Review**

At the time of the Circular, the directors of the Company and the directors of Gala Coral recognised
that, to achieve some of the expected benefits of the Merger, it would be necessary to undertake a
review of how best to integrate the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group (the
“Integration Review”). The Integration Review has now commenced and a steering committee has
been established to coordinate integration planning. However, prior to the completion of the Merger,
the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group were separate groups of companies and
data sharing was subject to certain restrictions for commercial and competition law reasons.

The Integration Review has started to put together plans to integrate the Group’s operations and
resources to ensure that the optimal combination is achieved post-Completion. In addition, the
Integration Review has resulted in some proposed changes to the locations of the Group’s places of
business and work is currently being done to determine whether any fixed assets of the Group will be
required to be redeployed. The analysis carried out to date has indicated the potential to generate cost
synergies for the Group in areas where there is an overlap of functions. Although the number of
employees actually affected by the Merger will depend on the outcome of the Integration Review, it is
estimated that there will be a decrease of approximately 3 per cent. of the Group’s full-time equivalent
employees.

The existing contractual and statutory employment rights of all employees of the Historic Coral Group
and the Historic Ladbrokes Group will be fully respected following Completion save to the extent that
the location of the places of business of the Group are impacted by the Integration Review.

It is not envisaged that contributions into the Company pension schemes, the accrual of benefits for
existing members or the admission of new members will be impacted by the Merger.

**Financial effects of the Merger**

Having reviewed and analysed the potential benefits of the Merger and taking into account the factors
that the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group can influence, it is expected that the
Group, comprising both the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group in their entirety, will


13


-----

be able to achieve recurring annual pre-tax cost synergies of at least £65 million as a result of the
Merger. The Group expects these synergies to be phased in over the three years after Completion with
approximately 35 per cent. delivered in year one, 85 per cent. in year two and 100 per cent. by the end
of year three, post-Completion.

The principal sources of quantified cost synergies are as follows:

(i) approximately £7 million from reduced corporate costs; and

(ii) approximately £58 million through combining the retail and digital operations, by eliminating
duplicated activities where appropriate and by streamlining general and administration costs
across the two operations. It is expected that these savings will be realised approximately 60 per
cent. in retail and approximately 40 per cent. in digital operations, respectively.

It is expected that the realisation of the quantified cost synergies will result in non-recurring costs of
approximately 1.25 times annual quantified synergies, predominantly in the first year after Completion.
Aside from these costs, no material cost dis-synergies are expected in connection with the Merger.

In addition to the quantified cost synergies outlined above, the Group expects further upside from
cross-brand marketing, exchange of expertise relating to product innovation and the transfer of
operational best practices (the “Incremental Synergies”).

The Retail Disposals are not expected to impact the quantified cost synergies or non-recurring costs of
implementation. The associated revenue and EBITDA for the LBOs that are being transferred for the
most recent full financial year for both the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group is
£12.8 million and £13 million, respectively.

The Board believes the financial benefits will accrue as a direct result of the Merger and could not be
achieved independently. The estimated synergies reflect both the beneficial elements and the relevant
costs.

**Historic Ladbrokes Group**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group is a bookmaker that primarily operates in the UK, Australia, Belgium,
Ireland and Spain and which enjoys strong brand recognition in its key markets. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group provides betting and gaming services across multiple channels and markets with
£1.2 billion of net revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s business consists of offering a variety of betting and gaming products.
The Historic Ladbrokes Group offers sports betting on a number of sports, with horseracing being the
most popular sport it offers odds on. The Historic Ladbrokes Group also accepts bets on non-sporting
events, such as political elections and popular music chart results. The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s
gaming products include slots, casino games, bingo, poker and other skill games.

_Principal channels of product delivery_

The Historic Ladbrokes Group delivers its betting and gaming products through its retail outlets and
online channels. The Historic Ladbrokes Group also offers betting via telephone, including offering a
personalised service for certain high net worth individuals, and has a central support division.

In the UK, the Historic Ladbrokes Group is the second largest retail operator in the UK retail betting
and gaming market, based on number of LBOs with a market share of approximately 24.4 per cent as
at 31 March 2016. At 25 October 2016, the Historic Ladbrokes Group had 2,140 LBOs in Great Britain
and 8,507 gaming machines at the LBOs. The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s UK retail business
accounted for 69.2 per cent. of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s net revenue (excluding high rollers) for
the year ended 31 December 2015.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s European retail business (including Northern Ireland) accounted for
10.0 per cent. of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s net revenue (excluding high rollers) for the year ended


14


-----

31 December 2015. As at 25 October 2016, the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s services were available in
a total of 141 outlets in Ireland, 77 in Northern Ireland, 453 in Belgium (a majority of which are
franchisee and newspaper outlets), and 1,721 in Spain. The Historic Ladbrokes Group operates in
Spain through its joint venture with Cirsa Gaming Corporation, Sportium Apuestas Deportivas S.A.
(“Sportium”), which is Spain’s largest bookmaker on the basis of gross win. A majority of the outlets in
Spain are locations where Sportium has acquired the right to provide its betting and gaming services
(for example in bars through SSBTs or corners, which are areas within arcades or other outlets where
Sportium has SSBTs and there is a manned counter), rather than being locations operated directly by
Sportium or a Sportium franchisee.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group also operates an online betting and gaming business, offering
innovative products through Ladbrokes.com, the seventh largest operator in the UK online market as at
31 December 2015, and Ladbrokes Australia, the third largest corporate bookmaker in Australia on the
basis of revenue, and other branded websites within the Historic Ladbrokes Group. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s digital business accounted for 20.3 per cent. of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s net
revenue (excluding high rollers) for the year ended 31 December 2015.

**Historic Coral Group**

The Historic Coral Group is one of Europe’s largest betting and gaming groups based on annual gross
win, with an established presence in the UK and Italy, the two largest regulated betting and gaming
markets in Europe. The Historic Coral Group comprises three main trading divisions: Coral Retail,
Eurobet Retail and Online. The Historic Coral Group operates Telebet, a telephone-based betting
operation and a central support division.

_Coral Retail_

Coral Retail is the third largest operator in the retail market in the UK where it directly owns and
operates 1,806 LBOs under the ‘Coral’ brand with an estimated market share of approximately 20.8
per cent. as at 31 March 2016 based on number of LBOs. LBOs operated by Coral Retail offer both
OTC betting and FOBTs.

_Eurobet Retail_

Eurobet Retail is now number three in the market for OTC betting in Italy based on annual gross win,
which is primarily generated from football betting operations, with a smaller share in the horse race
betting market. Eurobet Retail operates in the Italian retail market under the ‘Eurobet’ brand through
LBOs run on a franchise model.

_Online_

The Historic Coral Group operates the Coral UK Online business and the Eurobet Online business.

The Coral UK Online business operates in the UK through three key brands: ‘Coral’, ‘Gala Bingo’ and
‘Gala Casino’. It is the sixth largest operator in the UK market with a 8.1 per cent. market share as at
31 December 2015.

Eurobet Online operates through the website www.eurobet.it and is available to Italian residents. It
delivers a full range of sports betting, casino and games products, including virtual racing and bet-inplay products.

**Industry**

The Group will continue to operate in the betting and gaming industry. Demand for the Group’s
products and services, will be influenced by general economic conditions and consumer trends which
is difficult to predict, particularly in the online gaming market (which is relatively new and subject to


15


-----

ever increasing competition from other industry participants). The betting and gaming industry is
subject to extensive and increasing regulatory and licensing requirements, taxation and levies both
inside and outside the UK, which may change over time for a variety of reasons, including as a result of
political pressure, public opinion and media coverage.

There have recently been a number of significant mergers in the betting and gaming industry as
industry participants look to increase the scale of their operations. Such increases in scale make
investments in technology and marketing more affordable. In addition, larger betting and gaming
operators are better equipped to understand the increasingly extensive and complex regulatory and
licensing requirements that they face and to absorb the impact of any adverse changes in regulation,
taxation and/or levies.

**Strategy**

The Group’s strategy will seek to exploit the combined strengths of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and
the Historic Coral Group, and will initially focus on the following strategic opportunities.

_Developing multi-channel_

Digital sports betting and gaming remain the key growth opportunities in the market. The Group will
seek to leverage its strong positions in the OTC sports betting markets of the UK, Belgium, Ireland,
Italy and Spain to drive further online growth.

The Group’s combined multi-channel experience of the “Grid” and “Coral Connect” will allow it to
provide the market leading omni-channel offering in the sector. The Group intends to take the best
from both of these products to enhance its overall omni-channel offering.

_Maintaining dual brands in the UK_

The Group intends to operate a dual-brand strategy in the UK across both its retail and its digital
businesses. This is expected to be the optimal route to maximise the value of the Group’s customer
bases. The intention is to continue to offer customers distinctive products and promotions. Where
appropriate, the Group will leverage product innovation and technology across both brands in particular
in multi-channel which will be central to generating digital growth. In digital, where customers typically
have multiple betting applications on their smartphone, the Group will aim to be two of these
applications rather than one. The Group is also expected to be able to use its sophisticated customer
analytical tools to anticipate the actions of players, thereby allowing it to present attractive and
personalised offers from the second brand to online customers who are expected to be about to churn.

_Pursuing international opportunities_

The Group will review and seek opportunities in international markets both to enhance its existing
international portfolio, but also to manage the risk of an over reliance on its core UK market.
Opportunities that allow the Group to leverage its sports betting expertise and cross sell into its gaming
knowledge will be the basis for its review of international opportunities. However, international markets
with a strong gaming customer base in which the Board believes the Group can grow market share
shall continue to be front of mind.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group’s combined expertise in working with
regulators and the development of the Group’s regulatory and compliance experience will prepare the
Group for working with international partners if the opportunity appears and with the Group’s scales,
brands and product innovation the Group will have much to offer international partners if such a
partnership is of benefit to the Group.

**Notes:**

(1) The financial information of the Historic Ladbrokes Group for the year ended 31 December 2015
and the financial information of the Historic Ladbrokes Group as at 30 June 2016 have been


28


-----

extracted, without material adjustment, from the published financial statements of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the published unaudited interim
financial statements of the Historic Ladbrokes Group for the six months ended 30 June 2016
respectively, which are both incorporated by reference in this Prospectus.

(2) The financial information of the Historic Coral Group for the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2015
and the financial information of the Historic Coral Group as at 2 July 2016 has been extracted,
without material adjustment, from the historical financial information of the Historic Coral Group
set out in Part IX of the Merger Prospectus.

(3) The adjustments arising as a result of the Merger are set out below:

(i) The consideration will be the issuance of the Consideration Shares to Gala Group Finance
Limited. The total consideration payable is £1,167.2 million.

The consideration has been calculated on the basis that the Company issues 866,518,803
Consideration Shares with a nominal value of 28 **[1]⁄3 pence each at a price of 134.7 pence**
per share, being the price of an Ordinary Share at 25 October 2016. An adjustment has
been made to goodwill (which has been calculated based on the balance sheet of the
Historic Coral Group as at 2 July 2016), as follows

Total consideration £1,167.2 million
Less: Historic Coral Group net assets acquired £(414.7) million

Pro forma goodwill adjustment £752.5 million

No purchase price allocation assumptions in relation to the value of any acquired Historic
Coral Group intangible assets have been included in the pro forma statement of net assets.
All purchase consideration in excess of the Historic Coral Group net asset value has
therefore been treated as goodwill. After Completion, ahead of 31 December 2016, the
Directors will be required to undertake a fair value exercise of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of the acquired business to assess the purchase price for accounting purposes.
This fair value exercise may result in fluctuations in the value of the Group’s balance sheet
line items.

(ii) Estimated transaction costs of £76.1 million are expected to be incurred in connection with
the Merger of which £20.3 million had been incurred by 31 December 2015 resulting in a
pro forma income statement adjustment of £55.8 million. A further £22.3 million had been
incurred in the period to 30 June 2016, resulting in a pro forma cash adjustment in the
balance sheet of £33.5 million. No tax impact has been assumed.

(4) This adjustment includes:

(i) Of the £850.5 million net debt net indebtedness of Coral at 2 July 2016 (which includes
£20.4m of cash held on behalf of customers), an adjustment of £985.0 million has been
made to reflect the repayment of the amounts owed to the Gala Coral Group undertakings,
offset by the draw down against the New Facilities Agreement of up to £985.0 million. This
drawdown is stated net of £3.3 million in estimated debt issue costs associated with the
facilities which will be paid in cash and deducted from the carrying value of the new
facilities. These issue costs will be amortised over a 4 year term, and are presented, along
with the new facilities, as non-current liabilities.

(ii) A reduction in the finance costs of £52.9 million which reflects the interest incurred by Gala
Group Finance Limited on its loans and borrowings with GC Group (Jersey) Limited
undertakings, which would not have been incurred by the Group had the transaction
completed on 1 January 2015, offset by the interest charge on the additional drawdown
against the New Facilities Agreement, not against the interest charge on the Notes. The
reduction in finance costs is offset by a related reduction in the income tax credit of £10.7
million.

(iii) The tax impact of the above adjustments.

(5) In connection with the Merger, Ladbrokes Betting & Gaming Limited and Coral Racing Limited
entered into the Business Transfer Agreements and the Additional Business Transfer


29


-----

Agreement, pursuant to which the Group will transfer 360 LBOs to the Purchasers and Bet 21
Limited for an agreed value of £55.5 million. The pro forma financial information table does not
include the effects of the Retail Disposals, however the associated EBITDA of the LBOs that are
to be transferred for the most recent full financial year for both the Historic Ladbrokes Group and
the Historic Coral Group was £12.8 million and £13.0 million, respectively.

Pursuant to the terms of the New Facilities Agreement, an amount at least equal to 50 per cent.
of the net proceeds from the Retail Disposals shall be applied in prepayment and/or cancellation
of Facility A under the New Facilities Agreement (in accordance with clause 10.7 of that
agreement).

(6) No adjustment has been made to reflect the financial performance of the Historic Ladbrokes
Group since 30 June 2016 or of the Historic Coral Group since 2 July 2016.

(7) The nature of the adjustments described in note 4 and note 5 of the unaudited pro forma income
statement means that adjustments of a similar nature will have a continuing impact on the Group.

**RISK FACTORS**

_The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the_
_Notes and the Guarantor believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations_
_under the Notes Guarantee. Most of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and_
_neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor is in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such_
_contingency occurring. In addition, risk factors which are specific to the Notes are also described_
_below._

_Factors which the Issuer and the Guarantor believe may be material for the purpose of assessing the_
_market risks associated with the Notes are also described below._

_The Issuer and the Guarantor believe that the factors described below represent the principal risks_
_inherent in investing in the Notes, but the inability of the Issuer to pay interest, principal or other_
_amounts on or in connection with any Notes or of the Guarantor to make payments due under the_
_Notes Guarantee may occur for other reasons and neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor makes any_
_representation that the statements below regarding the risks of holding any Notes are exhaustive._
_Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus_
_and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision._

**RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER AND DIVESTMENT PROCESS**

**Risks relating to the Merger**

**_Synergy benefits resulting from the Merger may fail to materialise, may take longer to realise or_**
**_may be materially lower than has been estimated_**

It is expected that the combination of the businesses of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic
Coral Group will achieve significant cost savings for the Group. However, there is a risk that the
estimated synergy benefits may fail to materialise or that such synergy benefits may be materially
lower than has been estimated or cost more than expected or take longer than expected to achieve.
This risk is heightened because the Group’s ability to achieve the estimated synergies will be
dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond the control of the
Group.

In addition, the expected synergy benefits resulting from the Merger may be materially lower than
expected if, after Completion, the Group’s relationships with suppliers and other partners of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group are adversely affected as a result of the Merger
(including if suppliers and other partners terminate or wish to renegotiate any arrangements with the
Group as a result of the Merger).

Failure to achieve the estimated synergy benefits either at all or within the expected timeframe could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Integration of the Historic Coral Group and the Historic Ladbrokes Group may be more time_**
**_consuming and costly than expected and unforeseen difficulties may arise_**

The integration process of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group following
Completion may be complex. Successful integration will require a significant amount of management
time and may affect or impair the ability of the management team of the Group to run the business
effectively during the period of integration. The integration process may also place a significant
additional burden on the Group’s employees and could lead to employee disengagement and
underperformance. If the integration process proves more difficult than is anticipated, there is a risk to
the operations of the Group.

In addition, the integration may take longer or cost more than is expected, or difficulties relating to the
integration, including those of which the Group is not yet aware, may arise. In such circumstances, the
profitability of the Group could be detrimentally affected, which could have a material adverse effect on
the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Group.

31


-----

**Risks relating to the divestment process**

**_Obligations under the Business Transfer Agreements_**

The Business Transfer Agreements contain certain customary warranties and indemnities given in
favour of each Purchaser, including an indemnity in respect of all matters arising in connection with the
operation of the relevant business prior to completion of the relevant Business Transfer Agreement,
which could cause the Group to incur liabilities and obligations to make payments that may not have
arisen had the Retail Disposals not taken place. Further details of the warranties and indemnities given
to the Purchasers are set out in the “Material Contracts” section of this Prospectus.

**_The Retail Disposals may consume the Enlarged Group’s resources and management time_**

The Retail Disposals are conditional upon Completion of the Merger. Following Completion of the
Merger, the relevant LBOs will be transferred to the relevant purchasers on a phased basis determined
by the purchasers, subject to all such LBOs being required to have transferred by 31 January 2017 in
the case of Stan James and 31 March 2017 in the case of Betfred. The Group will not be able to
determine the timing of the transfer of the LBOs, which may result in transfers of LBOs taking place in
a way which is not optimal for the Group. In addition, the process of transferring the disposed LBOs to
the purchasers may be more complex than expected. The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic
Coral Group have made plans and plan to put in place resources to manage the phased transfer of the
LBOs. However, the Retail Disposals could involve additional costs and may consume more resources
and management time of the Group than is currently expected. Any or a combination of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE BETTING AND GAMING INDUSTRY AND MARKETPLACE**

**Risks relating to the betting and gaming industry**

**_There can be no assurance that the existence and/or the enforcement of laws and regulations in_**
**_jurisdictions from which the Group accepts bets or wagers will not have a material adverse_**
**_effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Group_**

Most countries regulate or, in some cases, prohibit gambling activities. Each of the Historic Ladbrokes
Group and the Historic Coral Group monitored and sought to comply with, and the Group will monitor
and seek to comply with, the relevant laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it has regulated
operations. However, there can be no assurance that the Group and the Directors will not face criminal
or civil claims in jurisdictions from which it accepts, or has accepted, bets and wagers or from which
the Group’s advertisements can, or could be, accessed via the internet for breach of law or regulation
in relation to the Group’s operations. In particular:

_EU_

    - The Group is exposed to the risk of conflicting laws and regulations (or conflicting
interpretations of such laws and regulations) with regard to the legality or appropriate
regulatory compliance of its activities within the EU. The domestic laws and regulations of
certain member states of the EU prohibit, or impose restrictions on, certain betting and
gaming transactions. Any such laws or regulations should, in theory, be consistent with the
principles of freedom of establishment and free movement of services under EU law.
However, the case law in this area suggests that it may be difficult to prove that the
restrictions imposed on betting and gaming transactions by an EU member state are
inconsistent with EU law. Accordingly:

(i) there is a risk that member states will introduce or maintain restrictions or punitive tax
regimes that may be contrary to EU law; and

(ii) the Group and/or the Directors, as applicable, may face criminal or civil claims in such
member states in connection with the actions of the Group, notwithstanding that such
actions may be consistent with EU law.

_Australia_

    - In Australia, interactive and internet gambling is regulated by each individual state, in each
case as applicable to gaming and sports betting activities conducted within such state, and

32


-----

the Interactive Gambling Act 2001, which purports to regulate certain types of interactive and
internet gambling offered to individuals located in Australia. The Interactive Gambling Act
2001 prohibits certain interactive gambling services on racing and sporting events and online
gaming type services, providing that a person is guilty of an offence if that person intentionally
provides such services to people located within Australia. The Group believes that it will have
put in place systems and controls which are intended to ensure that no interactive gambling
service which is prohibited under the Australian legislation is offered to Australian customers.
If these systems and controls were to fail and the Group were to be in breach of any relevant
legislation, the Group and/or the Directors, as applicable, may face criminal or civil claims.

The Commonwealth Government has announced an intention to amend the Interactive
Gambling Act 2001, which may result in further restrictions to the products that can be lawfully
offered to individuals in Australia.

_General_

    - The Group’s systems and controls to ensure regulatory compliance may fail or be found to be
inadequate. The Group has sought to put in place systems and controls in place, which are
intended to ensure that it does not offer products to or accept bets or wagers on either its
betting or its gaming products via the internet from any jurisdiction in which it has determined
that it does not wish to accept bets or wagers (whether because of legal concerns or
otherwise). These systems and controls include monitoring and analysing information
provided by potential customers’ registered addresses and existing customers’ location
through IP address blocking. In the event that the Group’s current or the Historic Ladbrokes
Group’s and/or the Historic Coral Group’s historical systems and controls are found to be
inadequate (as a result of a failure of the IT systems used to prevent bets or wagers being
accepted from any jurisdiction in which it has been determined not to accept bets or wagers or
otherwise) or that a customer manages to place a bet or wager from a jurisdiction where the
relevant group is, or was, not licensed to conduct business or where betting or gaming is, or
was, otherwise restricted or illegal, the Group and/or the Directors, as applicable, may face
criminal or civil claims.

    - The Group may not consider the gambling laws and regulations in every jurisdiction from
which they accept bets or wagers or from which their advertisements can be accessed via the
internet and may be subject to the application of existing laws and regulations of which they
are not aware, under which the Group and/or the Directors, as applicable, may face criminal
or civil claims.

Even if such claims are successfully resisted they may result in considerable legal and other costs
being incurred, management time and resources being diverted and damage to the Group’s reputation
and brand image. If such claims are successful they may result in civil or criminal sanctions against the
Group and/or the Directors, as applicable. Any or a combination of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_There can be no assurance that licensing requirements in jurisdictions in which the Group has_**
**_established operations will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations of the Group_**

Gambling licences and approvals were held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group in the jurisdictions in which they had established
operations and such licences and approvals are now held by or on behalf of the relevant members of
the Group. In addition, certain of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s and the Historic Coral Group’s
employees and senior executives, including its Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, were
required to hold personal management licences and the same requirements apply to the Group. These
licences and approvals include the following:

_UK retail_

UK gambling licences are held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group. The Group’s UK
retail operations are regulated by the Gambling Commission.

33


-----

_Online_

Gibraltarian remote gambling licences are held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group.
The Group’s online betting and gaming operations are regulated by the Gibraltar Gambling
Commissioner in respect of regulated territories where licences are not already held and it is legally
permitted to provide remote gambling facilities into that territory under their Gibraltarian remote
gambling licence. UK remote gambling licences are also held by or on behalf of the relevant members
of the Group.

_Australia_

A Northern Territory gambling licence is held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group.
This licence allows the Group’s Australian business to accept bets and wagers from all states across
Australia, provided that all such bets and wagers are processed through servers located in Australia.
The Group’s Australian operations are regulated by the Northern Territory Racing Commission.
Ladbrokes Digital Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian Financial Services Licence, which authorises it
to provide non-cash payment products (the relevant products being the Ladbrokes Visa Debit Card and
the Ladbrokes EFTPOS Card). For these purposes Ladbrokes Digital Australia Pty Ltd is regulated by
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

_Ireland_

Irish bookmakers’ licences are held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group. The Group’s
Irish retail operations are licensed by the Irish Revenue Commissioners.

_Belgium_

Belgian gambling licences are held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group. The Group’s
Belgian retail and online operations are regulated by the Belgian Gaming Commission.

_Spain_

Spanish gambling licences are held by or on behalf of the Group’s joint venture with Cirsa Gaming
Corporation, Sportium. Sportium is regulated by the applicable regional regulatory authorities and the
Dirección General de Ordenación del Juego (“DGOJ”).

_Italy_

The renewal process for Italian sports and horserace betting licences is currently unclear. However,
such licences are held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group (for more detail, see
“There is currently little clarity in relation to the renewal processes for the Italian sports and horserace
_betting licences held by Eurobet Retail”, below). The Group’s Italian retail operations are regulated by_
L’Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (“ADM”).

The licences that are held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group, are subject to a
number of terms and conditions and breach of such terms and conditions, including, in some
instances, breaches committed by members of the corporate group other than the relevant licence
holder, could result in fines, termination or non-renewal of the licence or approval in question or other
regulatory sanctions. The termination or non-renewal of all or any such licences or approvals, whether
for breach of their terms and conditions or otherwise, or the imposition of any regulatory sanctions,
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_There can be no assurance that laws, regulations or licensing requirements applicable to the_**
**_Group will not change_**

There can be no assurance that any jurisdiction from which the Group accepts bets and wagers or
from which its advertisements can be accessed via the internet will not introduce laws or regulations
seeking to prohibit or regulate betting and gaming activities or the advertisement of such activities or
amend existing laws or regulations, which could impair the Group’s ability to undertake betting and
gaming operations in that jurisdiction and have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

34


-----

The UK’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced a review of gaming machines and
social responsibility measures on 24 October 2016 (the “Triennial Review”). The UK Government’s
stated objective of the Triennial Review is to look across the industry to determine what, if any,
changes are needed to strike the right balance between socially responsible growth and the protection
of consumers and wider communities. The UK Government has asked parties with an interest in the
way in which gambling is regulated in Great Britain to provide their views on: (i) maximum stakes and
prizes for all categories of gaming machines permitted under the Gambling Act 2005; (ii) the
appropriate allocations of gaming machines permitted in licensed premises under the Gambling Act
2005; and (iii) social responsibility measures to minimise the risk of gambling related harm across the
industry as a whole, including gaming machines. The UK Government has indicated it will also
specifically review, and consider views on, gambling advertising to understand whether the existing
measures ensure that the young and vulnerable are protected.

Depending on the findings of the Triennial Review, the UK Government may decide to make changes
to the laws or regulations applicable to the business of the Group, including the laws and regulations
applicable to FOBTs or the advertisement of betting and gaming activities and any such changes could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, there have been some recent signs that the Australian betting and gaming regulatory
environment may be becoming more difficult. For example, the Northern Territory Racing Commission
recently banned “click-to-call” functionality, which Australian betting and gaming operators had used to
allow customers to place in-play bets on sport using synthesised voice calls. Ladbrokes Digital
Australia Pty Ltd withdrew its “click-to-call” product as a result of this ban. The Commonwealth
Government is proposing to introduce a similar ban under possible reforms to the Interactive Gambling
Act 2001 (Cth), such a ban is likely to have minimal impact on Ladbrokes Digital Australia Pty Ltd
because it will duplicate the existing Northern Territory ban. This change, or any further tightening of
laws and regulations relating to gambling activities in Australia, could restrict the Group’s growth
opportunities in Australia and have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any jurisdiction in which licences are held by the Group
will not change its licensing requirements, including the terms and conditions to which such licences
and approvals are subject. If the regulatory scheme of any jurisdiction in which the Group operates
were to change its licensing requirements, the Group may be required to expend significant capital or
other resources in order to comply with the new requirements and/or may be required to modify its
product offering or its operations in order to comply with the new requirements and/or may not be able
to meet the new requirements, any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In particular, the Scotland Act 2016 has given the Scottish Parliament the power to regulate the
number of gaming machines that a betting premise licence authorises the licence holder to make
available on the site to which that licence relates. These powers only apply to gaming machines for
which it is possible to stake more than £10 in respect of a single game (presently only gaming
machines offering B2 content (for more detail, see (“Information on the Historic Ladbrokes Group”)
section of this Prospectus) and do not apply to betting premise licences that were issued before
24 May 2016. However, this change could impact the number of gaming machines permitted on new
betting premises in Scotland.

**_The CMA has launched an investigation into online betting and gaming_**

On 21 October 2016, the CMA announced an investigation into online betting and gaming, focusing on
potential unfair treatment of customers. This investigation is being undertaken as part of a joint
programme of work with the Gambling Commission on fairness and transparency in the betting and
gaming industry. As part of the preliminary stages of the investigation, the Historic Ladbrokes Group
and the Historic Coral Group have received information notices from the CMA asking them to submit
evidence.

As the investigation is only in its preliminary stages, there is no indication as to what the outcome will
be. However, the investigation may lead to actions being taken by the CMA, including guidance being
issued or enforcement action undertaken. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

35


-----

**_The success of the Group’s business is dependent upon its relationships with government_**
**_authorities and the principal bodies of sport and event industries_**

The Group’s relationships with governmental authorities and regulatory bodies for the betting and
gaming industry, in particular the Gambling Commission in the UK, the Gibraltar Gambling
Commissioner in Gibraltar, the Northern Territory Racing Commission in Australia, ADM in Italy and
the principal regulatory and administrative bodies of certain sport and event industries are significant
factors contributing to the success of the Group’s business.

The Group currently engages with its regulators with regard to the betting and gaming regulatory
framework and other issues of shared concern, such as problem gambling, and with the principal
bodies of sport and event industries with regard to sports rights payments, including levies such as the
statutory Horserace Betting Levy, animal welfare and other issues. The Group has a social
responsibility committee focused on responsible gambling. Furthermore, the Historic Ladbrokes Group
and the Historic Coral Group are founder members of the Senet Group, an independently chaired UK
body which looks to promote and monitor standards in the industry. However, if the Group fails to
maintain such relationships, or if such relationships were adversely affected for any reason, including
as a result of any action or omission on the part of the Group or as a result of negative publicity
concerning the Group or the betting and gaming industry, this could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is vulnerable to increases in taxation and/or levies_**

The Group is subject to taxation and/or levies in all of the countries in which it operates.

The taxation and levies imposed upon betting and gaming companies have changed considerably over
time, and there can be no assurance that the levels of taxation and/or levies to which the Group is
subject in the UK or in any other jurisdiction will not be increased. In addition, many governments are
changing the way they regulate betting and gaming and are introducing new taxation and/or levy
regimes as they do so. For example, the Government of South Australia has announced that it intends
to impose a 15 per cent. POCT on gambling by South Australian residents from 1 July 2017.

As a result, there is a very material risk that new taxes and/or levies could be introduced which are
applicable to the Group and the law or regulations governing existing taxes and/or levies to which the
Group is subject could be amended.

Any such changes to the taxation and/or levies to which the Group is subject may increase the amount
of tax and/or levies payable by it and/or may require it to expend significant capital or other resources
in order to comply with the new or modified obligations. Any or a combination of the foregoing could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, there remains uncertainty as to how the Austrian betting duty regime applied to the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s historic betting exchange business in that country and there is the possibility that a
significant historic liability may arise.

If any company within the Group is found to be, or to have been, tax resident in any jurisdiction other
than the jurisdiction(s) in which that company is currently thought to be (or, as relevant, to have been)
tax resident, or is found to have, or to have had, a permanent establishment in any jurisdiction other
than the jurisdiction(s) (if any) in which that Company is currently thought to have (or, as relevant, to
have had) a permanent establishment (whether on the basis of existing law or the current practice of
any tax authority or by reason of a change in such law or practice), this may have a material adverse
effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group may be subject to increases in payments related to sports and increases in costs_**
**_under contracts with third parties that could result in increases in content costs_**

The Group enters into contracts with regard to, for example, the distribution of television pictures, audio
and other data that is broadcast into its LBOs and the use of software to enable it to provide online
casino and gaming activities. The Group is likely to continue to enter into similar contracts in the future.

36


-----

Increased costs under these contracts could result in increases in content costs, which could have a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Group.

In addition, the Group is subject to, certain financing arrangements intended to support industries from
which it profits, including the statutorily imposed Horserace Betting Levy in the UK, which is intended to
support the British horse racing industry, and the voluntary levy which is collected by the British
Greyhound Racing Fund and is intended to support the greyhound racing industry in the UK. The
Group is likely to continue to be subject to similar financing arrangements in the future, although it
cannot predict with any certainty what levies, subsidies, taxes, fees or other payments or arrangements
may be required for the success of its business in the future. Any material increase in the amount of, or
material change, to such payments currently made by the Group as part of such financing
arrangements, or any requirement to pay additional levies, subsidies, taxes, fees or other payments,
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The Group may be adversely affected by negative publicity and broader political pressure_**
**_surrounding the betting and gaming industry_**

The betting and gaming industry is at times exposed to negative publicity, including in relation to the
use of gaming machines in LBOs, problem gambling, gambling by minors and gambling online.
Publicity regarding problem gambling and other concerns with the betting and gaming industry, even if
not directly connected to the Group and its respective products, could have a material adverse effect
on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. If the perception develops that
the betting and gaming industry is failing to address such concerns adequately, the industry may be
subject to increased regulation or taxation. Any increase in regulation or taxation of the Group could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_There is currently little clarity in relation to the renewal processes for the Italian sports and_**
**_horserace betting licences held by Eurobet Retail_**

For the 2015 calendar year, Eurobet Retail made up approximately 12.5 per cent. of the Historic Coral
Group’s overall net revenue and, now following Completion, it is estimated that Eurobet Retail will
make up approximately 6 per cent. of the Group’s net revenue. Operating licences awarded both in the
Italian retail and online markets are granted for fixed periods, after which a further bid must be
accepted by ADM through a competitive public bidding process in order to renew them. However, there
is little clarity about the renewal process for operating licences in Italy, although there are certain
expectations regarding the timing of this process (as set out below). The current licences held by
Eurobet Retail, which govern its Italian sports and horserace betting operations, were due to expire in
June 2016, but ADM has permitted existing operators, such as Eurobet Retail, to continue to operate
under their current licences in exchange for them extending the date of their guarantees to ADM from
30 June 2017 to 30 June 2018. The new tender documentation for Italian sports and horserace betting
licences is expected to be issued by ADM towards the end of 2016 or early 2017, with the completion
of the process and the assignment of the new licences likely to take place in 2017. A significant part of
the Group’s online business in Italy is derived from “netpoint” customers. These customers are
originally recruited in retail and typically remain loyal through the online business. If these licences are
not renewed, or are made subject to onerous or unacceptable terms and conditions or to inflated costs,
or are renewed in a smaller number, the Group’s ability to operate in the Italian retail market could be
materially adversely affected. In addition, an inability to operate in the Italian retail market would
prevent the Group from attracting further “netpoint” customers and may result in the loss of the Group’s
existing “netpoint” customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the growth of the Group’s
online business in Italy. In addition, the franchise system under which the Group operates its business
in Italy (see “The franchise model operated by the Group in Italy, Belgium and Spain may give rise to
_business risk and unforeseen difficulties may arise”) could be damaged by a reduction in the number of_
operating licences that the Group successfully secures, as franchisees may migrate to competitors,
with an enhanced risk that these franchisees may attempt to migrate the Group’s existing customers
with them, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and
result of operations of the Group.

**_The receipt and holding of customer funds could be regarded as a deposit-taking business_**

The betting and gaming industry is not currently regulated as a deposit-taking business on the basis
that no interest is paid to its customers and that it is an account for services. If this position were to
change, the Group may have to reorganise the way in which it receives payments from its customers
or apply for authorisation to take deposits. Such a change could disrupt the Group’s business and
could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The Group may fail to detect money laundering and/or fraudulent activities and/or fail to comply_**
**_with any licensing objectives that are applicable in the jurisdictions in which it has established_**
**_operations_**

Certain of the Group’s customers may seek to launder money through its business or increase their
winnings through fraudulent activities. The Group has sought to extend best practice with a number of
processes and audit controls to minimise opportunities for money laundering and fraud. If the Group is
unsuccessful in detecting money laundering and/or fraudulent activities, it could suffer loss directly, be
subject to civil or criminal sanctions and/or lose the confidence of their customers, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Fourth Money Laundering Directive ((EU) 2015/849) (“MLD4”) entered into force on 25 June 2015
and EU member states are required to bring national implementing legislation into force by 26 June
2017. The UK Government has recently launched a consultation on the steps that it plans to take to
transpose MLD4 into national Law. The Group’s business falls within the scope of MLD4 and the
Group will be required to comply with the provisions of the relevant implementing legislation. Such
compliance may require the Group to expend significant capital or other resources and/or may require
the Group to modify its product offering or operations, any or a combination of which could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a licensed gambling operator, the Group is required to comply with any licensing objectives that are
applicable in the jurisdictions in which it has established operations. In particular, the Group’s
operations in the UK mean that it is required to comply with the licensing objectives set out in the
Gambling Act 2005 (the “Gambling Act”), which are: (i) keeping crime out of gambling; (ii) ensuring
that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way; and (iii) protecting children and other vulnerable
people from being harmed or exploited by gambling.

Both the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group have been the subjects of public
statements from the Gambling Commission setting out potential issues with their respective
compliance with the Gambling Act’s licensing objectives. Furthermore, in April 2016, the Historic Coral
Group acknowledged that there had been serious shortcomings in its compliance with these objectives
and entered into a voluntary settlement with the Gambling Commission, which included it giving an
undertaking to divest itself of a customer’s gross gambling yield to the sum of £846,664 and making a
payment of £30,000 to cover the costs incurred by the Gambling Commission in investigating the
matter.

The Group will seek to put in place further steps to respond to any shortcomings identified by the
Gambling Commission and already has procedures in place (which the Group intends to maintain)
which seek to ensure that they comply with the Gambling Act’s licensing objectives. However, if the
Group were found to be in breach of their obligation to comply with any licensing objectives that are
applicable in the jurisdictions in which they have established operations, by, for example, failing to
properly comply with the applicable anti-money laundering legislation or failing to meet their social
responsibility obligations, then the relevant authority may impose a financial penalty on them or impose
other penalties, including removing or imposing conditions on the relevant gambling licences. Such
action could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**Risks relating to the marketplace in which the Group operates**

**_The Group’s business may be adversely affected by competition from other betting and gaming_**
**_operators_**

The Group faces competition primarily from other land-based bookmakers, online betting exchanges
and other online betting and gaming operators. These competitors are based both inside and outside
the UK.

Online betting and gaming is characterised by intense and substantial competition between operators
and by relatively low barriers to entry for new participants. Competition is expected to continue to
intensify as new operators start to provide online betting and gaming products and existing operators
improve and expand their product offerings. Furthermore, the Group’s competitors may be better
positioned to take advantage of rationalisation or consolidation (as has been the trend in the betting
and gaming industry recently with a number of significant mergers) and may thereby gain a competitive
advantage or increase an existing competitive advantage over the Group. In addition, the Group faces
competition from market participants operating in, and benefiting from, low tax jurisdictions and those
who benefit from greater liquidity as a result of accepting bets and wagers from jurisdictions from which
the Group does not accept bets and wagers (whether because of legal concerns or otherwise). There
can be no assurance that increased competition from other bookmakers, online betting exchanges and
other online operators, as well as from suppliers of other betting and gaming products, in any segment
of the betting and gaming industry, including the online betting and gaming segment, will not have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The illegal betting market in Italy is of a significant size, and this limits the potential profitability_**
**_of legitimate and regulated betting operations_**

The Group operates in Italy. The illegal or unregulated betting market in Italy is of a significant size,
both online and offline, and by some estimates may be half the size of the regulated betting market.
Illegal or unregulated betting operations do not pay tax to the Italian regulator, and hence they have a
competitive advantage over the Group’s Italian businesses, and may be able to offer more attractive
odds and other products that are not available to the Eurobet Retail businesses as a regulated and
licensed tax-paying entity. The continued existence and potential growth of the illegal or unregulated
betting market in Italy may therefore reduce the growth prospects of the Group’s Italian operations and
may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Demand for the Group’s products and services may be adversely affected by general economic_**
**_conditions and consumer trends beyond the Group’s control_**

As with other industries, demand for the Group’s products and services is influenced by general
economic conditions and consumer trends beyond the Group’s control. There can be no assurance
that the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected by
general economic conditions or consumer trends. In particular, the difficult global economic conditions
over the last eight years are unprecedented in recent history, and if such conditions continue or
worsen, there can be no assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Exposure to UK political developments, including the outcome of the UK referendum on_**
**_membership of the EU_**

On 23 June 2016, a referendum was held on the UK’s membership of the EU, the outcome of which
was a vote in favour of leaving the EU. The result of the referendum means that the long term nature of
the UK’s relationship with the EU is unclear and this seems likely to result in a sustained period of
political and economic uncertainty. Any such uncertainty could result in significant volatility in financial
markets and could adversely affect the value of Sterling. Furthermore, depending on the terms reached
as regards any exit from the EU, it is possible that there may be adverse practical and/or operational
implications for the Group. This is particularly the case because the Group’s online betting and gaming
operations are operated from locations outside the UK, including Gibraltar. The Group is monitoring
political developments to identify and assess the medium to long term implications of the UK’s vote to
exit the EU and the impact that it may have on the business of the Group.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE GROUP**

**Operational and bookmaking risks**

**_The Group may experience significant losses with respect to individual events or betting_**
**_outcomes and in respect of any failure to accurately determine the odds compilations or failure_**
**_in the pricing and trading liability management processes_**

The Group’s fixed-odds betting products involve betting where winnings are paid on the basis of the
stake placed and the odds quoted, rather than derived from a pool of stake money received from all
customers. A bookmaker’s odds are determined so as to provide an average return to the bookmaker
over a large number of events and therefore, over the long term, the gross win percentage for both the
Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group have remained fairly constant.

However, there is an inherently high level of variation in gross win percentage event by event and day
by day. The Group has systems and controls in place which seek to manage bookmaking risks, but
there can be no assurance that these will be effective in reducing the Group’s exposure to this risk. As
a result, in the short term, there is less certainty of generating a positive gross win and the Group may
experience (and the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group have from time to time
experienced) significant losses with respect to individual events or betting outcomes (particularly if
large individual bets are placed on an individual event or betting outcome by high net worth individuals
or other bettors). In addition, the gross win percentage of the high rollers section of the Group’s
business can vary significantly. Any significant losses on a gross win basis could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s cash flows and therefore a material adverse effect on their business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The Group employs a team of odds compilers (who determine the odds at which they will accept bets
in relation to any particular event) and trading liability managers who seek to control liabilities in
relation to the relevant group’s retail, telephone, digital and high rollers businesses. There can be no
assurance that errors of judgement or other mistakes will not be made in relation to the compilation of
odds or that the systems the Group has in place to limit risk will be consistently successful. Any
significant misjudgements or mistakes made by the Group in relation to odds compilation and/or the
failure of their pricing, trading and liability management systems could result in the Group incurring
significant losses on a gross win basis, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition and results of operations.

**_The operations of the Group are reliant on a number of key sites_**

The Group has a number of key sites, in particular Coral Retail’s principal office in Stratford in London,
which is expected to serve as the Group’s principal office for its retail business in the UK, the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s existing principal office and main operations centre at Imperial House in Rayners
Lane in Middlesex (which will remain operational for a transitional period after Completion), the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s premises in Europort in Gibraltar, where the majority of the Historic Ladbrokes
Group’s online gaming operations are based, the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s premises in Tel Aviv in
Israel where the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s digital marketing operations are based, the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s premises in Brisbane, where the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s Australian online
gaming operations are based. Online’s premises in Gibraltar and Eurobet’s central premises in Rome.
The unplanned unavailability of any of the Group’s key locations, whether partial or complete, and for
whatever reason, including natural disasters, terrorist acts, political instability, other acts of war or
hostility or outbreak of infectious diseases might have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure of the Group’s business continuity and IT disaster recovery plans_**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group had put in place business continuity and IT
disaster recovery plans for key trading areas of their respective operations, and the Group will review,
assess and develop, these existing business continuity and IT disaster recovery plans. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group has access to a business continuity site for its core UK business and has made
arrangements for off-site data storage, alternate system availability and remote working for key
operational and senior management. Each of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral
Group have back-up IT systems for business critical systems, generally in different geographic

40


-----

locations from the main system centres and all critical data was replicated in real-time. However,
despite such planning, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to respond effectively to
any significant business interruptions. Any such failure may result in loss of data or loss of business
and adversely affect customers’ experience, which might, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group relies on the experience and talent of key personnel, on its ability to recruit and_**
**_retain qualified employees for the success of its business and the appropriateness of its_**
**_succession planning_**

The successful management and operations of Group is reliant upon the contributions of its senior
management team and other key personnel, including the staff of its bet acceptance centre, who
review referred bets for approval, its odds compilers and online international trading liability managers,
who control the odds compilation liabilities of the Group and the senior management of its online
operations. In addition, the Group’s future success depends in part on their ability to continue to recruit,
motivate and retain highly experienced and qualified employees as well as continue to deliver an
appropriate organisational structure and succession plan to meet their objectives. There is competition
in the betting and gaming industry for skilled personnel, in particular for qualified bet pricing and trading
liability management personnel. Although the Group takes steps intended to protect itself in relation to
the loss of key personnel (such as the inclusion of restrictive covenants and/or “gardening leave”
provisions in the employment contracts of such personnel), the loss of service of any of the Group’s
senior management team or other key personnel, or an inability to attract new personnel, could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is exposed to the risk of failure in their operating structure and employee_**
**_disengagement_**

Failures in the Group’s operating structure as a result of employees failing to understand reporting
lines and accountability procedures could lead to management effectiveness being undermined and
employees becoming disengaged with an associated risk of employee underperformance. Such
failures in the operating structure could materially adversely affect the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations and could also result in reputational damage to the Group.

**_The Group is exposed to the risks of expansion into new geographic regions_**

The Group actively explores opportunities for international expansion of its business as part of its
strategy. The success of any expansion of the business into new geographic regions will depend on a
number of factors, including: (i) the Group’s ability to achieve sufficient scale of operations, to comply
with local regulations, and the legal framework and enforcement environment in the target territory, and
to establish and maintain relationships with key partners, suppliers and regulators; (ii) the presence of
established and entrenched competitors; (iii) difficulties in developing products and services that are
tailored to the needs of local customers; (iv) lack of local acceptance or knowledge of the Group’s
products and services; and (v) lack of recognition of the Group’s brands. There can be no assurance
that any attempted expansion of the business into any new geographic region will not fail and
consequently have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of
operations of the Group.

**_The business of Group is subject to sports schedules_**

The Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the scheduling and
live broadcasting of major sporting events. Disruptions to the scheduling and broadcasting of those
sports may have a material impact on the Group’s results of operations. For example, the scheduling of
major sporting events, including the English Grand National, the Cheltenham Festival, the Premier
League, the European Champions League and, at more infrequent intervals, the FIFA World Cup and
UEFA European Football Championship is of key importance to the business of the Group. The
cancellation, postponement or curtailment of any of these significant sporting events, for example due
to adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts, other acts of war or hostility or the
outbreak of infectious diseases, or cancellation of, disruption to, or postponement of the live
broadcasting and other coverage of such sporting events on television, online and elsewhere, for
example due to contractual disputes, technological or communication problems, the insolvency of a

41


-----

major broadcaster or changes in the broadcaster’s content selection, could materially adversely affect
the operations, financial performance and prospects of the Group.

**_Potential litigation may adversely affect the Group’s activities_**

The Group faces the general risk of potential litigation in connection with its business, its customers, its
employees and its external service providers, suppliers and partners (including the effects of changes
in the laws, regulations or policies or their respective interpretations). Such actions may result in the
Group incurring considerable legal and other costs (including fines and penalties), management’s time
and resources may be diverted, the provision of services may be disrupted, and there may be damage
to the Group’s reputation and brand image or a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
results of operations and financial condition (in each case, whether or not the relevant actions are
successful).

**_The Group has a relatively high fixed cost base as a proportion of their total costs, meaning_**
**_that falls in revenue could have a significant adverse effect on the Group’s profitability_**

The Group has a relatively high fixed cost base as a proportion of their total costs, consisting primarily
of staff and rental costs associated with its betting shop estate. Such costs have recently been
increased by the introduction of the UK national living wage and by the commitment of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group to move to single scheduling as a voluntary only policy in the evenings. This
relatively high fixed cost base means that the Group’s profitability is exposed to any decrease in
revenue if the Group is unable, in the short to medium term, to reduce its costs substantially to mitigate
the effect of any significant falls in revenue or profit. The Group’s profitability therefore is likely to be
more significantly and negatively affected by decreases in revenue than would be the case for a
business with a more flexible cost base. Any decrease in profitability could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The franchise model operated by the Group in Italy, Belgium and Spain may give rise to_**
**_business risk and unforeseen difficulties may arise_**

The Group is licensed to conduct betting and gaming operations in Italy through Eurobet Retail, in
Belgium through Tierce Ladbroke S.A. and in Spain through the Group’s joint venture with Cirsa
Gaming Corporation, Sportium. Eurobet Retail conducts its operations using a franchise model,
whereby Eurobet Retail enters into a franchise agreement with a franchisee operator, who then
establishes a betting office using the Eurobet Retail licence, product and systems infrastructure. Tierce
Ladbroke S.A. also makes use of franchise operators to conduct a majority of its business and a small
element of Sportium’s business is conducted using a franchise model.

If the franchisee operators are ineffective, or the Group is unable to attract and retain experienced
franchisee operators, or if any unforeseen circumstances arise in the operation of the franchise model,
the performance of Eurobet Retail, Tierce Ladbroke S.A and Sportium is likely to be negatively
impacted and this could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results
of operations of the Group.

**_The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group each has a defined benefit pension_**
**_scheme to which they and, now following Completion, the Group, may be required to make_**
**_increased contributions to fund any funding shortfalls_**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group provide retirement benefits for their
respective former and current employees through a number of pension schemes, including two defined
benefit pension schemes.

_Historic Ladbrokes Group Plan_

The Historic Ladbrokes Group defined benefit pension scheme (the “Ladbrokes Plan”) was closed to
new entrants from 1 August 2007 and closed to future benefit build-up from 31 August 2015. The
Ladbrokes Plan’s assets must be held separately from those of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and, now
following Completion, the Group. As at 30 June 2016, the estimated present value of the Ladbrokes
Plan’s funded obligations (on an IAS 19 accounting basis) was £316.2 million and the fair value of the

42


-----

Ladbrokes Plan’s assets was £409.7 million, giving a net asset value of £93.5 million. Under the
current agreement with the trustees of the Ladbrokes Plan, the Historic Ladbrokes Group and, now
following Completion, the Group, will pay into the Ladbrokes Plan £187,500 in respect of each month
from April 2016 to June 2017. Contributions of £62,500 per month towards regular expenses of
maintaining the Ladbrokes Plan are payable from July 2017.

_Historic Coral Group Plan_

The Historic Coral Group defined benefit pension scheme (the “Coral Plan”) was closed to new
entrants from 1 July 2008 and closed to future benefit build-up from 28 September 2013. The Coral
Plan’s assets must be held separately from those of the Historic Coral Group and, now following
Completion, the Group. As at 2 July 2016, the estimated present value of the Coral Plan’s funded
obligations (on an IAS 19 accounting basis) was £375.8 million and the fair value of the Coral Plan
assets was £418.0 million, giving a net asset value of £42.2 million. Under the current agreement with
the trustees of the Coral Plan, the Historic Coral Group has agreed to pay £2.75 million a year into the
Coral Plan up until October 2016, [with the final payment expected to be made on or before 31 October
2016.]

As the value of the assets and liabilities of the Ladbrokes Plan and the Coral Plan can change over
time, including as a result of fluctuations in financial markets (along with changes in legislative
requirements and trustees’ covenant assessments), there is a risk that further contributions over and
above those currently agreed could be required from the Group in the future. Such additional
contributions could have an adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Any incident that raises concerns over the Group’s safety regime could have a material adverse_**
**_reputational and financial impact on the Group_**

The Group is subject to the health and safety requirements that are in place in the countries in which it
operates. As a result, the Group operates a health and safety programme which aims to, among other
things, safeguard employee wellbeing and ensure that employees interact safely with customers. Any
failure in health and safety performance which results in a major or significant health and safety
incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result of that incident including
any potential civil or criminal claims against the Group and/or the Directors, as applicable. Such a
failure could generate significant adverse publicity and have a material adverse impact on the Group’s
reputation, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Failure by the Group to maintain and enhance its dual brands could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations_**

The success of the Group is dependent in part on the strength of the Ladbrokes and Coral brands. The
Ladbrokes and Coral brands are long-established, trusted and widely recognised and that this will
further the development of the Group’s betting and gaming activities. It is expected that, as the betting
and gaming industry becomes increasingly competitive, the success of the Group will be in part
dependent on maintaining and enhancing the strength of all its brands. If the Group’s marketing
strategy is ineffective or if it is, for any other reason, unable to maintain and enhance the strength of
the dual Ladbrokes and Coral brands, then its ability to retain and expand its customer base and its
attractiveness to existing and potential partners may be impaired, and its business, financial condition
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The copyright, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, customer databases and similar intellectual
property of the Group is critical to its success in enhancing the Ladbrokes and Coral brands. The
Group relies on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions in order to protect their intellectual
property. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be adequate, or that third parties will not
infringe upon or misappropriate proprietary rights belonging to the Group. In addition, although the
Group has trademark and copyright protection, enforcement is limited in certain jurisdictions, and the
global nature of the internet makes it impossible to control the ultimate destination of websites.

43


-----

The Group may be the subject of claims of infringement of the rights of others, or party to claims to
determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others. Such claims, whether or
not valid, could require the Group to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, re-brand or reengineer services, acquire licences to third party intellectual property and distract management
attention from the business, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group, following the recent Merger, may not be able to implement successfully its_**
**_business strategy_**

There can be no certainty that, after Completion, the Group will be able to implement successfully the
business strategy set out in the “Strategy of the Group” section of this Prospectus (including in
Australia where there has been a recent change of leadership). No representation is or can be made
as to the future performance of the Group, and there can be no assurance that the Group will achieve
its objectives. The Group’s ability to implement its business strategy may be adversely affected by
factors that cannot currently be foreseen, such as unanticipated costs and expenses, technological
change, severe economic downturn, the level of interest rates, foreign exchange risks, governmental
policy, inflation rates, sector conditions or other changes in economic, political, judicial, administrative,
taxation, or regulatory factors (some of which are discussed in more detail in other risk factors). All of
these factors may necessitate changes to the business strategy described in this Prospectus, or
materially adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations, both in the
short and long term.

**Risks relating to information technology and communications**

**_The market for online betting and gaming products and services is in a state of technological_**
**_change_**

The market for online and mobile betting and gaming products and services is characterised by
technological developments, new product and service introductions, evolving industry standards and
ever-changing consumer trends. There is a risk that the emergence of new products and services, the
evolution of existing ones and changes in consumer trends could render the technology and systems
used by the Group obsolete and such developments will require it to: (i) use leading technologies
effectively, continue to develop its existing technological expertise, enhance its current products and
services and develop new products and services to exploit emerging trends and product
developments; and (ii) continue to improve the performance, features and reliability of their technology
and advanced information systems. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of new internet
technologies or standards could require substantial expenditure to replace, upgrade, modify or adapt
the Group’s technology and systems, which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is highly dependent on technology and advanced information systems that may fail_**
**_or be subject to disruption_**

The Group’s operations are highly dependent on technology and advanced information systems and
there is a risk that such technology or systems could fail or be vulnerable to cyber-crime attacks. In
addition, there can be no assurance that the technology and systems currently used by the Group will
be successful, or that they will not be: (i) subject to damage, computer viruses or cyber-crime,
(ii) rendered obsolete by new technologies and more advanced systems introduced in the industry or
adopted by competitors, or (iii) disrupted for any other reason including natural disasters, terrorist acts,
political instability, other acts of war or hostility or outbreak of infectious diseases. Any failure or
disruption of, or damage to, the Group’s technology or systems could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, new internet
or other technology-based products, services or enhancements offered by the Group may contain
design flaws or other defects and/or require costly modifications or may result in a loss of confidence in
the Group’s products and services by its customers or loss of revenue, any or a combination of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

44


-----

The Group may at any time be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect
against network failure and disruption. If replacements, expansions, upgrades and other maintenance
are not completed efficiently or there are operational failures, the quality of the product and service
experienced by the customer will decline. If, as a result, customers were to reduce or stop their use of
the Group’s products and services, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial conditions and results of operations.

**_The Group’s systems may be vulnerable to hacker intrusion, malicious viruses and other cyber-_**
**_crime attacks_**

As with all digital businesses, the Group’s businesses may be vulnerable to cyber-crime attacks. These
attacks may include distributed denial of service attacks and other forms of cyber-crime, such as
attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorised access to their systems and databases for the
purposes of manipulating results, misappropriation of funds or theft of data. Any such attacks may
cause systems failure and/or business disruption and could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Such attacks are by their nature
technologically sophisticated and may be difficult or impossible to detect and defend against. If the
Group fails to implement adequate prevention measures or should any such prevention measures fail
or be circumvented, its reputation may be harmed and they may face claims or investigations, which in
turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The Group is dependent on card payments for the success of their business_**

The Group currently accepts credit and debit card payments from online and telephone customers and
debit card payments in their other betting shops. The Historic Ladbrokes Group also accepts credit
card payments in its betting shops in the Republic of Ireland. Ladbrokes Australia also has a
Ladbrokes branded Visa debit card through which online winnings can be withdrawn by customers
holding the card. The Group will continue to accept these payment methods and will continue to
operate the Ladbrokes branded Visa debit card. Certain U.S. based card schemes and card-issuing
institutions currently restrict the use of their credit cards for online betting and gaming transactions.
Should all or an additional number of the major card schemes or card issuing companies stop
accepting payment transactions for betting and gaming operations (or if there are any errors or
disruption in the relevant systems or any deterioration in the relevant relationships), the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The Group’s business is dependent on banks, credit card companies, payment processors and other
financial institutions, networks and suppliers to enable funds to be paid in and withdrawn by their
customers. Any disruption in those systems or relationships could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the Group is exposed to the risk of chargebacks. Chargebacks occur when customers, card
issuers or payment processors seek to void credit card or other card payment transactions. Customers
occasionally seek to reverse real money losses through chargebacks. While the Group seeks to
maintain existing control procedures to protect against chargebacks, there can be no assurance that
the Group’s exposure to chargebacks will not adversely affect its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The Group is subject to regulation regarding the use of personal customer data_**

The Group processes large amounts of personal customer data (including name, address, age, bank
details and betting and gaming history) as part of its business and therefore must comply with strict
data protection and privacy laws in all jurisdictions in which it operates. Such laws restrict the Group’s
ability to collect and use personal information relating to players and potential players including the
marketing use of that information. The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group have put
in place both systems and procedures and cyber security mechanisms which seek to ensure that
personal customer data is handled appropriately and in compliance with applicable data protection and
privacy laws. Notwithstanding these measures, the Group is, and will be, exposed to the risk that, as a
result of human error, cyber-crime or otherwise, personal customer data could be wrongfully
appropriated, lost or disclosed, or processed in breach of data protection regulation, by or on behalf of

45


-----

the Group. Such an occurrence could result in the Group facing liability under data protection laws, the
loss of its customers, the loss of goodwill of its customers and the deterrence of new customers, any or
a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) entered into force on
24 May 2016 and will apply in all EU member states from 25 May 2018. The Group will continue to
review and develop existing processes to ensure that customer personal data is processed in
compliance with the GDPR’s requirements, to the extent that they are applicable to the Group, and it
may be required to expend significant capital or other resources and/or modify its operation to meet
such requirements, any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is dependent on a number of third parties for the operation of their business_**

The Group has relationships with a number of key third party suppliers who provide products and
services to the Group, including for the supply of products and services for infrastructure, networks and
telecommunications as well as products and services relating to the delivery of customer-facing
content and services. Many of these suppliers are long-term suppliers of important products and
services. However, the Group exercises little control over many of these third party suppliers and is
reliant on them to perform its services in accordance with the terms of its contracts, which increases its
vulnerability to problems with the products and services they provide.

The Group may not be successful in recovering any losses which result from the failure of third party
suppliers to comply with their contractual obligations to it and third party suppliers may seek to recover
losses from the Group under indemnities or in respect of breaches of obligations or warranties under
their agreements with members of the Group. In addition, some of the services on which the Group rely
are only provided by a very limited number of suppliers and there is a risk that the Group would not be
able to find alternative suppliers to provide these services if the current suppliers failed to comply with
their contractual obligations. Such events and any significant disruption in the supply of products and
services to the Group or failure by these third party suppliers to handle current or higher volumes of
use or any other adverse event affecting the Group’s relationship with them could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is exposed to the risk of over-reliance on external consultants for the operation of_**
**_the business_**

The Group employs a significant number of external consultants to help develop and maintain its IT
systems. As a result, there is a risk that the Group could face operational challenges resulting from a
lack of embedded knowledge about its IT systems and procedures. This dependence on external
consultants may increase the risk of breaches of confidence, loss of core competence in connection
with IT systems and business and reputational damage if such risks materialise. This, in turn, could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Financial risks**

**_The cost of finance could increase or financing could cease to be available_**

The ability of the Group to operate their business depends in part on being able to raise funds. While
the Group currently seeks to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through
the use of borrowings with a range of maturities (and the Historic Ladbrokes Group entered into the
New Facilities Agreement in 2015), there can be no assurance that, over the longer term, the Group
will be able to find lenders who are willing to lend on no worse terms than the Group’s existing
financing arrangements, including the New Facilities Agreement, or at all, or that existing financing
arrangements of the Group will be able to be refinanced on no worse terms, or at all, upon maturity. In
addition, a significant weakening of the financial condition and operating results of the Group could
result in it failing to comply with the covenants in its financing agreements which could, in turn, restrict
its access to financing and capital. An increase in the cost, or lack of availability, of finance and capital
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

46


-----

As at 30 June 2016 the Group’s leverage (combining the leverage of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and
the Historic Coral Group as at that date) was 2.7 times net debt to EBITDA. The Group is targeting a
reduction in leverage to 2.0 times net debt to EBITDA within 18 to 24 months of Completion. The
Group will be aiming to reduce leverage to a medium term target of 1.5-2.0 times net debt to EBITDA.
However, in the event of material interruptions to cash flows, there is a risk that leverage may not
decrease at the rate anticipated, or at all.

**_The Group is subject to risks resulting from currency fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations_**

The Group prepares its respective financial statements in Pounds Sterling and generates a proportion
of its revenues in other currencies. To the extent that revenues are received in currencies other than
Pounds Sterling, and currency exchange rates are unfavourable, the Group may lose some of the
economic value of its revenues in Pounds Sterling terms. If the Group expands its international
operations, it may receive more of its revenue in currencies other than Pounds Sterling.

The Group (and, in particular, Ladbrokes Group Finance plc) is subject to risks resulting from interest
rate fluctuations. The Group (and, in particular, Ladbrokes Group Finance plc) has a substantial level
of financial indebtedness and interest on this indebtedness is a significant cost for the Group. To the
extent that the existing or future indebtedness of the Group bears interest at a variable rate and is
unhedged, changes in interest rates may increase its cost of borrowing, increasing interest expense
and reducing operating cash flows. This could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Historic Ladbrokes Group and, now following Completion the Group, has certain liabilities_**
**_under guarantees in connection with hotel leases relating to the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s_**
**_former hotels division_**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group formerly operated an international chain of full service hotels and resorts
through its hotels division. For the purposes of this business, the Company provided guarantees to
third parties in respect of liabilities of subsidiaries under hotel leases. The Historic Ladbrokes Group
sold its hotels division to Hilton Hotels Corporation on 23 February 2006 but, since the release of each
of these guarantees requires the consent of the beneficiary of that guarantee, not all liabilities under
the guarantees could be discharged at that time. Therefore, the Historic Ladbrokes Group and, now
following Completion, the Group, is exposed to a contingent liability should any of the disposed
subsidiaries default on their obligations under the relevant leases. The Company is committed to
seeking, and has received an undertaking from Hilton Hotels Corporation that efforts will be made to
obtain, releases of these guarantees, which expire between 2017 and 2042.

The Company has an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation in relation to any loss it may incur
under these guarantees. The net financial liability recognised in the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s
balance sheet at 30 June 2016 in respect of these guarantees was £3.2 million.

However, there can be no assurance that Hilton Hotels Corporation will not default on its obligations
under the indemnity. Overall, the maximum exposure was assessed at £202 million as at 30 June
2016. While it is extremely unlikely that claims of such magnitude will be made, if any significant claims
are made under any of the guarantees and Hilton Hotels Corporation fails to meet its obligations under
the indemnity, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES AND CORPORATE STRUCTURE**

_The Issuer has no material assets or sources of revenue except for claims against, and advances_
_made to it by, other Group companies under intercompany loans and assets or liabilities under certain_
_hedging arrangements. The Guarantor is a holding company with no revenue-generating operations of_
_its own. Accordingly, in order to service and repay the Notes, the Issuer must rely on interest and_
_principal payments from Group companies or on intercompany loans advanced to it, and the Guarantor_
_must rely on dividends or other distributions or payments from its subsidiaries._

The Issuer is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the Guarantor and will use the net proceeds from
the sale of the Notes to finance the repayment and cancellation of amounts outstanding under Facility
A of the New Facilities Agreement. Any of the net proceeds from the issue of the Notes not so used will
be used towards the general corporate purposes of the Group, or any member of the Group, including,
without limitation, for working capital purposes. The Issuer intends to service and repay the Notes out
of the payments it receives under these intercompany loan agreements or out of loans advanced to it
by other Group companies. The Issuer has no other material assets or sources of revenue except for
its claims under this and other outstanding intercompany loans, loans advanced to it by other Group
companies and assets or liabilities under certain hedging arrangements. Accordingly, the Issuer’s
ability to service and repay the Notes depends on the ability of the Guarantor and the other debtors
under intercompany loans to service such indebtedness and on the ability of other Group companies to
advance loans to it. Therefore, in meeting its payment obligations under the Notes, the Issuer is wholly
dependent on the profitability and cash flow of the Guarantor and such other Group companies.

The Guarantor is a holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries.
The ability of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries to distribute funds to it by way of dividends, distributions,
interest, return on investments or other payments (including loans) is subject to the profitability and
cash flow of the subsidiaries. These distributions are subject to important restrictions, including
restrictions under English company law on subsidiaries that are incorporated in England and Wales
which prohibit English companies from paying dividends unless they are paid out of profits available for
distribution – in general, the accumulated earnings of the relevant subsidiary.

Generally, the claims of subsidiaries of the Guarantor will have priority over claims of the Guarantor
with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation,
winding-up, dissolution, receivership, insolvency, reorganisation, administration or similar proceeding
relating to such subsidiaries, holders of such subsidiaries’ indebtedness and their trade creditors will
generally be entitled to payment of their claim from the assets of such subsidiaries before assets are
made available for distribution to the Guarantor. The Notes and the Notes Guarantee will therefore be
structurally subordinated to the creditors of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer).

**FACTORS WHICH ARE MATERIAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE MARKET RISKS**
**ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES**

**The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors**

Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own
circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

    - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the
merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by
reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

    - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will
have on its overall investment portfolio;

    - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the
potential investor’s currency;

    - understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any
relevant indices and financial markets; and

48


-----

    - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for
economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear
the applicable risks.

The Notes are complex financial instruments and such instruments may be purchased as a way to
reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their overall
portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in Notes which are complex financial instruments
unless it has the expertise (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the
Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of such Notes and the
impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall investment portfolio.

**Risks related to the Notes generally**

Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the Notes generally:

_Issuer’s call option_

The Notes contain an optional redemption feature, which is likely to limit their market value. During any
period when the Issuer may elect to redeem Notes, the market value of the Notes generally may not
rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any
redemption period.

The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest
rate on the Notes having taken into account the cost of redeeming the Notes. At those times, an
investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as
high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly
lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available
at that time.

_Claims of secured creditors will have priority, with respect to their security, over the claims of_
_unsecured creditors, such as Noteholders_

Claims of the Issuer’s secured creditors, if any, and the Guarantor’s secured creditors, if any, will have
priority, with respect to the assets securing such secured creditors’ debt, over the claims of
Noteholders. In the event that any of the Issuer’s secured debt, if any, or the Guarantor’s secured debt,
if any, becomes due or the relevant creditor thereunder institutes proceedings over the assets that
secure the relevant debt, the Issuer’s assets or, as the case may be, the Guarantor’s assets remaining
after repayment of that secured debt might not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of
the Notes.

_Modification, waivers and substitution_

The Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters
affecting their interests generally and to obtain written resolutions on matters relating to the Notes from
Noteholders without calling a resolution. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all
Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and
Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority, and Couponholders.

The Conditions of the Notes also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Noteholders,
agree to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of,
any of the provisions of the Notes, the Trust Deed or the Agency Agreement, (ii) determine without the
consent of the Noteholders that any Event of Default or potential Event of Default shall not be treated
as such or (iii) the substitution in place of the Issuer of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the
Guarantor as principal debtor under the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons or the substitution in
place of the Guarantor as guarantor in respect of the Notes of a new group holding company of the
Ladbrokes Coral group of companies, in each case in the circumstances and subject to the conditions
described in Conditions 13 (Substitution) and 14.2 (Modification, _Waiver,_ _Authorisation_ _and_
_Determination)._

49


-----

_The covenants contained in the Conditions of the Notes are limited_

In addition to the Negative Pledge described herein, the Conditions of the Notes contain a covenant
that limits the ability of the Issuer, the Guarantor and any other Subsidiary of the Guarantor to incur
Debt unless the Notes have an Investment Grade rating from at least two of the Rating Agencies and
no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) has occurred and is
continuing. Additionally the Conditions of the Notes contain a restriction on the Guarantor’s ability to
consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into, or sell, assign or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, another Person. However, prospective investors
should note that the Conditions of the Notes do not restrict (among other things) the making of
investments or the payment of dividends.

There are, however, a significant number of important exceptions to the financial covenant described
above. These exceptions include (but are not limited to) the Incurrence of Debt of up to £1.45 billion
under revolving credit or similar debt facilities or notes and up to £100 million of finance leases entered
into in the ordinary course of the Group’s business.

These and other exceptions to the financial covenant may in certain circumstances allow members of
the Group to incur significant indebtedness. There can be no assurance that members of the Group will
at all times be able to meet all debt obligations as they fall due.

_Change of law_

The Conditions of the Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of issue of the Notes. No
assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English law or
administrative practice after the date of issue of the Notes, and any such change could materially
adversely impact the rights under, and the value of, the Notes.

_Denominations involve integral multiples: definitive Notes_

The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum of £200,000 plus one or more higher integral
multiples of £1,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral
multiples of £200,000. In such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an
amount which is less than £200,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time
may not receive a definitive Note in respect of such holding (should definitive Notes be printed) and
would need to purchase a principal amount of Notes such that its holding amounts to £200,000.

If definitive Notes are issued, holders should be aware that definitive Notes which have a denomination
that is not an integral multiple of £200,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.

_Because the Temporary Global Note and the Permanent Global Note representing the Notes will be_
_held by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, investors will have to rely on the_
_procedures of those clearing systems for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer and/or_
_the Guarantor_

The Notes will be represented by one or more Global Note(s) which will be deposited with a common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (the “Common Depositary”). Definitive Notes
will only be issued in limited circumstances, as described in Section “Summary of Provisions Relating
_to the Notes while Represented by the Global Notes – Exchange”. Euroclear and Clearstream,_
Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the relevant Global Note. While the
Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear
and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will discharge its
payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to the Common Depositary. A holder of a
beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg to receive payments under the Notes. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor has any
responsibility or liability for the records held relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial
interests in the Global Notes by the Common Depositary.

50


-----

Holders of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not have a direct right to vote in respect of the
Notes so represented. Instead, such holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are
enabled by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

**Risks related to the market generally**

Set out below is a brief description of certain market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk:

_The secondary market generally_

The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a
market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes
easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a
developed secondary market.

_Exchange rate risks and exchange controls_

The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes and the Guarantor will make any payments
under the Notes Guarantee in Sterling. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an
investor’s financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the “Investor’s
**Currency”) other than Sterling. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change**
(including changes due to devaluation of Sterling or revaluation of the Investor’s Currency) and the risk
that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor’s Currency may impose or modify exchange controls.
An appreciation in the value of the Investor’s Currency relative to Sterling would decrease (1) the
Investor’s Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor’s Currency-equivalent value of the
principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor’s Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls
that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest
or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.

_Interest rate risks_

Investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may
adversely affect the value of the Notes. A drop in the level of interest rates prevailing in the market will
have a positive impact on the price of the Notes, as the Notes pay a fixed annual rate of interest.
Conversely, an increase in the interest rate level prevailing in the market will have an adverse impact
on the price of the Notes. For investors holding the Notes until maturity, any changes in the interest
rate level prevailing in the market during the term will not affect the yield of the Notes, as the Notes will
be redeemed at par.

_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks_

Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. and Fitch Ratings
Ltd. [have assigned] credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect
the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may
be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.

**Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments**

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or
review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to
determine whether and to what extent (1) the Notes are legal investments for it, (2) the Notes can be
used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or
pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate
regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Notes under any applicable risk-based capital
or similar rules.

51


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes, after deduction of underwriting fees and commissions, are
expected to be approximately £[Š]. Some or all of the net proceeds from the issue of Notes will be used
to finance the repayment and cancellation of amounts outstanding under Facility A of the New Facilities
Agreement.

Any of the net proceeds from the issue of the Notes not so used will be used towards the general
corporate purposes of the Group, or any member of the Group, including, without limitation, for working
capital purposes.

**INFORMATION ON THE BETTING AND GAMING INDUSTRY**

**1.** **Industry**

The betting and gaming industry includes activities such as bookmaking, on-course and off-course
betting and gaming (through retail, online and mobile channels), gaming machines, local and national
lotteries, casinos, bingo and football pools. The Group operates in the betting and gaming industry in
the UK, Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Spain and Italy. The Group is also active in the online betting and
gaming market in other international territories and to a lesser extent the UK telephone betting market.

The Group faces competition primarily from other bookmakers, other online gaming operators and
online betting exchanges.

**(a)** **UK retail**

The betting and gaming industry in the UK comprises a range of activities, including bookmaking,
casinos, bingo, gaming machines, the National Lottery as well as other lotteries and football pools.

The off-course betting market was established in 1961 in the UK, when the UK Government legalised
off-course betting shops in the UK. The number of shops grew rapidly, and by 1987 there were
approximately 10,300 LBOs in the UK. Since then, the sector has experienced consolidation and a
reduction in the number of LBOs. By 1994, there were 9,670 LBOs in the UK and by 31 March 2016
there were estimated to be 8,809 LBOs.[1] It is estimated that as at 31 March 2016 William Hill had
approximately 26 per cent., the Historic Ladbrokes Group had approximately 24 per cent., the Historic
Coral Group had approximately 21 per cent., Betfred had approximately 16 per cent. and other
operators had approximately 13 per cent. of LBOs in the UK.[2] The Group’s UK retail businesses face
competition from these operators and from a number of other smaller competitors.

Traditionally the core betting products in LBOs were UK horse racing, greyhound racing and multiple
event accumulator bets. However, there have been significant legislative changes over the years which
have enabled bookmakers to improve the quality of their customer offering in the shops and the
environment in which they deliver it.

At the start of this century, there were a number of positive regulatory developments, including a move
to a more favourable gross profits-based tax regime, the introduction of gaming machines and winter
evening opening and the legalisation of advertising, including on television. As a result, LBOs now
provide customers with greater flexibility and offer a far wider range of betting and gaming products. In
recent years, the implementation of the Gambling Act 2005 and Gambling (Licensing & Advertising)
Act 2014 have introduced more formal regulation designed to keep crime out of gambling, make sure
that gambling operators conduct their business in a fair and open way and protect the young and the
vulnerable from being harmed or exploited by gambling. This has led to the development of a number
of regulations which apply to UK licensed operators, which are documented in the Gambling
Commission’s Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice. This has included changes to self-exclusion
arrangements in both retail and digital and requirements to offer customers more responsible gambling
tools, such as time-outs and reality checks, and to operate with greater auto-play restrictions and
improved customer information regarding how customer funds are held and protected. Other changes
in regulation have brought about the introduction of time and spend limit functionality on gaming
machines and the requirement to allow only account based play for stakes of over £50 in any one spin
and an industry code for socially responsible advertising.

While online betting and gaming has been the main factor contributing towards growth in the sector,
retail gross gambling yield (i.e. stakes less customer winnings) has remained stable, totalling £3.2
billion during the period April 2014 to March 2015, which represents growth of approximately 2 per
cent. per year between 2011 and 2015.[3] Additionally, the introduction of the National Lottery in 1994
has contributed to changing social attitudes towards betting and gaming. This, combined with the
increased variety of betting and gaming products offered (football, for instance, has become an
increasing proportion of the Group’s UK OTC gross win), has led to growth in the market. Overall gross

gambling yield totalled approximately £11.2 billion during the period April 2014 to March 2015, and has
grown by approximately 8 per cent. per year between 2011 and 2015, driven primarily by online
development.[4]

New entrants to the UK betting and gaming market face certain practical issues. Applicants are
required to satisfy the Gambling Commission that they are capable of operating in an industry which is
highly regulated in order to be granted the necessary operating licence. Furthermore, the industry
remains competitive with a number of operators.

**(b)** **European retail – Ireland, Belgium, Spain and Italy**

Regulated under the Betting Act 1931, the number of LBOs in the Republic of Ireland has increased
from approximately 700 in 2000 to approximately 900 in 2016. Sports and horse betting is allowed in
registered premises throughout the week (including during evenings all year round, even when no Irish
horse racing is taking place). However, gaming machines are not available. Estimates suggest offcourse betting grew by approximately 32 per cent. between 2003 and 2013 and in 2013 accounted for
in excess of approximately 95 per cent. of the land-based horseracing gambling revenue.[5] It is a highly
fragmented market; at the end of 2014 approximately 79 per cent. of LBOs were controlled by the
Historic Ladbrokes Group, Paddy Power Betfair and Boylesports with the remainder comprising smaller
chains (each with less than 7 per cent. share) and independent shops.[6]

In Belgium, companies may operate sports betting operations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Justice and are liable to pay taxes and levies in Belgium. The licensed shops are restricted to offering
bets on horses, dogs and sports. In Belgium, the current competition to the Group’s retail operations
includes Tipico, Betcenter, Betfirst and Stanleybet.

In Spain, off-course betting is regulated at the regional level. Each ‘autonomous community’, as they
are known, regulates gambling activity independently of the approach adopted by neighbouring
communities. This results in regional variances in restrictions on the products that can be offered, for
example the Basque country does not permit betting on horse racing in retail outlets. To date, 15 out of
17 of the autonomous regions have regulated gambling, with the two remaining communities expected
to regulate soon. Remote gambling in Spain, on the other hand, has been regulated nationally by the
DGOJ since 2011. In Spain, the current competition to the Group’s retail operations includes Codere
and Kirol.

Italy is the largest regulated betting and gaming market in Europe based on gross win, and has
experienced growth in recent years due to improvements in the regulatory environment allowing
operators to introduce new product categories such as virtual racing and bet-in-play. Operating
licences awarded both in the Italian retail and online markets are granted for fixed periods, after which
a further bid must be accepted by ADM through a competitive public bidding process in order to renew
them. There is currently little clarity in relation to the renewal processes for the Italian sports and
horserace betting licences held by Eurobet Retail (for more detail, see the “There is currently little
_clarity in relation to the renewal processes for the Italian sports and horserace betting licences held by_
_Eurobet Retail ” in the part of this Prospectus headed “Risk Factors”). The current licences held by_
Eurobet Retail, which govern its Italian sports and horserace betting operations, were due to expire in
June 2016, but ADM has permitted existing operators, such as Eurobet Retail, to continue operating
under their current licences in exchange for them extending the expiry date of their guarantees to
ADM. In spite of the Italian market becoming legal and regulated at the end of 2006, there remains an
active illegal market. Eurobet Retail’s principal competitors in Italy are Snai, Intralot, GTECH and Sisal.
Eurobet Online’s principal competitors in Italy are Bet365, Snai, Sisal, GTECH, William Hill and Paddy
Power Betfair.[7]

**4** Gambling Commission – Industry statistics – April 2011 to March 2015, p.5. Much of this increase is attributable to the fact
that overseas based operators providing online services to UK customers have been included in the Gambling Commissions
statistics from 1 November 2014 (the date from which such operators have had to be licensed by the Gambling
Commission).

**(c)** **Online betting and gaming**

Online betting and gaming has grown rapidly since it was established in the late 1990s, and increased
broadband penetration and an increase in the usage of mobile devices are widely expected to continue
to drive growth in the market. In the year to June 2016, it was estimated that 16 per cent. of adults in
the UK had participated in online betting and gaming at least once, while 11 per cent. had done so
during the past four weeks.[8] Between November 2014 and September 2015 online activity represented
approximately 30 per cent. of gross gambling yield in the total betting and gaming market in the UK.
According to H2 Gaming Capital, between 2015 and 2021, the global gross win online will increase at a
compounded annual growth rate of 7.2 per cent. for sportsbook, 10.2 per cent. for casino products, 9.3
per cent. for poker products and 9.4 per cent. for bingo products.

The Group faces competition in its online operations from a number of bookmakers (such as William
Hill and Paddy Power Betfair), exchanges such as Smarkets and other online operators based
elsewhere in the UK and overseas (including PartyGaming, 888.com and bwin) that are specifically
targeting the UK and Europe. In Australia, the Group’s main competitors are William Hill, Paddy Power
Betfair, Tabcorp, Tatts, Crownbet and Bet365. Competition in the online marketplace has intensified
and is expected to continue to do so as new operators enter the market and existing operators improve
and expand their product offerings. The competitive environment remains subject to change depending
on regulatory and technological developments.

**2.** **Regulatory environment**

The Group operates in a heavily regulated industry across multiple geographical jurisdictions. The
Group holds (or has held on its behalf) licences to operate in the UK, Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Italy
and Spain, as well as a number of other less material jurisdictions under its Gibraltarian remote
licences. The licences and approvals held by or on behalf of members of the Group are subject to a
number of terms and conditions, breach of which could result in fines, termination or non-renewal of
the licence or approval in question or other regulatory sanctions. The relevant regulatory bodies in
many of these markets have also issued various codes of practice with which the Group must comply.
For instance, in the UK, the Group are required to comply with the Gambling Commission’s Licence
Conditions and Codes of Practice.

As a regulated sector, the betting and gaming industry is subject to anti-money laundering legislation,
such as national legislation implementing the third EU Money Laundering Directive (no. 2005/60/EC)
and, in the UK, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The Group has in place a number of processes to
detect and report suspicious activity, and to handle requests for assistance from law enforcement
agencies and regulators. This is overseen by dedicated anti-money laundering teams.

**(a)** **Retail operations**

There are three licence types that have been issued to members of the Group and their directors and
employees to enable them to operate in the UK. The first is an operating licence issued to the relevant
trading company by the Gambling Commission. Two members of the Historic Ladbrokes Group hold
the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s operating licences. Three members of the Historic Coral Group hold
the Historic Coral Group’s UK operating licences. The second licence type is a personal management
licence. The Gambling Commission specifies certain senior roles within the organisations that must be
undertaken by a personal management licence holder. The Historic Ladbrokes Group as at 25 October
2016 has 42 personal management licence holders. The Historic Coral Group as at 25 October 2016
has 34 personal management licence holders. The third licence type is a premises licence, which is
issued by the relevant local authority. The Group holds separate premises licences for each of their
LBOs.

Each Group LBO in the UK is licensed to provide up to four gaming machines offering B2 Content
(jackpot slot content with a maximum stake of £100[9] and a maximum jackpot of £500) and/or B3
Content (jackpot slot content with a maximum stake of £2 and a maximum jackpot of £500). The

operation of gaming machines is subject to both The Gaming Machine (Circumstance of Use)
Regulations 2007 and the Gambling Commission’s Gaming Machine Technical Standards
requirements.

Other jurisdictions in which the Group will have retail operations include:

(i) Northern Ireland, where the Group is regulated under the provisions of the Lotteries and
Amusements (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 (as amended) with the betting shops estate in
Northern Ireland licensed by the local magistrates’ courts;

(ii) the Republic of Ireland, where the Group is regulated under the Betting Act 1931. Bookmaker’s
licences and betting shop licences are required to operate betting shops in the Republic of
Ireland. Licences must be renewed annually and must be approved by the police and the Office
of the Revenue Commissioners in the Republic of Ireland. Licences cannot be held by
corporations and the requisite licences for the betting shop estate in the Republic of Ireland are
held by individuals on behalf of the Company;

(iii) Belgium, where sports betting is licensed by the Ministry of Justice;

(iv) Spain, where the Group has a retail presence via its joint venture operations, which are
appropriately licensed by the applicable regional regulatory authorities; and

(v) Italy, where Eurobet Retail and Eurobet Online trade under the Eurobet brand. Operating
licences awarded both in the Italian retail and online markets are granted for fixed periods, after
which a further bid must be accepted by ADM through a competitive public bidding process in
order to renew them.

**(b)** **Online operations**

Remote gambling licences for the provision of their online betting and gaming products into the UK are
held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Group.

Other than its Australian, Belgian, Irish (betting and intermediary), Spanish, and UK online operations,
where separate licences are held by the relevant entities or persons, the provision of the Group’s
online betting and gaming products is regulated in Gibraltar and gambling licences for these operations
issued by the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority are held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the
Historic Ladbrokes Group. The Group use their Gibraltarian gambling licences for regulated territories
where licences are not already held and they are legally permitted to provide remote gambling facilities
into that territory under their Gibraltarian licences. The Betdaq business, as regards business to
business activities, is regulated in Alderney.

In Australia, interactive and internet gambling is regulated by each individual state, in each case
applicable to gaming and sports betting activities conducted within such a state, and the Interactive
Gambling Act 2001 (Cth), which purports to regulate certain types of interactive and internet gambling
occurring both within and outside Australia. A gambling licence issued by the Northern Territory Racing
Commission is currently held by or on behalf of the relevant members of the Historic Ladbrokes Group
and although each state has its own form of gambling regulation, that licence permits the Company to
offer gambling facilities throughout Australia, but taking into account any specific individual state’s
regulation.

In addition, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, Ladbrokes Digital Australia Pty Ltd, is regulated by
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission under chapter 7 of the Corporations Act
2001 (Cth). Ladbrokes Digital Australia Pty Ltd is required to be licensed in Australia, because it
arranges non-cash payment products and in doing so, is taken to be providing general financial
product advice in Australia. Specifically, the non-cash payment products concerned are the Ladbrokes
Visa Debit Card and Ladbrokes EFTPOS Card. Ladbrokes Digital Australia Pty Ltd has an Australian
Financial Services Licence Authorising it to engage in these activities.

The Group’s online businesses accept bets and wagers in each territory where they are licensed to do
so. However, people accessing the Group’s websites in respect of gambling transactions under the
Group’s Gibraltarian licences may be located in any country and, whilst the Group has measures in
place to prevent customers gambling on their websites from territories where it is known they are not
legally permitted to do so, it is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that transacting with the Group is
legal in the jurisdiction in which they are located, which is made clear in the terms and conditions of
each of the Group’s websites.

58


-----

Regulation of online betting, in particular, is still an evolving area in many jurisdictions. The Group’s
legal and regulatory teams actively monitor developments in respect of all jurisdictions in which they
believe there are material risks to their respective groups. The Group has taken the decision that they
will not accept online business from customers located in certain jurisdictions, such as the United
States and many others. The list of restricted territories for which the Group will not accept online
business is kept under review and the situation monitored by specific working groups to make sure that
the Group continues to operate only in territories where it believes it is legally entitled to do so.

Where considered necessary, the Group obtains independent legal advice concerning the scope and
applicability of gambling laws and regulations in respect of particular jurisdictions. This advice is used
to modify the Group’s approach in relation to doing business in that jurisdiction on a case-by-case
basis and, based on the relevant jurisdiction, the Group undertakes procedures in order to mitigate any
such risks. The Group has systems and controls in place which seek to ensure that the Group offers
gambling products via the internet into jurisdictions from which it has determined it does not wish to
accept transactions. The systems and controls include monitoring and analysing information provided
by potential customers’ registered addresses and IP addresses.

**(c)** **Costs of content**

_UK Horserace Betting Levy_

The British betting industry supports the British horse racing industry via the Horserace Betting Levy, a
subsidy based on the gross win from bets struck in the UK on horse races held in the UK. This levy
arrangement has been established on a statutory basis since off-course betting was legalised in 1961.
The Horserace Betting Levy is an annual scheme with representatives of all classes of bookmakers
(comprising the Bookmakers Committee) responsible to the Horserace Betting Levy Board for
recommending the basis of each year’s scheme. When the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the
Bookmakers Committee cannot agree a basis, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
determines the outcome. For the 2016/17 scheme, the Secretary of State directed that the Horserace
Betting Levy continue to be set at 10.75 per cent. of profits from betting on UK horse racing.

In March 2016, the UK Government announced proposals to reform the Horserace Betting Levy so that
it will apply to all bookmakers who take bets on UK horse racing (including remote betting operators, to
whom the Levy does not currently apply). The proposed reforms are currently expected to take effect
from April 2017. Recent correspondence from the UK’s Department of Culture, Media and Sport,
suggests that the new fee, for both UK retail and online operators, is likely to be set at 10 per cent. of
gross profits from betting on UK horse racing.

_UK Greyhound levy_

The Group contributes voluntarily to the British Greyhound Racing Fund, which is the official funding
body for greyhound racing in Great Britain as licensed by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain:
www.bgrf.org.uk.

Grants from the British Greyhound Racing Fund cover all aspects of welfare, integrity, development
and promotion of the sport and the British Greyhound Racing Fund works closely with the Greyhound
Board of Great Britain. In the financial year 2015-2016, bookmakers were requested to pay 0.6 per
cent. of their greyhound turnover to the British Greyhound Racing Fund.

_Other sports_

Whilst the Group pays licence fees to content suppliers for their established intellectual property rights,
the Group does not pay for the right to bet on other sports.

59


-----

**3.** **Responsible gambling**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group has always placed great emphasis on being a responsible business,
advocating and maintaining high standards across its sector, particularly with respect to its
understanding of responsible gambling behaviours and the options for harm minimisation. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group are active participants of the Association of British
Bookmakers’ and Remote Gambling Association’s responsible gambling committees. In addition, the
Historic Ladbrokes Group was a key instigator in setting up the Industry Group on Responsible
Gambling and the Historic Ladbrokes Group and Historic Coral Group are founder members of the
Senet Group.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group has a dedicated Social Responsibility Committee to oversee delivery
against the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s responsible gambling objectives. The Committee will continue
to fulfil this function in respect of the Group.

Responsible gambling has also been a key focus of the Historic Coral Group and this responsibility is
taken extremely seriously. A gambling committee chaired by the former Gala Coral CEO has involved
all operating divisions and reported to the board of Gala Coral on progress at every meeting. While the
vast majority of customers play within their limits, the Group recognises its responsibility to potentially
vulnerable gamblers.

**INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGER**

**1.** **Background to and reasons for the Merger**

**(a)** **The Merger**

The Merger completed on [1 November] 2016. The Group (which is now made up of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group) will be one of the leading European betting and
gaming groups providing its customers with a wide choice of products and flexibility across channels.

The combination of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group is compelling
strategically and is attractive as a platform for long-term growth. There are five opportunities that have
been identified and will be central to the overall strategy of the Group, which are: (i) the creation of a
group with the potential to deliver faster online growth; (ii) the creation of a group with the UK’s largest
LBO estate; (iii) the creation of a group with an extensive international portfolio of regulated
businesses; (iv) the delivery of significant synergies underpinning Shareholder returns; and (v) the
creation of a group with an enhanced and integrated technology platform.

_The potential to deliver faster online growth_

It is expected that, on a combined basis, the online business of the Group will generate approximately
25 per cent. of revenues and would be a substantially increased player in the UK online market as a
result of the Merger.

Digital sports betting and gaming remain the key growth opportunities in the market and the Merger
enables the Group to drive further online growth. This will be delivered through enhanced multi-channel
and marketing capabilities, and the ability to deploy shared innovation across multiple brands.

An effective multi-channel offering delivers higher value to customers at lower cost and enhances
customer experience, driving loyalty. The Historic Coral Group has already deployed market leading
multi-channel technology across its estate. The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s multi-channel programme
launched in July 2015 has now delivered over 130,000 signups. Metrics such as player value and
retention associated with these players continue to look strong compared to core digital players. The
Group intends to take the best from both the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s and the Historic Coral Group’s
multi-channel technology to enhance its overall omni-channel offer.

The Group intends to operate a dual-brand strategy in the UK across both its retail and its digital
businesses. The Board believes that this is the optimal route to maximising the value of the Group’s
customer bases. The intention is to continue to offer customers distinctive products and promotions.
Where appropriate, the Group will leverage product innovation and technology across both brands in
particular through multi-channel which will be central to generating digital growth. In digital, where
customers typically have multiple betting applications on their smartphone, the Group will aim to be two
of these applications rather than one. The Group also is expected to be able to use its sophisticated
customer analytical tools to anticipate the actions of players, thereby allowing it to present attractive
personalised offers from the second brand to online customers who are expected to be about to churn.

The use of dual brands does not limit the delivery of synergies – the Group expects to combine its core
trading platforms, IT systems and retail governance teams, and through dual-brand sourcing deliver
procurement synergies in certain key categories of marketing spend. IT integration planning is well
advanced and a plan has been put in place for the integration of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s and
the Historic Coral Group’s IT systems.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group also intend to pool their digital innovation
teams in order to strengthen the product pipelines of the Group. The Group will continue to focus on
delivering innovation across its multiple brands, with a view to enhancing returns.

The Group will have market leading technology supporting its online operations. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group currently use similar technology platforms, including
partnerships with suppliers such as Playtech, OpenBet and Scientific Games. This commonality is
expected to accelerate integration without causing any material disruption to the customers of the
Group.

61


-----

_The UK’s largest LBO estate – strongly cash generative, more efficient and sustainable in the long_
_term_

The Group’s dual-brand strategy will ensure that its customers can retain their brand preference. The
combined retail estate of the Group will continue to build on its track record of product innovation.

The Merger also represents an opportunity to improve further shop efficiency through the reduction of
central overheads and through joint procurement. This will make the Group’s UK retail estate more
resilient in the face of recent taxation increases.

_Disposals_

On 26 July 2016, the CMA published its final conclusions in relation to the Merger in which it stated
that the Merger could proceed subject to the divestment of 350 to 400 LBOs, and that Completion of
the Merger could occur when the LBO divestment process was substantially complete.

On 15 October 2016:

(a) Ladbrokes Betting & Gaming Limited entered into: (i) a business transfer agreement to sell
168 LBOs to Betfred; and (ii) a business transfer agreement to sell 17 LBOs to StanJames; and

(b) Coral Racing Limited entered into: (i) a business transfer agreement to sell 154 LBOs to Betfred;
and (ii) a business transfer agreement to sell 20 LBOs to Stan James.

On 21 October 2016, Ladbrokes Betting & Gaming Limited entered into a further business transfer
agreement, on substantially the same terms as the Business Transfer Agreements, with Bet 21 Limited
in respect of the sale of 1 LBO to Bet 21 Limited, the Additional Transfer Agreement.

The aggregate number of LBOs being sold to Betfred is 322 for a cash consideration of £55.0
million. The aggregate number of LBOs being sold to Stan James is 37 for a cash consideration of £0.5
million. The Business Transfer Agreements were entered into on substantially similar terms. The
Business Transfer Agreements contain certain customary warranties and indemnities in relation to the
business and assets transferring to the Purchasers, including an indemnity in respect of all matters
arising in connection with the operation of the relevant business prior to completion of the relevant
Business Transfer Agreement.

On 26 October 2016 the CMA approved the purchasers, the LBO disposal packages and the terms of
the Business Transfer Agreements and the Additional Transfer Agreement. Descriptions of the
Business Transfer Agreements have been included in sections 6 and 7 of Part XIII (Additional
Information) of this Prospectus.

_An extensive international portfolio of regulated businesses_

It is expected that the international operations will represent approximately 13 per cent. of the Group’s
revenue.

The Group will have strong retail and online operations in Italy (number two online), Belgium (number
one in retail) and Spain (number one in retail) and an attractive and rapidly growing online operation in
Australia (number three corporate bookmaker).

Combining the substantial experience gained from these operations with the enhanced financial
resources of the Group provides a foundation for future international growth.

_Significant synergies underpinning Shareholder returns_

It is expected that the Group will be able to achieve recurring annual pre-tax cost synergies of at least
£65 million as a result of the Merger. The Company expects these synergies to be phased in over the
three years after Completion.

_An enhanced and integrated technology platform_

To assist in providing the flexibility for the Group to achieve integration and realise synergies from the
combination of the Historic Coral Group’s and the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s digital businesses,
Playtech has agreed with the Company to amend the existing Marketing Services Agreement with the
Company.

62


-----

As part of this arrangement, Playtech and the Company have agreed to accelerate the determination of
amounts due to Playtech under the Marketing Services Agreement. The sum agreed is £75 million, of
which £40 million was satisfied by way of the issue of shares in the Group on Completion (the
“Playtech Issue”) and with a further guaranteed £35 million in cash paid upon delivery by Playtech of
key operational milestones but, in any event, within 42 months following Completion.

This will accelerate the integration of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s and the Historic Coral Group’s
digital platforms and therefore the delivery of cost synergies. The additional benefits of this agreement
are not reflected in the synergy estimate and would reflect incremental value generation for the Group.

**(b)** **Integration review**

At the time of the Circular, the directors of the Company and the directors of Gala Coral recognised
that, to achieve some of the expected benefits of the Merger, it would be necessary to undertake a
review of how best to integrate the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group. The
Integration Review has now commenced and a steering committee has been established to coordinate
integration planning. However, prior to the completion of the Merger, the Historic Ladbrokes Group and
the Historic Coral Group were separate groups of companies and data sharing was subject to certain
restrictions for commercial and competition law reasons.

The Integration Review has started to put together plans to integrate the Group’s operations and
resources to ensure that the optimal combination is achieved post-Completion. In addition, the
Integration Review has resulted in some proposed changes to the locations of the Group’s places of
business and work is currently being done to determine whether any fixed assets of the Group will be
required to be redeployed. The analysis carried out to date has indicated the potential to generate cost
synergies for the Group in areas where there is an overlap of functions. Although the number of
employees actually affected by the Merger will depend on the outcome of the Integration Review, it is
estimated that there will be a decrease of approximately 3 per cent. of the Group’s full-time equivalent
employees.

The existing contractual and statutory employment rights of all employees of the Historic Coral Group
and the Historic Ladbrokes Group will be fully respected following Completion save to the extent that
the location of the places of business of the Group are impacted by the Integration Review.

It is not envisaged that contributions into the Company pension schemes, the accrual of benefits for
existing members or the admission of new members will be impacted by the Merger.

**(c)** **Financial effects of the Merger**

Having reviewed and analysed the potential benefits of the Merger and taking into account the factors
that the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group can influence, it is expected that the
Group, comprising both the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group in their entirety, will
be able to achieve recurring annual pre-tax cost synergies of at least £65 million as a result of the
Merger. The Group expects these synergies to be phased in over the three years after Completion with
approximately 35 per cent. delivered in year one, 85 per cent. in year two and 100 per cent. by the end
of year three, post-Completion.

The principal sources of quantified cost synergies are as follows:

(i) approximately £7 million from reduced corporate costs; and

(ii) approximately £58 million through combining the retail and digital operations, by eliminating
duplicated activities where appropriate and by streamlining general and administration costs
across the two operations. It is expected that these savings will be realised approximately 60 per
cent. in retail and approximately 40 per cent. in digital operations, respectively.

It is expected that the realisation of the quantified cost synergies will result in non-recurring costs of
approximately 1.25 times annual quantified synergies, predominantly in the first year after Completion.
Aside from these costs, no material cost dis-synergies are expected in connection with the Merger.

63


-----

In addition to the quantified cost synergies outlined above, the Group expects further upside from
cross-brand marketing, exchange of expertise relating to product innovation and the transfer of
operational best practices.

The Retail Disposals are not expected to impact the quantified cost synergies or non-recurring costs of
implementation. The associated revenue and EBITDA for the LBOs that are being transferred for the
most recent full financial year for both the Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group is
£12.8 million and £13 million, respectively.

The Board believes the financial benefits will accrue as a direct result of the Merger and could not be
achieved independently. The estimated synergies reflect both the beneficial elements and the relevant
costs.

**2.** **Current trading and prospects**

**_Historic Ladbrokes Group_**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group issued its trading update for the three months ended
30 September 2016 on 18 October 2016 (the “Q3 Trading Update”). The Q3 Trading Update is
incorporated by reference into this Prospectus. Trading for the period from 30 September 2016 to the
date of this Prospectus has been and is in line with the expectations of the Directors and there has
been no material change to the financial position of the Historic Ladbrokes Group.

**_Historic Coral Group_**

The period post 2 July 2016 represents the 15 week period to 16 October 2016 incorporating the
12 week period to 25 September 2016 (fourth quarter of the financial year ended 25 September 2016)
and the subsequent 3 week period to 16 October 2016.

**12 week period to 25 September 2016 (fourth quarter of 2016 financial year):**

Trading in the 12 week period to 25 September (fourth quarter of 2016 financial year was positive with
Coral Group net revenue 8.9 per cent. ahead of last year (year to date +11.3 per cent.).

Coral Retail total net revenue grew 0.3 per cent, driven by an improvement in OTC gross win margin
and machines growth.

Eurobet Retail net revenue was 31.2 per cent. ahead of last year, with strong growth in sports stakes.

Online saw continued strong growth with net revenue 23.7 per cent. ahead of last year (year to date
+28.3 per cent.) with Coral.co.uk net revenue 31.7 per cent. ahead driven by strong sports stakes
growth.

**3 week period to 16 October 2016**

The Historic Coral Group’s net revenue was ahead of last year, with growth in all divisions except Coral
Retail which was marginally behind.

Trading for the period from 16 October 2016 to the date of the Merger Prospectus has been in and is in
line with the expectations of the Historic Coral Group and there has been no material change to the
financial position of the Historic Coral Group since that date.

**3.** **Strategy of the Group**

The Group’s strategy will seek to exploit the combined strengths of the Historic Ladbrokes Group and
the Historic Coral Group, and will initially focus on the following strategic opportunities.

_Developing multi-channel_

Digital sports betting and gaming remain the key growth opportunities in the market. The Group will
seek to leverage its strong positions in the OTC sports betting markets of the UK, Belgium, Ireland,
Italy and Spain to drive further online growth.

64


-----

The Group combined multi-channel experience of the “Grid” and “Coral Connect” will allow it to provide
the market leading omni-channel offering in the sector. The Group intends to take the best from both of
these products to enhance its overall omni-channel offering.

_Maintaining dual brands in the UK_

The Group intends to operate a dual-brand strategy in the UK across both its retail and its digital
businesses. It is expected that this is the optimal route to maximise the value of the Group’s customer
bases. The intention is to continue to offer customers distinctive products and promotions. Where
appropriate, the Group will leverage product innovation and technology across both brands, in
particular in multi-channel, which will be central to generating digital growth. In digital, where customers
typically have multiple betting applications on their smartphone, the Group will aim to be two of these
applications rather than one. The Group is also expected to be able to use its sophisticated customer
analytical tools to anticipate the actions of players, thereby allowing it to present attractive and
personalised offers from the second brand to online customers who are expected to be about to churn.

_Pursuing international opportunities_

The Group will review and seek opportunities in international markets both to enhance its existing
international portfolio, but also to manage the risk of an over reliance on its core UK market.
Opportunities that allow the Group to leverage its sports betting expertise and cross sell into its gaming
knowledge will be the basis for its review of international opportunities. However, international markets
with a strong gaming customer base in which the Board believes the Group can grow market share
shall continue to be front of mind.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group and the Historic Coral Group’s combined expertise in working with
regulators and the development of the Group’s regulatory and compliance experience will prepare the
Group for working with international partners if the opportunity appears and with the Group’s scales,
brands and product innovation the Group will have much to offer international partners if such a
partnership is of benefit to the Group.

**4.** **Dividend policy**

The Company announced on 24 July 2015 a total dividend of 3p per Ordinary Share for the full year in
2015 (consisting of 1p paid as an interim dividend and 2p paid as a final dividend) with dividends
remaining at this level until underlying earnings per share cover exceeds two times underlying earnings
per share, at which time a two times dividend cover policy would be adopted consistent with this policy,
Ladbrokes announced an interim dividend of 1p on 4 August 2016. The Group’s dividend policy will
initially consist of a dividend of a minimum of 3p per Ordinary Share per annum (consisting of 1p paid
as an interim dividend and 2p paid as a final dividend) before increasing progressively in the medium
term to a 2 times dividend cover policy.

**5.** **Conduct Agreement**

The Company, Coral, the Four Principal Coral Shareholders and the Coral Management Shareholders
entered into the Conduct Agreement on 24 July 2015 pursuant to which the Four Principal Coral
Shareholders and the Coral Management Shareholders agreed certain restrictions in relation to the
Consideration Shares.

Pursuant to the Conduct Agreement, the parties have agreed that the Consideration Shares issued to
Coral at Completion will be transferred from Coral to the ultimate shareholders of Gala LuxCo as soon
as reasonably practicable after, and in any event within 10 Business Days from, Completion. However,
Coral shall be permitted to withhold documents of title in respect of 5 per cent. of the Consideration
Shares to which each of the ultimate shareholders of Gala LuxCo is entitled for 180 day period postCompletion. In addition, Coral shall, as agent for the ultimate shareholders of Gala LuxCo, be
permitted to sell such number of any Consideration Shares so retained as is necessary to enable Coral
to meet any claims from the Company under the Merger Agreement.

_Standstill and lock-up_

The Conduct Agreement provides that, during the period from signing of the Conduct Agreement until
six months post-Completion, Coral, the Four Principal Coral Shareholders and Coral Management
Shareholders will not buy Ordinary Shares or announce any offer to acquire the Company.

In addition, for a period of 180 days post-Completion, Coral, the Four Principal Coral Shareholders and
Coral Management Shareholders are prohibited (subject to certain customary exceptions) from selling,
transferring or disposing of any of the Consideration Shares. However, Coral is entitled to sell up to
£40 million of Consideration Shares post-Completion. Orderly sale provisions apply (subject to certain
customary exceptions) to Consideration Shares held by the Four Principal Coral Shareholders (subject
to each continuing to hold a minimum percentage of Ordinary Shares) and the Coral Management
Shareholders (subject to the relevant individual being a PDMR of the Company) for a period of
180 days following the initial lock-up period so as to ensure the maintenance of an orderly market for
Ordinary Shares. In addition, the Conduct Agreement obliges Coral, the Four Principal Coral
Shareholders and the Coral Management Shareholders to make it a condition of the Distribution that
each other Gala LuxCo shareholder agrees to be bound by the same lock-up restrictions and, to the
extent that such Gala LuxCo shareholder is interested (directly or indirectly) in 2 per cent. or more of
the Ordinary Shares, the same orderly sale restrictions.

**INFORMATION ON THE HISTORIC LADBROKES GROUP**

**1.** **Introduction and history**

**(a)** **Introduction**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group is a bookmaker that primarily operates in the UK, Australia, Belgium,
Ireland and Spain and which enjoys strong brand recognition in its key markets. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group provides betting and gaming services across multiple channels and markets with
£1.2 billion of net revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.

As at 25 October 2016, the Company had 2,140 LBOs in Great Britain. These outlets provide betting
opportunities on a wide range of sporting and non-sporting events. In addition, as at 25 October 2016,
the Company had approximately 218 LBOs in Ireland (including Northern Ireland) and 453 LBOs in
Belgium and approximately 1,721 outlets situated in Spain, where betting services are available
through the Sportium brand (the joint venture with Cirsa Gaming Corporation, S.A.). The Company also
operates an online betting and gaming business, offering innovative products through Ladbrokes.com
and Ladbrokes Australia.

**(b)** **History and development**

The Company was incorporated in England and Wales on 16 May 1956 under the Companies
Act 1948 and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1967. The Issuer was incorporated in
England and Wales on 14 June 1979 under the Companies Act 1948.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s experience in wagering and betting extends back to 1886 when
Mr Schwind and Mr Pennington went into partnership as commission agents, principally with the
objective of backing horses trained by Pennington at Ladbroke Hall in Worcestershire. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group gained its name in 1902 when Arthur Bendir joined the partnership and changed the
emphasis of the business from backing horses to laying them as a bookmaker. The business
experienced a further step-change when Cyril Stein and his uncle, Max Parker, purchased the firm in
1956. Immediately following the acquisition, the firm introduced ‘no limit’ and ‘ante post’ betting and
sponsored its first horse race. The Historic Ladbrokes Group diversified into other businesses in the
1970s, including the hotel business. In 1987, the Historic Ladbrokes Group acquired the Hilton
International hotels division.

In 2006, the Historic Ladbrokes Group sold its hotel business and returned to its traditional core betting
business. The Historic Ladbrokes Group has focused on expanding this business in recent years,
launching its online betting and gaming business in 2000 and entering the Spanish market through a
retail joint venture under the Sportium brand with Cirsa Gaming Corporation, S.A. in 2008. In 2013, this
was expanded to include a digital offering under the Sportium brand. Also in 2013, the Historic
Ladbrokes Group expanded into Australia with the purchase of Gaming Investments Pty Ltd. This
transaction was accompanied by the launch of Ladbrokes.com.au.

In 2013 the Historic Ladbrokes Group established a product and marketing services partnership with
Playtech, designed to drive growth in digital products, and, in December 2013, a new mobile service
was launched on Playtech’s Mobenga platform. By April 2014, the migration of products to Playtech’s
gaming software was largely complete.

In July 2015, the Company undertook a placing of 92,378,680 Ordinary Shares, which as at
24 July 2015 represented approximately 9.99 per cent. of the Company’s existing Ordinary Shares
(excluding treasury shares (the “2015 Placing”). The 2015 Placing raised proceeds of £115.5 million
(net of expenses), which has been used to strengthen the balance sheet of the Historic Ladbrokes
Group, which will provide additional financial flexibility to manage and grow the Group’s business.

**2.** **Business overview**

**(a)** **Products**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s business consists of offering a variety of betting and gaming products
to retail and online customers and a variety of betting products to telephone customers.

67


-----

**Betting**

Betting products are products where the Historic Ladbrokes Group offers odds on an event occurring,
which give rise to either a liability to make a certain payment to a customer or the retention by the
Historic Ladbrokes Group of the stake placed by such customer. The odds offered by the Historic
Ladbrokes Group in such cases vary depending on the nature of the event. The Historic Ladbrokes
Group makes money where the amounts staked by customers and retained by it are more than the
Historic Ladbrokes Group’s liability to make payments to customers. In fixed-odds betting, the liability
to make payment is in principle unlimited, but the Historic Ladbrokes Group is not obliged to accept
any bets, or may accept bets on certain conditions only (for example, to limit maximum exposure), in
order to manage its overall liabilities. In pool betting products, there is no liability to make payment
greater than the total percentage of the amount of money staked by customers that the operator has
promised to offer in prizes.

Sports betting is provided through all of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s business channels. The most
popular sport on which the Historic Ladbrokes Group offers odds is horse racing, followed by football.
The Historic Ladbrokes Group also offers odds on many other sports including rugby, cricket, tennis,
golf, motor racing, greyhound racing, darts, snooker, American football, baseball, basketball and ice
hockey. The Historic Ladbrokes Group accepts a range of different types of bets from simple bets on
the outcome of a single event to more complex bets, such as accumulator bets on the outcome of a
number of different races or sporting events.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group also accepts bets on non-sporting events through all of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s business channels, such as bets on the outcome of political elections, television
competitions, popular music chart results and high profile novelty bets. The Historic Ladbrokes Group
also takes bets on events the outcome of which is based on chance. For example, numbers betting is a
type of fixed-odds bet in which customers place bets on the odds of one or more numbers being drawn
from a pool of numbers. It is presented in a variety of formats such as the Irish Lottery and is the basis
of computer-generated virtual horse or greyhound racing.

**Gaming**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group also offers a number of gaming products such as slots, casino games,
bingo, poker and other skill games. Gaming products are games the outcome of which is dependent on
chance, such as roulette, pontoon, blackjack and other table games or slot machine games. Skill
games are games where, though partly based on chance, it is argued that the odds can be changed
over the long run based on the application of skill. This applies in games between customers, such as
poker.

With gaming products, the customer bets against the house and the Historic Ladbrokes Group makes
its profit based on probabilities in the long run of different events occurring and uses “house” rules and
procedures to apply risk limits. In skill games, the Historic Ladbrokes Group acts as the host or
facilitator for customers who play against one another. Accordingly, the Historic Ladbrokes Group
takes no principal gaming risk. In return for facilitating these games, the Historic Ladbrokes Group
charges its customers a type of commission, in poker known as a ‘rake’, except in tournaments where
a one-off entry fee is charged. Customers for skill games can compete online against each other either
on individual tables or in tournaments.

**(b)** **Principal channels of product delivery**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group delivers its betting and gaming products to customers through retail
betting outlets and its online channel. The Historic Ladbrokes Group is organised into five business
divisions:

Other regulated operations include the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s digital activities in Belgium and

Historic Ladbrokes Group’s significant and long-standing retail presence in Belgium. Over the last year,
the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s digital joint venture in Spain, Sportium.es, has invested heavily in La
Liga sponsorship and associated La Liga promotional campaigns as it looks to acquire customers and
increase scale. In the second quarter of 2015, the Historic Ladbrokes Group closed its Danish online
business, which had been loss making for some time. The other regulated operations segment of the
digital business had net revenues of £4.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2015. For the half

half year ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), the European retail business had net revenues of £64.4
million and accounted for 9.7 per cent. of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s net revenue (excluding high
rollers).

_Ireland (including Northern Ireland)_

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s business in the Republic of Ireland went through an examinership
process in 2015. This process led to a substantial reduction in the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s Irish
estate and nearly 90 people left the business (almost all of these opted to do so under the voluntary
redundancy scheme). As at 25 October 2016, the Historic Ladbrokes Group had 141 outlets in the
Republic of Ireland and 77 in Northern Ireland. The Irish retail business had net revenues of £64.2
million for the year ended 31 December 2015. For the half year ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), the
Irish retail business had net revenues of £32.4 million.

_Belgium_

As at 25 October 2016, the Historic Ladbrokes Group had a total of 453 Belgian outlets, including both
Ladbrokes shops and newsagent outlets. A majority of the Company’s operations in Belgium are
conducted using a franchise model, whereby the Company enters into a franchise agreement with a
franchisee operator, who then establishes a betting office using the Company retail licence, product
and systems infrastructure.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group has recently introduced virtual betting products and SSBTs to enhance
the quality of offering in its Belgian retail estate. Since the introduction of virtual betting, the Belgian
regulator has been reviewing the manner in which virtual betting can be offered to customers in betting
shops and potential requirements for further regulation. This process is ongoing. The Belgian retail
business had net revenues of £55.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2015. For the half year
ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), the Belgian retail business had net revenues of £32.0 million.

_Spain_

The Historic Ladbrokes Group has a significant retail presence in Spain through its joint venture with
Cirsa Gaming Corporation, Sportium. As at 25 October 2016, Sportium services are available from a
total of 1,721 outlets, which is Spain’s largest bookmaker on the basis of gross win. A majority of the
outlets in Spain are locations where Sportium has acquired the right to provide its betting and gaming
services (for examples “bars” or “corners”), rather than being locations operated directly by Sportium or
a Sportium franchisee. A “bar” is simply a SSBT situated in a bar, and Sportium pays a commission to
the bar owners. A “corner” is an area within an arcade or other outlet where Sportium has SSBTs, in
addition to a manned counter that Sportium customers have access to. The arcades will be owned by a
third party and the person manning the counter may be an employee of the third party or a contractor
for Sportium. As at 25 October 2016, approximately 87 of the outlets at which Sportium services are
available operate under a franchise model, whereby Sportium enters into a franchise agreement with a
franchisee operator, who then establishes a betting office using Sportium’s retail licence, product and
systems infrastructure.

In 2015, Sportium launched in Castilla y Leon and the Canary Islands and now operates in fifteen
Spanish regions, having entered Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, La Rioja and Extremadura in 2014.
The Sportium retail joint venture produced an operating loss of £1.8 million (the Company’s share) for
the year ended 31 December 2015. For the half year ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), the Sportium
retail joint venture produced an operating loss of £0.2 million (the Company’s share).

**Core telephone betting**

Traditional telephone betting continues to decline as the Historic Ladbrokes Group actively migrates
customers to digital products and platforms. The telephone business had net revenues of £5.5 million
for the year ended 31 December 2015 and accounted for 0.5 per cent. of the Historic Ladbrokes
Group’s net revenue (excluding high rollers) for the year ended 31 December 2015. For the half year
ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), the telephone business had net revenues of £2.7 million and
accounted for 0.4 per cent. of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s net revenue (excluding high rollers).

-----

**High rollers**

The high rollers business provides a personalised telephone betting service for certain high net worth
individuals who have been invited to join the service based on their staking sizes and activity levels.
The high rollers business had net revenues of £4.0 million and accounted for 0.3 per cent. of the
Historic Ladbrokes Group’s net revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015. For the half year
ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), the high rollers business generated an operating loss of £0.1 million.

**3.** **Key strengths**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group believes that the following strengths will enable it to continue to compete
effectively and contribute to the Group’s achievement of its strategic objectives.

**Strong brand recognition in key markets**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group believes that its heritage and strong brand presence in the UK provide a
competitive advantage in an industry where attracting and maintaining customers is crucial to
developing the business.

Outside the UK, the Historic Ladbrokes Group has developed a reputation in some key markets as a
leading betting and gaming company. In Australia, Ladbrokes ranks second for brand awareness
among corporate bookmakers.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group believes that Ladbrokes’ brands provide a strong foundation for
protecting the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s market share in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Belgium,
growing the digital business and maximising the opportunities in Australia and Spain. The Historic
Ladbrokes Group believes that its brands are a key asset in retaining loyal customers and attracting
new ones. The Historic Ladbrokes Group is making significant investment in marketing activities to
build awareness and engages in market research to monitor performance.

**Leading and consistently cash generative UK retail business**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group is the second largest operator in the UK retail betting and gaming
market, based on number of LBOs, and at 25 October 2016 had 2,140 outlets in Great Britain.

For the years ended 31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015, the UK retail business produced net
revenues of £800.9 million, £811.5 million and £827.4 million, respectively, and profit before tax, net
finance expense and exceptional items of £133.9 million, £119.3 million and £116.1 million,
respectively. For the half year ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited), the UK retail business produced net
revenues of £436.6 million and profit before tax, net finance expense and exceptional items of £63.5
million.

**Significantly improved digital offer**

In recent years, the Historic Ladbrokes Group has invested in its digital products and platforms and
delivered improving customer metrics. Ladbrokes.com is delivering growth in recreational customer
numbers and amounts staked in its mobile and tablet services. This is a result of its transition in
December 2013 to the Playtech Mobenga platform along with its partnership with Chelsea Apps
Factory to deliver a more effective, innovative and competitive product. In July 2015, the Historic
Ladbrokes Group launched its new desktop product, powered by the Mobenga platform, which gives
customers a consistent experience with strong mobile and tablet offers. In addition, other
enhancements such as cash-out and single wallet were launched. As a result of the Historic Ladbrokes
Group’s improved customer offer and the benefits of the Company’s Israel’s CRM capabilities, gaming
net revenues for the half year ended 30 June 2016 (unaudited) increased by 26.8 per cent. from the
previous half year.

**Strongly growing Australian business**

Following the formation of Ladbrokes Australia in 2013 and the subsequent acquisitions of
bookmaker.com.au and betstar.com.au, Ladbrokes Australia’s financial performance and, in particular,

71


-----

revenue growth has been strong. Ladbrokes Australia has developed into a proven and effective
market challenger. As at 30 June 2015, it had a 7.3 per cent. market share (with an upward trend) and
was the third largest corporate bookmaker in Australia on the basis of revenue. The Group intends to
continue Ladbrokes Australia’s challenger strategy led by a strong pipeline of new and enhanced
products and effective marketing across all media.

-----

There are currently no environmental issues which will materially affect the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s
use of the assets described above or the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s use of its betting shop estate.

**7.** **Intellectual property**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s copyright, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, customer
databases and other intellectual property are important to its success. The Historic Ladbrokes Group
owns or has a licence to use the intellectual property rights in the key software used in its operations.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s registered UK and European Community trademarks which are
material to its business include “Ladbrokes”. These names are also either registered or pending in
appropriate worldwide jurisdictions. The Historic Ladbrokes Group has registered a portfolio of domain
names and takes active measures to protect its trademarks.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group uses a mixture of software under licence and internally developed
software for which it owns the copyright and retains rights of ownership. The Company relies on the
protection of trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, contractual protection and licence
agreements with its employees, customers and others to protect its proprietary rights.

**8.** **Risk management**

Risk management is highly important to all of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s operational businesses.

Trading risk is tightly controlled through a four-stage risk management process, which relies on: (i) the
compilation of odds by a team of expert odds compilers and bookmaking risk managers; (ii) access to
market information before odds are compiled and after odds are published; (iii) tightly controlled bet
acceptance limits under which the Historic Ladbrokes Group is under no obligation to accept any bet;
and (iv) effective hedging.

Unlike the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s bookmaking products, gaming machine and online gaming
products have a theoretical likelihood of success for the customer which is transparent. While it is
possible for the Historic Ladbrokes Group to incur losses in the short term, over time the margin reverts
to predetermined averages and hedging is not required.

There is also no trading risk on the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s pari-mutuel products. Poker income
generally comprises a percentage of the total pot in each game known as a ‘rake’.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group also has systems and controls in place which seek to ensure that the
Historic Ladbrokes Group does not accept bets or wagers via the internet from jurisdictions from which
it has determined that it does not wish to accept bets, whether because it is or may be unlawful to do
so and the Historic Ladbrokes Group has decided not to take any risk in such regard or for any other
reason. The systems and controls include monitoring and analysing information provided by potential
customers’ registered addresses and of customers’ payment methods.

**9.** **Information technology systems**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group operates a number of IT systems to support its various businesses. The
Historic Ladbrokes Group’s information technology is managed by in-house teams of IT personnel and
through partners such as Playtech, who host the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s online information
management system. Due to the importance of IT to its business, the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s
systems are hosted in secure data centres in Swindon, Rayners Lane and Gibraltar, with disaster
recovery facilities based in a further data centre in Leeds. All critical data is replicated in real-time.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group’s primary IT support requirements consist of betting risk management,
site hosting, games and sportsbetting delivery and management, payment processing, and customer
support. In order to ensure business continuity, the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s key systems have
appropriate redundancy and data replication across data centres. Fully documented and tested data
recovery and systems recovery plans are in place with business continuity strongly emphasised. These
arrangements are inspected and audited regularly.

**10.** **Marketing**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group enjoys strong brand recognition in its key markets and the Ladbrokes
brand is long-established, trusted and widely recognised. Since its launch in 2013, Ladbrokes Australia
has successfully pursued a challenger strategy and, as at May 2016, Ladbrokes ranks second for
brand awareness among corporate bookmakers in Australia. In recent years, the Historic Ladbrokes
Group has invested in its digital products and platforms to help ensure that the quality of the Historic
Ladbrokes Group’s digital offering matches its strong brand recognition.

The Historic Ladbrokes Group is currently increasing its marketing intensity as part of its strategy to
grow its recreational sportsbetting customer base. The Historic Ladbrokes Group has recently entered
into some high profile sponsorship agreements, including a title sponsorship deal with the Scottish
Professional Football League, an agreement with the Football Association to become its official betting
partner and FA Cup betting partner, title sponsorship deals with the Rugby Football League for the
Challenge Cup and Four Nations competitions and a title sponsorship deal with World Snooker for the
2016 World Grand Prix and Players Championships. In addition to this increased marketing intensity,
the Historic Ladbrokes Group has relaunched its advertising strategy by targeting media that
recreational customers use and making use of well-known ambassadors, such as Frankie Dettori,
Chris Kamara and Ally McCoist, to highlight its brand. Furthermore, the Historic Ladbrokes Group has
given more marketing capacity to Ladbrokes Israel to use its digital marketing expertise to help grow
the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s digital appeal.

**11.** **Supplier relationships**

The Historic Ladbrokes Group has a number of key suppliers who provide it with products and
services. The Historic Ladbrokes Group has a supplier relationship management programme under

**INFORMATION ON THE HISTORIC CORAL GROUP**

**1.** **The Historic Coral Group**

The Historic Coral Group can trace its origins to 1926 when Joe Coral started offering bets to
customers from a billiards club in Stoke Newington.

The Historic Coral Group is now one of Europe’s largest betting and gaming groups based on annual
gross win, with an established presence in the UK and Italy, the two largest regulated betting and
gaming markets in Europe. The Historic Coral Group comprises three main trading divisions: Coral
Retail, Eurobet Retail and Online. The Historic Coral Group operates Telebet, a telephone betting
business which is part of Online and a central support division.

**(a)** **Coral Retail**

Coral Retail is the third largest operator in the retail market in the UK where it directly owns and
operates 1,806 LBOs under the ‘Coral’ brand as at 25 October 2016, with an estimated market share,
of approximately 20.8 per cent. as at 31 March 2016 based on number of LBOs. LBOs operated by
Coral Retail offer both OTC betting and gaming machines. The OTC betting services of Coral Retail
offer customers a wide range of betting opportunities, including all mainstream domestic and
international sporting events, such as football, horse and greyhound racing, golf, rugby and cricket.
The gaming machines operated by Coral Retail are FOBTs, which offer a variety of simulated slot
machine games, roulette, blackjack and quiz games to customers.

Coral Retail’s LBOs typically consist of a high street storefront which contains one or more OTC betting
positions where customers place their bets and settle their winnings, television screens and seating to
follow live sporting events, and up to four FOBTs. The standard opening hours for Coral Retail’s LBOs
are from 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.

Coral Retail advertises its LBOs through print media, online and other channels such as sponsorship of
sporting events. Its promotions include offering free bets, enhanced odds, limited-time offerings of
certain gaming machine games and customer loyalty promotions.

Coral Retail also operates two greyhound stadia, in Hove and Romford, which allows the Historic Coral
Group direct access to greyhound racing content.

Coral Retail’s LBOs accept bets on a wide variety of sporting events. Football and horse and
greyhound racing make up the largest part of OTC betting operations.

Coral Retail’s LBOs also accept bets on non-sporting events, such as the outcomes of elections,
national talent contests and reality television programmes. Numbers betting, which involves betting on
various games based on a random number generator, and betting on foreign and in-house lotteries
also make up part of Coral Retail’s OTC betting business.

**(b)** **Eurobet Retail**

Eurobet Retail was created in 2006 and opened its first shop in June 2007. It is now number three in
the market for OTC betting in Italy based on annual gross win, which is primarily generated from
football betting operations, with a smaller share in the horse race betting market. Eurobet Retail
operates in the Italian retail market under the ‘Eurobet’ brand through LBOs run on a franchise
model. Under that model, franchisees provide the premises and incur the running costs, and Eurobet
Retail provides the product, trading and brand marketing. Franchisees receive a share of the retail net
revenue they generate, plus a commission for the online activity of customers they recruit.

Retail betting licences in Italy are supply-constrained. The last auction for Italian licences took place in
2013, when Eurobet won 500 new licences, which comprised 25 per cent. of those made available in
the auction. Following the roll-out of these shops and as at 2 July 2016, Eurobet operated 834
licences, generated over €450 million in annual gross win and had a 15.7 per cent. share (by turnover)
of the Italian retail sports betting market.

75


-----

The Group understands that ADM, the Italian betting and gaming regulator, is currently in the process
of preparing for the next auction of Italian licences. The current licences held by Eurobet Retail, which
govern its Italian sports and horserace betting operations, were due to expire in June 2016, but ADM
has permitted existing operators, such as Eurobet Retail, to continue operating under their current
licences in exchange for them extending the expiry date of their guarantees to ADM. The new tender
documentation for Italian sports and horserace betting licences is expected to be issued by ADM
towards the end of 2016 or early 2017, with the completion of the process and assignment of the new
licences likely to take place in early 2017.

**(c)** **Online**

The Historic Coral Group operates Coral UK Online, Eurobet Online and Telebet.

**Coral UK Online**

Coral UK Online was completely relaunched in 2012. This involved a relocation to Gibraltar, a
substantial replacement of the management team and the development of a brand new technology
architecture. The Historic Coral Group operates in the UK through three key brands: ‘Coral’, ‘Gala
Bingo’ and ‘Gala Casino’. The back office operations are fully integrated, with each brand being
marketed to different customer segments. Coral UK Online is the sixth largest operation in the UK
market with an 8.1 per cent. market share as at 31 December 2015.

_www.coral.co.uk_

www.coral.co.uk has demonstrated strong growth since its relaunch in autumn 2012. Customers can
place bets on the outcome of various sporting events, including in play betting or play online slots or
casino games. The multi-channel offering ‘Coral Connect’ allows customers to access a single wallet
across all platforms as well as the ability to deposit and withdraw funds in shops directly from the
online wallet.

_www.galabingo.com_

www.galabingo.com is the second largest player in the online bingo market in the UK. Customers can
participate in scheduled bingo sessions or play slots games and roulette (including live roulette). While
bingo is the driver of visits, a substantial proportion of turnover is generated from online games.

_www.galacasino.com_

www.galacasino.com offers a full range of casino and live casino products including a full suite of
proprietary and third party online games.

**Eurobet Online business**

Eurobet Online operates through the website www.Eurobet.it and is available to Italian residents. It
delivers a full range of sports betting, casino and games products, including virtual racing and bet-inplay products.

The operation is based in Rome, alongside its retail counterpart, with secure servers also hosted in
Rome.

Eurobet Online runs its own in-house software platform for sports betting and casino games, which
also integrates with software providers for poker, bingo, casino and virtual racing products.

Eurobet Online is the number two online sports operator in Italy, with its growth underpinned by multichannel acquisitions through the retail estate.

**(d)** **Telebet**

Telebet is the Historic Coral Group’s telephone-based betting operation. It is based in Barking, UK
alongside the Coral UK Online business customer service operation. It is open seven days per week
between 8:30 a.m. and 10:45 p.m.

**2.** **Sources of revenue**

For the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2015, the Historic Coral Group generated revenue and EBITDA
of £1,006.6 million and £204.0 million, respectively, and a total EBITDA margin of 20.3 per cent. For
the same period, 88.7 per cent. of the Historic Coral Group’s revenue was generated from customers
in the UK, with the remainder generated primarily from customers in Italy.

The following chart sets out key information for each of the Historic Coral Group’s businesses for the
40 weeks ended 2 July 2016.

**Division** **Coral Retail** **Eurobet Retail** **Online**

% Revenue 63.0 8.8 27.9

% EBITDA 61.0 9.4 32.2

% Gross Win 58.2 8.0 33.5

**3.** **Key strengths**

The Historic Coral Group believes that the following strengths will enable it to continue to compete
effectively and contribute to the Group’s achievement of its strategic objectives:

    - dynamic technology platforms;

    - multi-channel capability;

    - innovative and exclusive content; and

    - use of business intelligence.

**(a)** **Dynamic technology platforms**

The Historic Coral Group’s technology uses the best of in-house software and third party providers
often with ring-fenced development teams. The Historic Coral Group’s technology platform was fully
rebuilt in 2011-12, and was relaunched in the second half of 2012. This was the first fully integrated
use of Playtech’s Information Management System as a single wallet and enabled the Historic Coral
Group to manage customers across all sports and gaming products. The ‘Coral Connect’ card was
launched in March 2014 and was the first multi-channel offering in the UK retail betting and gaming
market.

The Historic Coral Group also operates a single proprietary native app, delivering a full range of
products to a customer with a single download and removing the need for multiple log-ins as a
customer moves between betting and gaming products.

Eurobet’s technology platform is integrated across online, mobile and retail, with multi-channel
functionality including a single wallet.

**(b)** **Multi-channel capability**

The ‘Coral Connect’ card was launched in March 2014 and was the first seamless multi-channel
offering in the UK retail betting and gaming market. Coral Connect allows a shared wallet to be used
across online and retail, which delivers greater convenience to customers, permits easy player
supervision and allows targeted incentives to further responsible play.

Coral Connect customers are around double the value online of non-Coral Connect customers and the
ability to deposit and withdraw funds in shop directly from the online wallet has proved very
popular. This facility is a key differentiator for www.coral.co.uk and is a major contributor to the
significantly lower churn rates of Coral Connect customers.

**(c)** **Innovative and exclusive content**

The Historic Coral Group believes that innovation is critical to maintaining and growing market share in
a highly competitive market and the Historic Coral Group has launched a number of new products in
recent years including the Football Jackpot, the Health Lottery, enhanced numbers products and
scratch cards.

77


-----

The online betting market has been characterised by a greater degree of innovation in recent years
with all major operators, including the Historic Coral Group, now providing “cash out” or “partial cash
out” facilities, better visualisations, better scoreboards and many more live streamed events.

Exclusive gaming content generated by the Historic Coral Group’s in-house development team has
proven to be profitable and sustainable with a strong pipeline to develop further new internal and multichannel games.

**(d)** **Use of business intelligence**

The UK online operation includes highly developed data capture architecture, with all player activity
being collated in a strategic data warehouse in Gibraltar. The Historic Coral Group is able to target
campaigns on the basis of this data, through dedicated teams in Gibraltar and Israel. The strong
capabilities in business intelligence drives decision making across the business such as using lifetime
value and churn modelling, which has enabled the Historic Coral Group to optimise acquisition spend
and effective intervention to prevent churn.

The Historic Coral Group’s ultimate goal is to interact with all customers on a one-to-one basis,
providing each customer with a unique experience tailored to their own preferences, and recent betting
and gaming patterns.

**4.** **Current trading and prospects**

The period post 2 July 2016 represents the 15 week period to 16 October 2016 incorporating the
12 week period to 25 September 2016 (fourth quarter of the financial year ended 25 September 2016)
and the subsequent 3 week period to 16 October 2016.

**12 week period to 25 September 2016 (fourth quarter of 2016 financial year):**

Trading in the 12 week period to 25 September (further quarter of 2016 financial year was positive with
Coral Group net revenue 8.9 per cent. ahead of last year (year to date +11.3 per cent.).

Coral Retail total net revenue grew 0.3 per cent, driven by an improvement in OTC gross win margin
and machines growth.

Eurobet Retail net revenue was 31.2 per cent. ahead of last year, with strong growth in sports stakes.

Online saw continued strong growth with net revenue 23.7 per cent. ahead of last year (year to date
+28.3 per cent.) with Coral.co.uk net revenue 31.7 per cent. ahead driven by strong sports stakes
growth.

**3 week period to 16 October 2016**

The Historic Coral Group’s net revenue was ahead of last year, with growth in all divisions except Coral
Retail which was marginally behind.

Trading for the period from 16 October 2016 to the date of the Merger Prospectus has been in and is in
line with the expectations of the Historic Coral Group and there has been no material change to the
financial position of the Historic Coral Group since that date.

**5.** **Principal investments**

The Historic Coral Group does not have any principal investments other than its significant
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned by GC Group (Jersey) Limited.

**6.** **Property, plant and equipment**

The Historic Coral Group leases its principal executive office, which is located in central London. Coral
Retail is located in Stratford, London. Eurobet is based in the Historic Coral Group’s offices in Rome,
Italy. Online is managed in Gibraltar, and the division has a customer support centre in Woking, UK
and a centre for customer analytics in Tel Aviv, Israel. The Historic Coral Group’s Telebet operations
are based in Barking, UK.

78


-----

In addition to the Historic Coral Group’s executive and other administrative offices, as at 25 October
2016, the Historic Coral Group operated approximately 1,806 LBOs and 2 greyhound stadia. Of the
Historic Coral Group’s 1,818 property interests (excluding non-operational properties) as at 25 October
2016, 1,812 were leasehold and 6 freehold. The Eurobet Retail business operates through franchised
‘shops’ and ‘corners’ which are owned or leased by franchisees who incur the running costs associated
with such premises.

Details of the principal properties of the Historic Coral Group are set out below:

There are currently no environmental issues which will materially affect the Historic Coral Group’s use
of the assets described above or the Historic Coral Group’s use of its betting shop estate.

**7.** **Intellectual property**

The Historic Coral Group has a number of brands, logos, websites and other intellectual property that it
seeks to protect from third party infringement through the registration of trademarks, domain names in
the UK and other jurisdictions and through certain other means of trade secret protection, licences,
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, as well as through other contractual provisions.

The Historic Coral Group has trademarks registered over its core brands, as well as each of its
divisional brands, including Coral and Eurobet, and certain of its online brands, including
www.coral.co.uk, www.galacasino.com and www.galabingo.com. Like the ‘Coral’ and ‘Eurobet’ brands,
the ‘Gala’ brand is owned by the Historic Coral Group though it and other bingo trademarks are
licensed to Caledonia Investments, the operator of the bingo retail business, under a trademark licence
agreement.

**8.** **Risk management**

Risk management is highly important to all of the Historic Coral Group’s operational businesses.

Trading risk is tightly controlled through a four-stage risk management process which relies on: (i) the
compilation of odds by a team of expert odds compilers and bookmaking risk managers; (ii) access to
market information before odds are compiled and after odds are published; (iii) tightly controlled bet
acceptance limits under which the Historic Coral Group is under no obligation to accept any bet; and
(iv) effective hedging.

Unlike the Historic Coral Group’s bookmaking products, gaming machine and online gaming products
have a theoretical likelihood of success for the customer which is transparent. While it is possible for
the Historic Coral Group to incur losses in the short term, over time the margin reverts to
predetermined averages and hedging is not required.

There is also no trading risk on the Historic Coral Group’s pari-mutuel products. Poker income
generally comprises a percentage of the total pot in each game known as a ‘rake’. Similarly, the
Historic Coral Group’s bingo income is derived from a fee charged to participants.

The Historic Coral Group also has systems and controls in place which seek to ensure that the Historic
Coral Group does not accept bets or wagers via the internet from jurisdictions from which it has
determined that it does not wish to accept bets, whether because it is or may be unlawful to do so and
the Historic Coral Group has decided not to take any risk in such regard or for any other reason. The
systems and controls include monitoring and analysing information provided by potential customers’
registered addresses and of customers’ payment methods.

79


-----

**9.** **Information technology systems**

The Historic Coral Group operates a number of IT systems to support its various businesses. The
Historic Coral Group’s information technology is managed by in-house teams of IT personnel and
through partners such as Playtech, who host the Historic Coral Group’s online information
management system. Due to the importance of IT to its business, the Historic Coral Group’s systems
are hosted in modern, secure data centres in Gibraltar and Woking. As part of its technology diversity
and ongoing in-house development strategy, the Historic Coral Group also leverages cloud based
services from Tier1 providers such as Google to help deliver the front end experience to customers. All
critical data is replicated in real-time between the Historic Coral Group’s data centres for back-up
purposes and data held with key suppliers is also backed up within the Historic Coral Group’s own IT
systems.

The Historic Coral Group’s primary IT support requirements consist of betting risk management, site
hosting, games and sportsbetting delivery and management, payment processing and customer
support. In order to ensure business continuity, the Historic Coral Group’s key systems have
appropriate redundancy and data replication across data centres and enterprise grade, high availability
systems within the data centre. Fully documented and tested data recovery and systems recovery
plans are in place with business continuity strongly emphasised. These arrangements are inspected
and audited regularly.

**10.** **Supplier relationships**

The Historic Coral Group has contractual arrangements with third parties for the supply of certain of the
large variety of products and services it uses in its businesses. The most significant of these
arrangements are for the supply of Playtech’s systems to Online, the supply of video and audio content
for LBOs operated by Coral Retail, the supply of FOBTs and related games and other content for LBOs
operated by Coral Retail, and the supply of other software platforms to Online.

From time-to-time, in a number of cases, the Historic Coral Group has elected to use a single supplier
for all of or a substantial proportion of a specific category of products or services utilised by one or
more of its businesses. The Board believes that, in virtually all cases, these suppliers can be replaced,
but replacement may result in incurring costs and experiencing disruptions.

**11.** **Marketing**

The Historic Coral Group advertises its LBOs through print media, online, and through other channels,
such as sponsorship of sporting events. The Historic Coral Group’s promotions include offering free
bets, enhanced odds, limited-time offerings of certain FOBT games and customer loyalty promotions.

The Historic Coral Group undertakes both online and offline marketing to promote its brand and
products to customers. Offline marketing typically involves print, event and radio advertising. Online
marketing involves a number of internet-based marketing tools, including natural and paid search, TV,
press and event advertising and promotions. The marketing investment made by Online increased by
35 per cent. in the first three quarters of the 2016 financial year to £59.2 million, which equates to
24 per cent. of Online’s net revenue.

of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Debt or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant;
provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in Consolidated Interest
Expense of the Guarantor as accrued. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
covenant, the maximum amount of Debt that the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of it may
incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) the accreted value of the Debt, in the case of any Debt issued with original
issue discount;

(b) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by Security on the assets of the
specified Person, the lesser of:

(1) the fair market value of such asset at the date of determination; and

(2) the amount of the Debt of the other Person;

(c) the greater of the liquidation preference or the maximum fixed redemption or
repurchase price of the Disqualified Stock, in the case of Disqualified Stock;
and

(d) the principal amount of the Debt, in the case of any other Debt.

For the purposes of the foregoing, the “maximum fixed redemption or repurchase price” of
any Disqualified Stock that does not have a fixed redemption or repurchase price shall be
calculated in accordance with the terms of such Disqualified Stock as if such Disqualified
Stock were redeemed or repurchased on any date of determination.

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, the Sterling Equivalent of
the principal amount of Debt denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Debt was Incurred, in the
case of term Debt, or first drawn, in the case of Debt Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; provided that (a) if such Debt is Incurred to refinance other Debt denominated in a

93


-----

currency other than Sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Sterlingdenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Sterling-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing
Debt does not exceed the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced, (b) the Sterling
Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Debt outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date, and
(c) if any such Debt is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect
to the currency in which such Debt is denominated covering principal, premium, if any, and
interest on such Debt, the amount of such Debt and such interest and premium, if any,
shall be determined after giving effect to all payments in respect thereof under such
Currency Exchange Protection Agreements.

The principal amount of any Debt Incurred to refinance other Debt, if Incurred in a different
currency from the Debt being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Debt is denominated
that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, there shall be no double
counting of any Debt.

(B) Covenant Suspension

If, on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have an Investment Grade rating from at
least two of the Rating Agencies and no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as
defined in the Trust Deed) has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to
have an Investment Grade rating from at least two of the Rating Agencies, the covenant
contained in Condition 3.2(A) (Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) will not apply.

However, such covenant will be reinstituted and apply according to its terms as of and from
the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenant will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Guarantor or the Issuer properly
taken in compliance with the provisions of the Trust Deed during the continuance of the
Suspension Event and no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default will be deemed to
have occurred solely by reason of any Incurrence of Debt during that period. In addition, for
the purpose of the covenant contained in Condition 3.2(A) (Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio),
all Debt Incurred (or contractually committed to be Incurred pursuant to the paragraph
below) during the continuance of the Suspension Event shall be deemed Incurred pursuant
to subparagraph 3.2(A)(iii) above.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer is entitled to honour any contractual commitment in
the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade rating
from at least two of the Rating Agencies, without it causing an Event of Default or Potential
Event of Default, as long as the contractual commitments were entered into in good faith
during the continuance of the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no
longer having an Investment Grade rating.

**3.3** **Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Substantially All Assets**

The Guarantor shall not consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into (whether or not the
Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign or convey, transfer, lease, or otherwise
dispose of, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets
(determined on a consolidated basis for it and its Subsidiaries) to, another Person, unless:

(A) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person, if other than the Guarantor (the “Successor”),
shall be a Person organised and existing under the laws of England and Wales, Australia,
any member state of the European Union as of 1 January 2004, or any State of the United
States and shall expressly assume, by a supplement to the Trust Deed, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the
Guarantor in respect of the Notes and under the Trust Deed;

(B) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (and treating any
Debt which becomes an obligation of the Guarantor or the Successor, as applicable, or any

94


-----

Subsidiary of the Guarantor or the Successor, as the case may be, as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Guarantor or the Successor or such Subsidiary
at the time of such transaction) no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing;

(C) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, as if such
transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Measurement Period (and
treating any Debt which becomes an obligation of the Guarantor or the Successor, as
applicable, or any Subsidiary of the Guarantor or the Successor, as the case may be, as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Guarantor or the Successor or
such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), either:

(i) the Guarantor or, as the case may be, the Successor could Incur at least £1 of
additional Debt pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant in Condition 3.2(A)
(Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) (subject to any suspension pursuant to Condition
3.2(B) (Covenant Suspension)); or

(ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Guarantor or, as the case may be, the
Successor and its Subsidiaries would be greater than or equal to such ratio for the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and

(D) the Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee (i) a certificate signed by two Authorised
Signatories of the Guarantor stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition and such supplement to the
Trust Deed (if any) comply with the provisions of this covenant and (ii) an opinion(s) of
independent legal advisers of recognised standing as to all relevant laws in a form(s)
satisfactory to the Trustee and opining as to the matters referred to in (A) above and
provided that in giving an opinion, legal counsel may rely on the certificate in (i) as to any
matter of fact.

The Successor shall succeed to, and be substituted for and may exercise every right and power
of, the Guarantor under the Trust Deed. Except in the case of a lease, the Guarantor shall be
relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Trust Deed and the Notes.

Nothing contained in the foregoing restrictions on merger, consolidation, amalgamation and
asset transfers shall prohibit:

(A) any Subsidiary of the Guarantor from consolidating or amalgamating with, merging with or
into, or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Guarantor or another
Subsidiary of the Guarantor provided that, after giving effect to any such merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or asset transfer, no Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom; or

(B) the merger, consolidation or other combination of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries with or into another person for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of
that Person, reincorporating (or other similar transaction) the Issuer, Guarantor or, as the
case may be, any of its Subsidiaries, in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of
the Issuer, Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.

**3.4** **Trustee not obliged to monitor**

The Trustee shall be under no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer or the Guarantor
with any of the covenants, restrictions or provisions set out in this Condition 3 (Covenants) and
shall have no liability to any person as a result of any failure to monitor such compliance.

**4.** **Interest**

**4.1** **Interest Rate and Interest Payment Dates**

The Notes bear interest from and including [Š] (the “Issue Date”) at the rate of [Š] percent, per
annum (the “Rate of Interest”), payable semi-annually in arrear on [Š] and [Š] in each year (each
an “Interest Payment Date” and the period from (and including) an Interest Payment Date (or
the Issue Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first) Interest Payment Date an “Interest Period”).
The first Interest Payment Date will be [Š]. The amount of interest in respect of each semi-annual

95


-----

period will amount to £[Š] per £1,000 in principal amount of the Notes. The number of days in any
Interest Period will be deemed to be the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by
365.

**4.2** **Interest Accrual**

Each Note will cease to bear interest from and including its due date for redemption unless, upon
due presentation, payment of the principal in respect of the Note is improperly withheld or
refused or unless default is otherwise made in respect of payment, in which event interest shall
continue to accrue as provided in the Trust Deed.

**4.3** **Calculation of Broken Interest**

When interest is required to be calculated in respect of a period of less than a full half-year, it
shall be calculated by (i) applying the Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount, (ii) multiplying
such amount by (a) the actual number of days in the period from and including the date from
which interest begins to accrue to but excluding the date on which it falls due (such period, the
“Accrual Period”) divided by (b) the product of (1) the number of days in the Determination
Period in which the Accrual Period falls (“Determination Period” means the period from and
including the earlier of the [Š] or [Š] (as the case may be) preceding the date on which such
interest falls due to but excluding the earlier of the next following [Š] or [Š] (as the case may be))
and (2) two and (iii) rounding the resultant figure to the nearest pence, half of any pence being
rounded upwards. In the case of any such period, the amount of interest payable in respect of a
Note shall be the product of the amount (determined in the manner provided above) per
Calculation Amount and the amount by which the Calculation Amount is multiplied to reach the
denomination of such Note, without any further rounding.

**5.** **Payments**

**5.1** **Payments in respect of Notes**

Payments of principal and interest in respect of each Note will be made against presentation and
surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the Note, except that payments
of interest due on an Interest Payment Date will be made against presentation and surrender (or,
in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the relevant Coupon, in each case at the
specified office of any of the Paying Agents.

**5.2** **Method of Payment**

Payments will be made by credit or transfer to an account in pounds sterling maintained by the
payee with or, at the option of the payee, by a cheque in pounds sterling drawn on, a bank in
London.

**5.3** **Missing Unmatured Coupons**

Each Note should be presented for payment together with all relative unmatured Coupons, failing
which the full amount of any relative missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not
being made in full, that proportion of the full amount of the missing unmatured Coupon which the
amount so paid bears to the total amount due) will be deducted from the amount due for
payment. Each amount so deducted will be paid in the manner mentioned above against
presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the relative
missing Coupon at any time before the expiry of 10 years after the Relevant Date in respect of
the relevant Note (whether or not the Coupon would otherwise have become void pursuant to
Condition 8 (Prescription)) or, if later, five years after the date on which the Coupon would have
become due, but not thereafter.

**5.4** **Payments subject to applicable laws**

Payments in respect of principal and interest on the Notes are subject in all cases to any fiscal or
other laws and regulations applicable in the place of payment, but without prejudice to the
provisions of Condition 7 (Taxation).

96


-----

**5.5** **Payment only on a Presentation Date**

A holder shall be entitled to present a Note or Coupon for payment only on a Presentation Date
and shall not, except as provided in Condition 4 (Interest), be entitled to any further interest or
other payment if a Presentation Date is after the due date.

**5.6** **Initial Paying Agents**

The name of the initial Paying Agent and its initial specified office is set out at the end of these
Conditions. The Issuer and the Guarantor reserve the right, subject to the prior written approval
of the Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent and to
appoint additional or other Paying Agents provided that:

(A) there will at all times be a Principal Paying Agent; and

(B) so long as the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or admitted to listing by any other
relevant authority, there will at all times be a Paying Agent with a specified office in such
place as may be required by the rules and regulations of the relevant stock exchange or
such other relevant authority.

Notice of any termination or appointment and of any changes in specified offices will be given to
the Noteholders promptly by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices).

In acting under the Agency Agreement, the Paying Agents act solely as agents of the Issuer and
the Guarantor and, in certain limited circumstances specified therein, of the Trustee and do not
assume any obligation to, or relationship of agency or trust with, the Noteholders or the
Couponholders. The Agency Agreement contains provisions permitting any entity into which any
Paying Agent is merged or converted or with which it is consolidated or to which it transfers all or
substantially all of its assets to become the successor paying agent.

**5.7** **FATCA**

Payments will be subject in all cases to (i) any fiscal or other laws and regulations applicable
thereto in the place of payment, but without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 7 (Taxation)
and (ii) any withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in Section
1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant
to Sections 1471 through to 1474 of the Code, any regulations or agreements thereunder, any
official interpretations thereof, or (without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 7 (Taxation))
any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto.

**6.** **Redemption and Purchase**

**6.1** **Redemption at Maturity**

Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled as provided below, the Issuer will
redeem the Notes at their principal amount on [Š].

**6.2** **Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

If the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately before the giving of the notice referred to below
that:

(A) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of a Relevant
Jurisdiction, or any change in the application or official interpretation of the laws or
regulations of a Relevant Jurisdiction, which change or amendment becomes effective after

[Š], on the next Interest Payment Date either (i) the Issuer would be required to pay
additional amounts as provided or referred to in Condition 7 (Taxation) or (ii) the Guarantor
would be unable for reasons outside its control to procure payment by the Issuer and in
making payment itself would be required to pay such additional amounts; and

(B) the requirement cannot be avoided by the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor
taking reasonable measures available to it,

97


-----

the Issuer may at its option, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices), redeem all the Notes, but not some only,
at any time at their principal amount together with interest accrued to but excluding the date of
redemption provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior
to the earliest date on which the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor would be required
to pay such additional amounts, were a payment in respect of the Notes then due. Prior to the
publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the
Trustee a certificate signed by two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer or, as the case may be,
the Guarantor stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem
have occurred, and an opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect
that the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor has or will become obliged to pay such
additional amounts as a result of such change or amendment and the Trustee shall be entitled to
accept such certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set out above in which event they shall be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders
and the Couponholders.

**6.3** **Redemption of Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Put Event occurs, unless notice of redemption of all of the Notes has previously been given
pursuant to Condition 6.2 (Redemption for Taxation Reasons), each Noteholder shall have the
option to require the Issuer to redeem or purchase the Notes of such holder at a cash purchase
price equal to 101 per cent. of the principal amount thereof together with interest accrued to but
excluding the date of redemption or purchase, as the case may be. Such option shall operate as
set out below.

As soon as practicable after the occurrence of a Put Event and in any case not later than 30 days
thereafter, the Issuer shall, and at any time upon the Trustee becoming aware that a Put Event
has occurred the Trustee may, and if so requested by the holders of at least one-quarter in
nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding or if so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of
the Noteholders, shall (subject in each case to being indemnified and/or secured and/or
prefunded to its satisfaction), give a notice (the “Change of Control Notice”) to the Trustee (in
the case of a notice from the Issuer) and the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12
(Notices) stating:

(A) that a Put Event has occurred and that each Noteholder is entitled to require the Issuer to
redeem or purchase the Notes of such holder pursuant to this Condition 6.3 (Redemption
_of Notes upon a Change of Control);_

(B) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Put Event;

(C) the redemption or purchase price and the redemption or purchase date (which shall be no
earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is given); and

(D) the procedures for exercising the option in this Condition 6.3 (Redemption of Notes upon a
_Change of Control)._

To exercise the option to require the redemption or purchase of a Note under this Condition 6.3
(Redemption of Notes upon a Change of Control), the holder of the Note must deliver such Note
at the specified office of a Paying Agent at any time during normal business hours of such Paying
Agent falling within the period (the “Put Period”) of 45 days after the Change of Control Notice is
given, accompanied by a duly signed and completed notice of exercise in the form (for the time
being current) obtainable from the specified office of each Paying Agent (a “Change of Control
**Put Notice”). The Note should be delivered together with all Coupons appertaining thereto**
maturing after the date which is 7 days after the expiration of the Put Period (the “Put Date”),
failing which the relevant Paying Agent will require payment of an amount equal to the face value
of any missing such Coupon. Any amount so paid will be reimbursed in the manner provided in
Condition 5.3 (Missing Unmatured Coupons) against presentation and surrender of the relevant
missing Coupon (or any replacement therefore issued pursuant to Condition 11 (Replacement of
_Notes and Coupons)) at any time after such payment, but before the expiry of the period of five_
years from the Relevant Date in respect of that Coupon. The relevant Paying Agent will issue to
the Noteholder concerned a non-transferable receipt in respect of the Note so delivered.
Payment in respect of any Note so delivered will be made, if the holder duly specified a bank
account in the Change of Control Put Notice to which payment is to be made on the Put Date by

98


-----

transfer to that bank account and, in every other case, on or after the Put Date against
presentation and surrender or (as the case may be) endorsement of such receipt at the specified
office of a Paying Agent. A Change of Control Put Notice, once given shall be irrevocable. For
the purposes of these Conditions, receipts issued pursuant to this Condition shall be treated as if
they were Notes. The Issuer shall redeem or purchase the relevant Notes on the Put Date unless
previously redeemed and cancelled or purchased.

The Trustee is under no obligation to ascertain whether a Put Event or any event which could
lead to the occurrence of or could constitute a Put Event has occurred and, until it shall have
actual knowledge or notice pursuant to the Trust Deed to the contrary, the Trustee may assume
that no Put Event or other such event has occurred.

A “Put Event” will occur if, while any of the Notes remains outstanding:

(i) a Change of Control occurs; and

(ii) either (a) the Notes do not have an Investment Grade rating from at least two of the
Rating Agencies at the time the Change of Control occurs, or (b) the Notes do have
an Investment Grade rating from at least two of the Rating Agencies (and if there are
more than two such ratings, the Issuer shall be entitled to determine which two
Rating Agencies shall be relevant for the purposes of this provision) at the time the
Change of Control occurs but at any time during the Change of Control Period either
such Rating Agency rates the Notes as non-Investment Grade and such rating is not
within the Change of Control Period restored to an Investment Grade rating by such
Rating Agency or replaced by an Investment Grade rating of another Rating Agency,
or any such Rating Agency withdraws its rating of the Notes and the rating of such
Rating Agency is not within the Change of Control Period replaced by an Investment
Grade rating of another Rating Agency; and in each case such Rating Agency
announces or publicly confirms or informs the Trustee in writing that such nonInvestment Grade rating or withdrawal of rating was the result, in whole or in part, of
any event or circumstance comprised in or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the
applicable Change of Control (whether or not the Change of Control shall have
occurred at the time such rating is given or rating is withdrawn).

**6.4** **Redemption at the Option of the Issuer**

(A) The Issuer may, having given not less than 15 nor more than 30 days’ notice to the
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12.1 (Notices to the Noteholders), the Trustee
and the Principal Paying Agent (which notices shall specify the date fixed for redemption),
redeem all of the Notes or, subject as provided in Condition 6.5 (Provisions relating to
_Partial Redemption) below, from time to time some of the Notes only, at any time at such_
amount as is equal to the greater of the following together with interest accrued to but
excluding the date of redemption:

(i) the principal amount outstanding of the Notes; and

(ii) the price, expressed as a percentage (as reported in writing to the Issuer and the
Trustee by a financial adviser appointed by the Issuer and approved by the Trustee),
at which the Gross Redemption Yield on the Notes (if the Notes were to remain
outstanding to their original maturity) on the Calculation Date is equal to (x) the Gross
Redemption Yield at 3.00 p.m. (London time) on that date of the [Š] per cent.
Treasury Stock due [Š] (or, where such financial adviser advises the Issuer and the
Trustee that, for reasons of illiquidity or otherwise, such stock is not appropriate for
such purpose, such other government stock as such financial adviser may
recommend) plus (y) 0.50 per cent.

For such purposes, “Calculation Date” means the date which is the second business day
in London prior to the date of redemption and “Gross Redemption Yield” means a yield
calculated on the basis set out by the United Kingdom Debt Management Office in the
paper “Formulae for Calculating Gilt Prices from Yields” page 5, Section One: Price/Yield
Formulae “Conventional Gilts”; Double-dated and Undated Gilts and Assumed (or Actual)
Redemption on a Quasi-Coupon Date” (published 8 June 1998 and subsequently updated
on 15 January 2002 and 16 March 2005 and as further updated or amended from time to
time). For the purposes of the above calculation, “business day in London” means a day

99


-----

on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open
for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits)
in London.

_(B)_ The Issuer may, having given not less than 15 nor more than 30 days’ notice to the
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12.1 (Notices to the Noteholders), the Trustee
and the Principal Paying Agent (which notices shall specify the Issuer Maturity Par Call
Redemption Date as the date fixed for redemption), redeem all of the Notes, but not some
only, on the Issuer Maturity Par Call Redemption Date in an amount equal to the principal
amount outstanding of the Notes plus accrued interest (if any) at the Issuer Maturity Par
Call Redemption Date.

**6.5** **Provisions relating to Partial Redemption**

In the case of a partial redemption of Notes, Notes to be redeemed will be selected, in such
place as the Trustee may approve and in such manner as the Trustee may deem appropriate
and fair, not more than 30 days before the date fixed for redemption, notice of any such selection
will be given not less than 15 days before the date fixed for redemption. Each notice will specify
the date fixed for redemption and the aggregate principal amount (including accrued interest) of
the Notes to be redeemed, the serial numbers of the Notes called for redemption, the serial
numbers of Notes previously called for redemption and not presented for payment and the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes which will be outstanding after the partial redemption.

**6.6** **Purchases**

The Issuer, the Guarantor or any of the Guarantor’s other Subsidiaries may at any time purchase
Notes (provided that all unmatured Coupons appertaining to the Notes are purchased with the
Notes) in any manner and at any price. Such Notes may be held, reissued, resold or, at the
option of the Issuer, surrendered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation.

**6.7** **Cancellations**

All Notes which are purchased pursuant to Condition 6.3 (Redemption of Notes upon a Change
_of Control) or redeemed will forthwith be cancelled (together with all unmatured Coupons_
attached to the Notes or surrendered therewith at the time of redemption). All Notes so cancelled
and any Notes purchased and cancelled pursuant to Condition 6.6 (Purchases) above (together
with all unmatured Coupons cancelled therewith) shall be forwarded to the Principal Paying
Agent for cancellation and cannot be reissued or resold.

**6.8** **Notices**

(A) Notice of any redemption in relation to Condition 6.4 (Redemption at the Option of the
_Issuer) or Condition 6.5 (Provisions relating to Partial Redemption) above, may state that_
such notice is conditional upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in
which case such notice will be revoked by the Issuer (by written notice to the Trustee prior
to the specified date for redemption) if such condition is not satisfied.

(B) Subject to Condition 6.8(A) above, upon the expiry of any notice as is referred to in
Condition 6.2 (Redemption for Taxation Reasons), 6.3 (Redemption of Notes upon a
_Change of Control), 6.4 (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer), 6.5 (Provisions relating to_
_Partial Redemption) or 6.6 (Purchases) above, the Issuer shall be bound to redeem or_
purchase, as the case may be, the Notes to which the notice refers in accordance with the
terms of such Condition.

**7.** **Taxation**

**7.1** **Payment without Withholding**

All payments in respect of the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantor shall be made
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (“Taxes”) imposed or levied by or on
behalf of the Relevant Jurisdiction, unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required
by law. In that event, the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor will pay such additional
amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Noteholders and
Couponholders after the withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts which

100


-----

would have been receivable in respect of the Notes or, as the case may be, Coupons in the
absence of the withholding or deduction; except that no additional amounts shall be payable in
relation to any payment in respect of any Note or Coupon:

(A) presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder who is liable to the Taxes in respect of
the Note or Coupon by reason of his having some connection with the Relevant Jurisdiction
other than the mere holding of the Note or Coupon;

(B) presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that
a holder would have been entitled to additional amounts on presenting the same for
payment on the last day of the period of 30 days assuming, whether or not such is in fact
the case, that day to have been a Presentation Date;

(C) presented for payment in the United Kingdom;

(D) presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such
withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note or Coupon to another Paying
Agent in a member state of the European Union; or

(E) presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such
withholding or deduction by presenting any form or certificate, or by making a declaration of
non-residence or other claim for exemption to the relevant tax authority.

**7.2** **Additional Amounts**

Any reference in these Conditions to any amounts in respect of the Notes shall be deemed also
to refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition or under any
undertakings given in addition to, or in substitution for, this Condition pursuant to the Trust Deed.

**8.** **Prescription**

Notes and Coupons will become void unless presented for payment within periods of 10 years
(in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date in respect
of the Notes or, as the case may be, the Coupons, subject to the provisions of Condition
5 (Payments).

**9.** **Events of Default**

The Trustee at its discretion may, and if so requested in writing by the holders of at least one
quarter in nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding or if so directed by an Extraordinary
Resolution shall (subject in each case to being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to
its satisfaction), (but in the case of the happening of any of the events described in paragraphs
(C), (D), (F), (G) or (I), only if the Trustee shall have certified in writing to the Issuer and the
Guarantor that such event is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial to the interests of the
Noteholders), give notice in writing to the Issuer that the Notes are, and they shall thereupon
immediately become, due and repayable at their principal amount together with accrued interest
as provided in the Trust Deed if any of the following events shall occur and be continuing
(“Events of Default”):

(A) default is made in the payment of any amount of principal or premium or purchase moneys
due under Condition 6.3 (Redemption of Notes upon a Change of Control) in respect of any
of the Notes for a period of seven days or more or any amount of interest in respect of any
of the Notes for a period of 21 days or more;

**10.** **Enforcement**

**10.1 Enforcement by the Trustee**

The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings against
the Issuer and/or the Guarantor as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed, the
Notes and the Coupons, but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other
action in relation to the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons unless (a) it has been so directed
by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at
least one-quarter in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and (b) it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.

**10.2 Enforcement by the Noteholders**

No Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer or the
Guarantor unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a
reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing.

**11.** **Replacement of Notes and Coupons**

Should any Note or Coupon be lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at
the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent upon payment by the claimant of the expenses
incurred in connection with the replacement and on such terms as to evidence and indemnity as
the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Notes or Coupons must be surrendered
before replacements will be issued.

**12.** **Notices**

**12.1 Notices to the Noteholders**

All notices to the Noteholders will be valid if published in a leading English language daily
newspaper published in London or such other English language daily newspaper with general
circulation in Europe as the Trustee may approve. It is expected that publication will normally be
made in the Financial Times. The Issuer shall also ensure that notices are duly published in a
manner which complies with the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or the relevant
authority on which the Notes are for the time being listed or by which they have been admitted to
listing. Any such notice will be deemed to have been given on the date of the first publication or,
where required to be published in more than one newspaper, on the date of the first publication

103


-----

in all required newspapers. If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be given
in such other manner, and shall be deemed to have been given on such date, as the Trustee
may approve. Couponholders will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of
any notice given to the Noteholders in accordance with this paragraph.

**12.2 Notices from the Noteholders**

Notices to be given by any Noteholder shall be in writing and given by lodging the same, together
with the relative Note or Notes, with the Principal Paying Agent or, if the Notes are held in a
clearing system, may be given through the clearing system in accordance with its standard rules
and procedures.

**13.** **Substitution**

The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders, the Guarantor or Couponholders,
agree with the Issuer to the substitution in place of the Issuer of the Guarantor or of any
Subsidiary of the Guarantor as principal debtor under the Trust Deed, the Notes and the
Coupons. The Trustee may also agree, without such consent as aforesaid, to the substitution of
a new group holding company of the Ladbrokes Coral group of companies in place of the
Guarantor if the Guarantor has or will be replaced as the ultimate holding company of the
Ladbrokes Coral group of companies by such new group holding company pursuant to an
amalgamation, merger or reconstruction the terms of which shall have been previously approved
in writing by the Trustee and which are not, in the opinion of an independent merchant or
investment bank of international repute appointed for such purpose by the Trustee (at the
request and expense of the Guarantor), materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.
Any such substitution shall be subject to such conditions as the Trustee may require and (in any
case where the Guarantor or any new group holding company of the Ladbrokes Coral group of
companies is not the new principal debtor or replaced as guarantor) to the unconditional and
irrevocable guarantee of the Guarantor.

**14.** **Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver, Authorisation and Determination**

**14.1 Meetings of Noteholders**

The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders to consider any
matter affecting their interests, including the sanctioning by Extraordinary Resolution of a
modification of the Notes, the Coupons or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed. Such a
meeting may be convened by the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Trustee and shall be convened by
the Issuer at the request of Noteholders holding not less than ten per cent, in nominal amount of
the Notes for the time being remaining outstanding. The quorum at any such meeting for passing
an Extraordinary Resolution is one or more persons holding or representing a clear majority in
nominal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one or
more persons being or representing Noteholders whatever the nominal amount of the Notes so
held or represented, except that at any meeting the business of which includes the modification
of certain provisions of the Notes, the Coupons or the Trust Deed (including modifying the date of
maturity of the Notes or any date for payment of interest thereon, reducing or cancelling the
amount of principal or the rate of interest payable in respect of the Notes or altering the currency
of payment of the Notes, or the Coupons, all as more particularly described in the Trust Deed),
the quorum shall be one or more persons holding or representing not less than two-thirds in
nominal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned such meeting
one or more persons holding or representing not less than one-third in nominal amount of the
Notes for the time being outstanding. The Trust Deed provides that (a) a resolution passed at a
meeting duly convened and held in accordance with the Trust Deed by a majority consisting of
not less than three-fourths of the votes cast on such a resolution, (b) a resolution in writing
signed by or on behalf of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal amount of the
Notes for the time being outstanding, or (c) consents given by way of electronic consents through
the relevant clearing system(s) (in a form satisfactory to the Trustee) by or on behalf of the
holder(s) of not less than three-fourths in nominal amount of the Notes for the time being
outstanding, shall, in each case, be effective as an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders.

modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of
these Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed or the Agency Agreement, or
determine, without any such consent as aforesaid, that any Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) shall not be treated as such (provided that, in any such
case, it is not, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the
Noteholders) or may agree, without any such consent as aforesaid, to any modification which, in
its opinion, is of a formal, minor or technical nature or to correct a manifest error or an error
which is, in the opinion of the Trustee, proven.

**14.3 Trustee to have regard to Interests of Noteholders as a Class**

In connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts, powers, authorities and discretions
(including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or
substitution), the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders as a class
but shall not have regard to any interests arising from circumstances particular to individual
Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their number) and, in particular but without limitation,
shall not have regard to the consequences of any such exercise for individual Noteholders or
Couponholders (whatever their number) resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or
resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory or
any political sub-division thereof and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any
Noteholder or Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee or
any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such
exercise upon individual Noteholders or Couponholders except to the extent already provided for
in Condition 7 (Taxation) and/or any undertaking given in addition to, or in substitution for,
Condition 7 (Taxation) pursuant to the Trust Deed.

**14.4 Notification to the Noteholders**

Any modification, abrogation, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution shall be binding
on the Noteholders and the Couponholders and, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise, any
modification or substitution shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as
practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices).

responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or
secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.

The Trust Deed also contains provisions pursuant to which the Trustee is entitled, inter alia,
(a) to enter into business transactions with the Issuer and/or the Guarantor and/or any of the
Guarantor’s other Subsidiaries and to act as trustee for the holders of any other securities issued
or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer and/or the Guarantor and/or any of the Guarantor’s
other Subsidiaries, (b) to exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform
its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such
trusteeship without regard to the interests of, or consequences for, the Noteholders or
Couponholders, and (c) to retain and not be liable to account for any profit made or any other
amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

**16.** **Further Issues**

The Issuer is at liberty from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders or
Couponholders, but subject always to the provisions of these Conditions and the Trust Deed, to
create and issue further notes or bonds (whether in bearer or registered form) either (a) ranking

105


-----

_pari passu in all respects (or in all respects save for the first payment of interest thereon) and so_
that the same shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding notes or bonds
of any series (including the Notes) constituted by the Trust Deed or any supplemental deed, or
(b) upon such terms as to ranking, interest, conversion, redemption and otherwise as the Issuer
may determine at the time of the issue. Any further notes or bonds which are to form a single
series with the outstanding notes or bonds of any series (including the Notes) constituted by the
Trust Deed or any supplemental deed shall, and any other further notes or bonds may (with the
consent of the Trustee), be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed. The Trust
Deed contains provisions for convening a single meeting of the Noteholders and the holders of
notes or bonds of other series in certain circumstances where the Trustee so decides.

**17.** **Listing**

So long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, each of the Issuer and the Guarantor has
covenanted in the Trust Deed that it shall use all reasonable endeavours to maintain the listing of
the Notes on the regulated market of the London Stock Exchange (as defined in the Trust Deed)
or, if it is unable to do so having used such endeavours, or if the maintenance of such listing is
reasonably considered by the Issuer to be unduly onerous, it shall use all reasonable endeavours
to obtain and maintain a quotation or listing of the Notes on such other stock exchange or
exchanges or securities market or markets as the Issuer may (with the prior written approval of
the Trustee) decide and shall also, upon obtaining a quotation or listing of the Notes on such
other stock exchange or exchanges or securities market or markets, enter into a trust deed
supplemental to the Trust Deed to effect such consequential amendments to the Trust Deed as
the Trustee may require or as shall be requisite to comply with the requirements of any such
stock exchange or securities market.

borrowings) since the beginning of such period that remains outstanding on such
Transaction Date or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio is an Incurrence of Debt, or both, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated

with respect to the Guarantor and its continuing Subsidiaries in connection with such asset
disposition for such period (or, if the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of it is sold, the

of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries for such period shall be calculated after giving pro
_forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Debt in accordance with paragraph (A)_
above and the increase to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) of the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries directly attributable to such investment or acquisition or a reduction of the
Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries directly attributable
to such investment or acquisition) as if such investment or acquisition occurred on the first
day of such period; and

(E) if since the beginning of such period any person that subsequently became a Subsidiary of
the Guarantor or was merged with or into the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of it since the
beginning of such period shall have made any asset disposition, investment or acquisition
of assets that would require an adjustment pursuant to paragraph (C) or (D) above if made
by the Guarantor or a Subsidiary of it during such period, Consolidated EBITDA and
Consolidated Interest Expense for of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries such period shall
be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Debt in
accordance with paragraph (A) above) as if such investment or acquisition occurred on the
first day of such period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an investment or an
acquisition or disposition of assets, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto and the
amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any Debt Incurred or repaid,
repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged in connection therewith, the pro forma
calculations shall be determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of
the Guarantor. Any such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the
reasonable good faith determination of the Guarantor, to reflect operating expense reductions
and other operating improvements or synergies reasonably expected to result from the
applicable pro forma event. If any Debt bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro
_forma effect, the interest expense on such Debt shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the_

**SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE REPRESENTED BY THE**
**GLOBAL NOTES**

The following is a summary of the provisions to be contained in the Trust Deed to constitute the Notes
and in the Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Conditions of the Notes
while the Notes are represented by the Global Notes.

**1.** **EXCHANGE**

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder)
for definitive Notes only:

(A) upon the happening and continuance of any of the events defined in Condition 9 as “Events of
Default”;

(B) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of
14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention
permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system
satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or

(C) if the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay additional amounts as provided for or referred to in
Condition 7 which would not be required were the Notes represented by the Permanent Global
Note in definitive form and a certificate to that effect signed by two Directors of the Issuer is
delivered to the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of (A) and (B) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on the
instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to
the Issuer and (in the case of (C) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the
Noteholders, of its intention to exchange the Permanent Global Note for definitive Notes on or after the
Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of I above,
shall surrender the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In
exchange for the Permanent Global Note the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal
aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (having attached to them all Coupons in respect of
interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note), security printed in
accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the
form set out in the Trust Deed. On exchange of the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will procure that
it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive
Notes.

For these purposes, “Exchange Date” means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling
not less than 45 days and not more than 60 days after that on which such notice is given and being a
day on which banks are open for general business in the place in which the specified office of the
Principal Paying Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (B) above, in the
place in which the relevant clearing system is located.

**2.** **PAYMENTS**

On and after [Š] 2016, no payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for an
interest in the Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused. Payments of principal and
interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note will, subject as set out below, be made to the
bearer of such Global Note against presentation for endorsement on or before the Snapshot Date and,
if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Notes, against surrender of such Global Note to
the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Paying Agent on or before the Snapshot Date as
shall have been notified to the Noteholders for such purposes. Payments of interest on the Temporary
Global Note (if permitted by the first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as
to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such certification has already been made.

118

**3.** **NOTICES**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global
Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices to Noteholders
may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the
case may be) for communication to the relative Accountholders rather than by publication as required
by Condition 12. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders on the day
on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be)
as aforesaid.

Whilst any of the Notes held by a Noteholder are represented by a Global Note, notices to be given by
such Noteholder may be given by such Noteholder to the Principal Paying Agent (where applicable)
through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and otherwise in such manner as the Principal
Paying Agent and Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may approve for this purpose.

**4.** **ACCOUNTHOLDERS**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global
Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each person (other than
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a particular principal amount of such Notes (each an
“Accountholder”) (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any
person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be
treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including but not limited
to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the
Noteholders and giving notice to the Issuer pursuant to Condition 9 or Condition 6.3) other than with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on such principal amount of such Notes, the right to
which shall be vested, as against the Issuer and the Trustee, solely in the bearer of the relevant Global
Note in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Trust Deed. Each Accountholder
must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, for its share of each
payment made to the bearer of the relevant Global Note.

**5.** **PRESCRIPTION**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantor in respect of principal and interest on the Notes

**UNITED KINGDOM TAXATION**

**General**

The comments below are of a general nature and are not intended to be exhaustive. They assume that
there will be no substitution of the Issuer or the Guarantor or further issues of securities that will form a
single series with the Notes, and do not address the consequences of any such substitution or further
issue (notwithstanding that such substitution or further issue may be permitted by the Conditions of the
Notes). Any Noteholders who are in doubt as to their own tax position should consult their professional
advisers.

**United Kingdom Taxation**

The comments in this part are based on current United Kingdom tax law as applied in England and
Wales and HM Revenue & Customs practice (which may not be binding on HM Revenue & Customs).
They describe only the United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments under the Notes. They
do not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of
the Notes. They do not necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the
income of any other person. They relate only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial
owners of their Notes and Coupons. In particular, Noteholders holding their Notes via a depositary
receipt system or clearance service should note that they may not always be the beneficial owners
thereof. Certain classes of persons such as dealers, certain professional investors, or persons
connected with the Issuer may be subject to special rules and this summary does not apply to such
Noteholders.

**_United Kingdom Withholding_**

_Interest on the Notes_

Once the Notes are and continue to be listed on a recognised stock exchange within the meaning of
Section 1005 Income Tax Act 2007, payments of interest by the Issuer on the Notes may be made
without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax. The London Stock
Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities will be treated as listed on
the London Stock Exchange if they are included in the Official List by the United Kingdom Listing
Authority and are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.

If the Notes are not or cease to be listed on a recognised stock exchange interest will generally be paid
by the Issuer under deduction of income tax at the basic rate unless: (i) another relief applies; or (ii) the
Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HM Revenue & Customs in respect of such relief
as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

If interest were paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax (for example if the Notes failed to
be listed on a recognised stock exchange), Noteholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom
may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an
applicable double taxation treaty.

_Payments in Respect of the Guarantee_

The United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments by the Guarantor under the terms of the
Guarantee in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the
repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by the
Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemption in respect of securities listed on a recognised stock
exchange described above in relation to payments of interest by the Issuer. Accordingly, if the
Guarantor makes any such payments, these may be subject to United Kingdom withholding tax at the
basic rate.

121

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder.

Each Bookrunner has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer,
sell or deliver the Notes and the Notes Guarantee (a) as part of their distribution at any time or
(b) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the Closing Date

the Notes Guarantee within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.
Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities
Act.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the Notes
Guarantee, an offer or sale of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee within the United States by any
dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities
Act.

**United Kingdom**

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**Japan**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act
of Japan (Act No. 25 of 1948, as amended, the “Financial **Instruments** **and** **Exchange**
**Act”). Accordingly, each Bookrunner has represented and agreed that it has not, directly or indirectly,**
offered or sold and will not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any Notes in Japan or to, or for the benefit
of, any resident of Japan (which term as used herein means any person resident in Japan, including
any corporation or other entity organised under the laws of Japan) or to others for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan except pursuant to
an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in compliance with, the Financial
Instruments and Exchange Act and other relevant laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.

122

**General**

Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor nor any Bookrunner has made any representation that any action
has been or will be taken by the Issuer, the Guarantor or any of the Bookrunners that would, or is
intended to, permit a public offer of the Notes in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for
that purpose is required. Accordingly, each Bookrunner has undertaken that it will comply to the best of
its knowledge and belief in any country or jurisdiction in which it, directly or indirectly, offers or sells any
Notes or distributes or publishes this Prospectus (in preliminary, proof or final form) or any other
offering circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other document or information
relating to the Notes in all material respects with any applicable laws and regulations.

published audited financial statements. Other than the Merger, there has been no significant change in

**5.** **LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**

**5.1** **Historic Ladbrokes Group**

(A) Save as disclosed in this section 5.1(A), there are no, nor have there been any,
governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings that are

124


-----

pending or threatened of which the Company and/or the Issuer is aware) during the 12
months prior to the date of this Prospectus that may have, or have had in the recent past
significant effects on the Company, the Issuer and/or the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s
financial position or profitability.

The Group is assisting Leicester City Council with its enquiries following an incident at one
of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s LBOs. In terms of enforcement action, the Council has
issued an improvement notice in connection with specific Historic Ladbrokes Group LBOs
that are located in the area regulated by Leicester City Council, which is being appealed by
the Group, with the appeal scheduled to be heard on 3 November 2016, unless adjourned.
The Historic Ladbrokes Group has also taken formal steps to prohibit Leicester City Council
from retaining and relying upon privileged material acquired during the course of its
investigation. If the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s appeal is unsuccessful, the Historic
Ladbrokes Group may be required to make changes to the operations of the relevant
LBOs. The potential impact of the improvement notice and any related operational changes
on the Historic Ladbrokes Group cannot currently be quantified.

(B) The Historic Ladbrokes Group has received communications from Mr. Dermot Desmond
threatening litigation arising out of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s acquisition of Global
Betting Exchange Alderny Limited (“Betdaq”) in 2013. The communications received do
not quantify the amount of any claim which Mr. Dermot Desmond may make, but the
Historic Ladbrokes Group considers his claims without merit and would defend such claims
were he (or any associated entity) to issue proceedings. As the Historic Ladbrokes Group
considers such claims to be without merit, it has not included such claims in section 5.1(A)
above. However, given the high profile nature of the Historic Ladbrokes Group’s
relationship with Mr. Dermot Desmond, the Historic Ladbrokes Group has included this
summary in the Prospectus to ensure that all Shareholders and prospective Shareholders
are properly informed.

**5.2** **Historic Coral Group**

There are no, nor have there been any, governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any
such proceedings that are pending or threatened of which the Company and/or the Issuer is aware)

Services Agreement conditional upon Completion (the “Marketing **Amendment**
**Agreement”). Pursuant to the Marketing Amendment Agreement, the existing terms of the**

followed by rolling five-year terms. There is a break clause in the Software Agreement that
entitles Ladbrokes International to terminate the Software Agreement on 25 December

On 23 July 2015, Ladbrokes International and PSL agreed to amend the Software
Agreement conditional upon Completion (the “Software Amendment Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Software Amendment Agreement, the existing break clause in the Software
Agreement has terminated and ceased to apply and has been replaced with a new break

alia, GCI agreed that it would not exercise its right to terminate the Coral Software

**11.** **BOOKRUNNERS TRANSACTING WITH THE ISSUER AND THE GUARANTOR**

Certain of the Bookrunners and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in
investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for the

128


-----

Issuer, the Guarantor and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Certain of the Bookrunners
and their affiliates may have positions, deal or make markets in the Notes, related derivatives and
reference obligations, including (but not limited to) entering into hedging strategies on behalf of the
Issuer, the Guarantor and their affiliates, investor clients, or as principal in order to manage their
exposure, their general market risk, or other trading activities.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Bookrunners and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantor or their affiliates. Certain of the Bookrunners or their affiliates
that have a lending relationship with the Issuer or the Guarantor routinely hedge their credit exposure
to the Issuer or the Guarantor (as the case may be) consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, such Bookrunners and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such positions could adversely affect future
trading prices of Notes. The Bookrunners and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities
or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short
positions in such securities and instruments.
