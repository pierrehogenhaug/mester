Under no circumstances shall this Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an

offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale
would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial

deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or affiliate on behalf of the issuer in such jurisdiction.

This Offering Memorandum is not being distributed by, nor has it been approved by, an authorized person in

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**

made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**

available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom
(“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;

FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.


-----

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be

made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of securities.

**MiFID II product governance / professional investors and ECPs only target market: solely for the**

purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only,
each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance / professional investors and ECPs only target market: solely for the**

purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No.
600/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention
and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**


**NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


**Reno De Medici S.p.A.**

**€590,000,000 Floating Rate Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2029**

__________________________

Reno De Medici S.p.A., a joint-stock company (società per azioni) established under the laws of the Republic of Italy (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €590.0 million aggregate principal

amount of its Floating Rate Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus % per annum,
reset quarterly. As of and from, 2026 (the “Step-Up Date”) this interest rate will increase by 0.125%, 0.250% or 0.375% depending on whether respectively, one, two or three Sustainability Performance
Targets (as defined herein) are not certified as achieved by the Testing Date (as defined herein), as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee (as defined herein) (with a copy to the Paying Agent (as defined herein))
on or prior to the Certification Date (as defined herein). See “Description of the Notes—Calculation of Interest.” Interest will be paid on the Notes quarterly in arrears on,, and each
year, commencing on, 2024. The Notes will mature on, 2029.

Proceeds from the Offering, will be used, directly or indirectly, to (i) redeem the Existing Notes (as defined herein) and pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, (ii) repay amounts outstanding

under and cancel the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility (as defined herein), including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined herein).
See “Use of Proceeds.”

At any time prior to, 2025, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice by paying a redemption price

equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus the relevant “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering memorandum (the
“Offering Memorandum”). In addition, prior to, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of
any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
date of redemption. At any time on or after, 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon
the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a
specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes by
paying a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of

payment to the Notes and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated
to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that will receive proceeds from any enforcement action over the Collateral (as defined herein) on a priority basis, including the Revolving Credit Facility,
to the extent of the value of such Collateral. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

On the Issue Date the Notes will not be guaranteed. No later than 60 days following the Issue Date, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and Agreed Security Principles (and to

certain significant limitation under applicable law), the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Guarantees”) by Fineska B.V., Eska B.V., Eska International B.V., Eska USA B.V. and R.D.M. Arnsberg
GmbH (the “Initial Guarantors”). In addition, after the Issue Date and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and Agreed Security Principles (and to certain significant limitation under applicable
law), the Notes will also be guaranteed on a senior basis by any other subsidiaries of the Issuer that become obligors under the Revolving Credit Facility from time to time (the “Additional Guarantors” and,
the Additional Guarantors together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured on or about the Issue Date by first-priority security interests over (i) all of the issued share

capital of the Issuer held by Rimini TopCo S.p.A. (together with successors and assigns “Topco”); (ii) receivables in respect of certain material loans into the Issuer in respect of which Topco is the creditor, if
any; and (iii) material operating bank accounts of the Issuer (collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”). Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Issue Date Collateral
will also secure obligations in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility. No later than 60 days after the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will
also be secured by first-priority security interests over (i) all of the issued share capital of each Initial Guarantor held by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) receivables in respect of certain material loans
in respect of which (x) the Issuer and any Initial Guarantor is a creditor and (y) any Initial Guarantor is a debtor (if any); and (iii) material operating bank accounts of each Initial Guarantor (collectively, the
“Additional Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”). See “Description of the Notes—Security; the Collateral.” The Notes and the security interests over the Collateral will
also be subject to restrictions on enforcement and other limitations under applicable laws and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and
_the Collateral” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in relation to any withholding or

deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Financial Services Act”) where the Notes are held by
a person resident in a country that does not allow for satisfactory exchange of information with Italy as included (i) in the Ministerial Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance of September 4, 1996, as
amended and supplemented from time to time or (ii) once effective, in any other decree or regulation that will be issued in the future pursuant to Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 or otherwise
in the circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.”

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Exchange’s Euro

MTF Market and to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange (the “Official List”) upon their issuance. There can be no assurance, however, that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange
or that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned upon obtaining this listing or permission to list.


**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 43 of this Offering Memorandum.**


**Issue Price for the Notes:      % plus accrued interest from the Issue Date, if any.**

We expect that the Notes will be delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) on or about, 2024 (the

“Issue Date”).

**This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation is unlawful. The Notes**

**and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any state of the United States or other**
**jurisdiction, and therefore may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation**
**S”)), except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or**
**other jurisdiction. The Notes and the Guarantees are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act**
**(“Rule 144A”), and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (provided that, if such persons are resident in the European Economic**
**Area or in the United Kingdom, they are qualified investors within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation or Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation (as applicable)).**
**Prospective investors are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Notes are not**
**transferable except in accordance with the restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions.”**

**_UK MiFIR product governance / professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the_**

purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook
Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made_**

available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom
(“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has**
been prepared, and therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be

made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**European Economic Area**

**_MiFID II product governance/professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes_**

of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as
defined in Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (“MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made

available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”)


-----

for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may
be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any member state

(“Member State”) of the EEA that is subject to the EU Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the EU Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. This
Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the EU Prospectus Regulation and any relevant
implementing measure in each member state of the EEA. No prospectus is required in accordance with the EU
Prospectus Regulation for this issue of Notes.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do

so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any
financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the

could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers’ demands and materially adversely affect our
financial results;

    - we may be unable to accurately predict our production demands and effectively manage our inventory;

    - the cyclical nature of our industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of
operations; an increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of energy could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations;

    - given that the majority of the Group entities are established in Italy, our business may be affected by
macroeconomic conditions and political uncertainty in Italy;

    - we operate in a highly competitive industry and measures taken by national governments or the EU may
distort competition in the industry;

    - new manufacturing and product technologies may affect our ability to compete successfully;

    - changes in consumer preferences and the regulatory environment may adversely affect our business;

    - our revenue is highly dependent on the continuity of relationships with our customers. Loss of a number
of customers and/or failure to diversify geographically could have an adverse impact on our business;

of our facilities. We could incur unforeseen capital expenditure costs and complications could arise
whenever when making investments in our operations which could adversely affect our business;

- any significant damage to one of our mills could cause a production disruption;

- issues relating to our product safety and liability could interrupt our production operations and we may
be required to pay damages or other remedies as a result of product liability claims;

- our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in
significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our
customers;

- we may not be able to successfully implement our cost reduction and efficiency improvement measures;

- the Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA information and other pro forma financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum are based on our current estimates, and they involve risks,

reputational harm and fraud;

    - our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all our losses; and

    - possible changes to tax law and regulations, as well as in the interpretation and application of tax
regulations by the relevant authorities in the countries where we operate may unfavorably increase our

relationship with us;

    - we may be negatively impacted by changes in the accounting standards, in their interpretation, or
involving their underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments; and

    - other risks associated with our indebtedness, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Collateral and the Offering.

The risks listed above and those further described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum

for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which
any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking

operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this Offering
Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which the statements were made.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether

as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**_Historical Financial Information_**

Topco is a holding company established on June 16, 2021 solely for the purpose of facilitating the RDM

Acquisition through its subsidiary Bidco (which subsequently merged into RDM). Topco, through its subsidiary
Bidco, acquired control of RDM on October 26, 2021, and began consolidating RDM’s results of operations as of and
from such date. Prior to the RDM Acquisition, results of operations were consolidated at the level of RDM, which
was the parent company of the Group.

For the period between its incorporation and the RDM Acquisition, Topco was not involved in any operating

activity except for those carried out in connection with the RDM Acquisition. Therefore, while Topco’s consolidated
statement of financial position as of December 31, 2021 reflects the full impact of the RDM Acquisition, Topco’s
consolidated statement of income and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2021 only includes the
results of operations of Bidco and RDM and its consolidated subsidiaries from October 26, 2021 to December 31,
2021. As a result and unless otherwise specified, in this Offering Memorandum we present consolidated financial
information for (i) Topco, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, and as of December 31, 2021;
and (ii) RDM, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Due to the change of control, the consolidated financial
information presented in this Offering Memorandum for RDM, prior to completion of the RDM Acquisition, and
Topco, after completion of the RDM Acquisition, are not comparable.

The consolidated financial information of the Group included in this Offering Memorandum has been

extracted or derived from:

    - the consolidated financial statements of RDM as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, prepared
in accordance with IFRS and audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A. (the “RDM Audited
**Consolidated Financial Statements”) including the audit report thereon;**

    - the consolidated financial statements of Topco as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2023, prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A. (the “Topco
**Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and together with the RDM Audited Consolidated**
Financial Statements, the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) including the audit reports
thereon.

The above Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are included in the F-pages to this Offering

Memorandum and should be read in conjunction with the relevant notes included therein.

Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the

differences between IFRS and other generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect
the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or
amendments of, IFRS principles may have on the Group’s results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as
on the comparability of financial information across periods. Historical consolidated financial information, whether
audited or not, is not indicative of future expected results.

**_Restatement of Topco’s consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2021_**

The consolidated statement of financial position of Topco as of December 31, 2021 included in the Topco

Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been restated following the completion of the purchase price
allocation relating to the RDM Acquisition. Specifically, the completion of this process resulted in a reduction of
goodwill in the amount of €264.7 million, a positive change in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment
of €265.9 million, and a positive change in the carrying amount of intangible assets of €94.6 million. Deferred tax
liabilities of €99.5 million were also recognized.


-----

**_Pro forma financial information_**

The Issuer has prepared the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information included in this Offering

Memorandum, which includes a pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023
together with related explanatory notes (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information”).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared to give pro forma effect,

as applicable and as the context requires, to the Fiskeby Acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2023. The Unaudited
Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not give any pro forma effect to the Transactions.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared on a voluntary basis for

inclusion in this Offering Memorandum and is presented for illustrative purposes only and reflects certain estimates
and assumptions. The pro forma and other adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described in the notes
accompanying the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. The pro forma adjustments are based
on the information available at the time of the preparation of this Offering Memorandum. While we consider these
estimates and assumptions to be reasonable based on the information available as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the actual impact of the Fiskeby Acquisition and the other events reflected in the pro forma financial
information may have on our results of operations in future periods may differ materially from what is shown in the
Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information presented in this Offering Memorandum.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not purport to represent what the actual

consolidated statement of income would have been if the Fiskeby Acquisition had occurred on the date indicated and
is not intended to project the consolidated results of operations for any future period or date.

In this Offering Memorandum, we also present certain adjusted pro forma financial information that has not

been prepared on the same basis as the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, as it reflects
additional or different pro forma assumptions or events, including to give pro forma effect to certain non-recurring
items and normalization adjustments, as further described in “Summary Financial and Other Information.”

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information and the adjusted pro forma financial

information have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the
EU Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any other set of generally accepted accounting
standards. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Italy) or any other auditing standards.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been derived from, and should be read in

conjunction with, the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
See “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information” for further information.

**_Non-IFRS Financial Measures_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA,

EBITDA Margin, Net Financial Debt, Cash Conversion and Capital Expenditures (collectively the “Non-IFRS
**Financial Measures”).We believe that these Non-IFRS Financial Measures provide useful and relevant information**
for analyzing our financial performance and financial condition. We also believe they facilitate management’s ability
to identify operational trends and make decisions regarding resource allocations and other operational decisions and
use them for such purposes.

Set forth below are the Non-IFRS Financial Measures used in this Offering Memorandum:

    - “EBITDA” calculated as profit (loss) for the period adjusted for (i) profit (loss) for the period of
discontinued operations, (ii) taxes, (iii) gains (losses) on investments, (iv) net financial income
(expense), (v) depreciation and amortization and (vi) write-downs and revaluations.

    - “EBITDA Margin” calculated as EBITDA as a percentage of revenues from sales.


-----

- “Net Financial Debt” calculated as the sum of (i) current and non-current payables to banks and other
lenders and (ii) current and non-current derivative instrument liabilities, less the sum of (iii) cash and
cash equivalents, (iv) current financial assets and (v) current derivative instruments assets.

- “Capital Expenditures” calculated as investments in tangible assets and intangible assets.

- “Maintenance Capital Expenditure” calculated as working and ordinary capital expenditure to
maintain a certain level of productivity.

- “Cash Conversion” calculated as EBITDA less Maintenance Capital Expenditure.

- “Cash Conversion Ratio” calculated as Cash Conversion divided by EBITDA.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted Cash Conversion” calculated as the sum of Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma
EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, excluding maintenance capital expenditures incurred at
our Blendecques mill for the year ended December 31, 2023, but including maintenance capital
expenditures incurred by the Fiskeby Group for the period from January 1, 2023 to completion of the
Fiskeby Acquisition.

- “Pro Forma Revenues from Sales” which reflects revenues from sales for the year ended December
31, 2023 as if the Fiskeby Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023.

- “Adjusted Pro Forma Revenues from Sales” which reflects Pro Forma Revenues from Sales for the
year ended December 31, 2023, as further adjusted as if RDM Blendecques S.A.S. was no longer within
the scope of consolidation of the Group as of and from January 1, 2023.

- “Pro Forma EBITDA” calculated as pro forma profit (loss) for the period adjusted for (i) profit (loss)
for the period of discontinued operations, (ii) pro forma taxes, (iii) pro forma gains (losses) on
investments, (iv) pro forma net financial income (expense), (v) pro forma depreciation and amortization
and (vi) pro forma write-downs and revaluations.

- “Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA” calculated as Pro Forma EBITDA further adjusted for certain nonrecurring items and normalization adjustments as well as pro forma cost savings. Although management
believes these items are unusual, non-recurring or unrepresentative of our underlying performance, there
can be no assurance that we will not incur these or similar costs in the future.

- “Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA” calculated as Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, further
adjusted for the estimated run-rate effect from structural cost savings and synergies expected to be
generated from certain capital expenditures initiatives implemented in 2023, and the integration of
Fiskeby into our operations following completion of the Fiskeby Acquisition.

- **“Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA Margin” is defined as Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma**
EBITDA Margin expressed as a percentage of Adjusted Pro Forma Revenues from Sales.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted Net Financial Debt” calculated as (i) adjusted pro forma payables to banks and
other lenders (excluding any Notes issuance costs) _less_ (ii) as adjusted cash and cash equivalents
calculated, in each case as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they occurred on
December 31, 2023, as further described in the “Capitalization” section of this Offering Memorandum.

- “Pro Forma Adjusted Net Senior Secured Debt” calculated as the outstanding senior secured debt of
the Group, net of as adjusted cash and cash equivalents calculated, in each case, as adjusted to give pro
_forma effect to the Transactions as if they occurred on December 31, 2023, as further described in the_
“Capitalization” section of this Offering Memorandum.


-----

    - “Pro Forma Adjusted Interest Expense” calculated as the cash interest expense as if the Transactions
had occurred on January 1, 2023.

    - “Ratio of Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA to Pro Forma Adjusted Interest Expense”
calculated as Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA divided by Pro Forma Adjusted Interest Expense.

    - “Ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted Net Financial Debt to Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA”
calculated as Pro Forma Adjusted Net Financial Debt divided by Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA.

    - “Ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted Net Senior Secured Debt to Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma
**EBITDA” calculated as Pro Forma Adjusted Net Senior Secured Debt divided by Run Rate Adjusted**
Pro Forma EBITDA.

In addition, in this Offering Memorandum we present certain financial information for the Group and the

Fiskeby Group, including revenue and EBITDA, on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
(the “Combined Group Financial Information”). The Combined Group Financial Information is calculated by
aggregating the stand-alone financial information of the Group and the Fiskeby Group without applying any pro forma
adjustments.

The main differences between the Combined Group Financial Information and the Unaudited Pro Forma

Consolidated Financial Information are related to the alignment of the accounting policies of the Fiskeby Group to
those applied by the Group and the simulation of the impacts of the application of the IFRS on the consolidated
financial information of the Fiskeby Group.

For a description of how our Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Combined Group Financial Information are

calculated from our consolidated results from operations and a reconciliation of our Non-IFRS Financial Measures
and Combined Group Financial Information to our results for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum,
please see “Summary Financial and Other Information.” In addition, to enhance comparability across period, in this
Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial metrics as if Blendecques was classified as discontinued
operations and was excluded from the Group’s consolidation perimeter as of January 1, 2023.

These and other Non-IFRS Financial Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum may be used by

different companies for different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the business environment and
circumstances of those companies. These and other Non-IFRS Financial Measures may also differ from corresponding
or similar terms as defined in and calculated in accordance with the Indenture. You should exercise caution in
comparing these and other Non-IFRS Financial Measures to similar measures used by other companies. The
information presented by each of these and other Non-IFRS Financial Measures is unaudited and has not been prepared
in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards.

These and other Non-IFRS Financial Measures we present in this Offering Memorandum should be

considered supplemental to the measurements of performance and financial position that are calculated and presented
in accordance with IFRS, and they should not be used or interpreted in isolation. These measures are not measurements
of performance under IFRS or any other accounting principles and you should not consider them as alternatives to
other indicators of financial performance, financial position or cash flow prepared in accordance with IFRS. You are
encouraged to review the adjustments reflected in our presentation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures and
independently evaluate whether you consider each one of these adjustments to be appropriate.

Our Non-IFRS Financial Measures have important limitations as analytical tools, including, among others:

    - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

    - they do not reflect any expenses related to the payment of taxes, including those requiring cash payments;


-----

    - they are not adjusted for all cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash
flows;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized
will often have to be replaced in the future;

    - they may include adjustments for the impact of charges or expenses resulting from certain matters we
do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance;

    - they may include adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies and other estimates that may not be
realized in full, or at all; and

    - they do not fully reflect the impact of COVID-19 on our performance.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures and percentages set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data

presented in millions or in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data
in the Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. In addition, as
a result of the aforementioned rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented in tabular form may differ
from the information that would have appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial information.

**Overview**

We are a leading European producer and distributor of recycled cartonboard, active in the coated and

uncoated recycled cartonboard industry. We operate in the white lined chipboard (“WLC”) and solidboard (“SB”)
market segments, in each case with a demonstrated track record of making our operations more sustainable as both
WLC and SB are manufactured from recovered paper and we actively invest in our operations to reduce emissions,
waste, water usage and other environmental factors. Our cartonboard can be used as both primary and secondary
packaging. Our WLC products are predominantly used, without limitation, in packaging for the food, hygiene and
cleaning, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, electronics, textile and toy industries. Our SB products are mostly used
for the packaging of luxury goods, publishing applications (bookbinding), as well as for graphical applications, such
as for puzzles and games.

Our identity is built on a clear vision centered on the circular economy that guides our activities as a

manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, and that represents a balanced combination between our
business and the expectations of our stakeholders; see also “Business—Our Production Process—Circular Business
_Model.” Our ambition is to be the partner of choice of all key stakeholders with three strategic goals in mind: to_
offer excellent products and services, to optimize costs and to maximize the satisfaction of our customers, all while
helping drive increased sustainability within the paper and packaging industry.

As of December 31, 2023, we served our customers through a network of ten mills (including

Blendecques), four sheeting and distribution centers, and 13 sales offices. As of December 31, 2023, we employed
over 2,520 employees.

We believe that our geographical footprint across Europe and exposure to resilient end-markets (such as

the food end-market) are key strengths of our business, which we have reinforced through the recent Fiskeby
Acquisition in 2023 (in addition to Eska and Paprinsa Acquisitions in 2021). Our position as a leader in the European
WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills, our “multi-mill” concept, whereby we seek to be able
to offer similar cartonboard products at different mills whenever possible, helping us meet our customers’ demands
quickly regardless of their proximity to a specific production site, and guarantee security of supply to our entire
customer base. Our distributed mill network is integrated by our “One Company” operating model, which helps to
ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and sophistication required
to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent.

    - **_WLC. In our WLC market segment, we produce cartonboard from recycled fibers for folding carton_**
and corrugated packaging applications. According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data provided
by a global management consulting company, we are the largest non-integrated WLC producer (based
on annual production capacity as of December 31, 2023), with a market share of approximately 27%
for the year ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) by
volumes sold, in a rather consolidated European market. In terms of production capacity, WLC
represents approximately 79% of our business as of December 31, 2023 (giving pro forma effect to
the Fiskeby Acquisition).

    - We had a total WLC production capacity of 1,350 thousand tons per year for the year ended
December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) of which 110 thousand

1


-----

tons was attributable to our Blendecques mill, which we are planning to close by the second half of
2024 as discussed further under “Summary—Recent Developments—Closure of the Blendecques mill.”

    - **_SB. In our SB market segment, we produce SB from recycled fibers for packaging and graphical_**
applications. We had a total production capacity of 360 thousand tons per year for the year ended
December 31, 2023. In terms of production capacity, SB represents approximately 21% of our business
as of December 31, 2023. We are a leading SB producer with a global reach. Following the Eska
Acquisition, we now have three industry-leading SB production facilities (in terms of production
capacity) across The Netherlands and Italy, with the largest SB production capacity among participants
in the core market segments in which Eska operates (which include luxury packaging, bookbinding,
puzzles and games) for the year ended December 31, 2023.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition

as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023), we generated Adjusted Pro Forma Revenues from Sales of €844.6 million
and Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of €157.7 million (representing a margin of 18.7%) and we sold
approximately 1,018 thousand tons (excluding Blendecques). The charts below present the breakdown of our tons
sold by geography, by relevant end-market and by product, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2023. The
following graphs show tons sold splits of the Group (after giving pro forma affect to the Fiskeby Acquisition).

Source: Company information.

As of December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition), we served over 2,500

customers across our WLC and SB market segments and sold our products, either directly or indirectly, in over 100
countries worldwide.

We remain united by our “One Company” culture and philosophy and believe that the size of our network

and breadth of our geographical footprint give us significant competitive advantages, including greater operational
flexibility to serve our customers and manufacture our products across our network of mills, as well as enhanced
capacity to supply our products in a timely manner and the flexibility to produce our products at more than one mill.
While our network of nine paper mills is strategically located to best serve our pan-European customer base, which
requires localized service, our operations remain integrated. We centrally manage operations, and we are currently
enhancing our ability to integrate operations across our network by implementing the same ERP systems in all of
our mills. Additionally, improvements to our information technology (“IT”) resources have allowed, and we believe
we will continue to allow, us to balance the availability of products across our network of mills, to optimize
profitability and proximity to customers, to protect their security of supply and to mitigate the risks posed by market
volatility arising from changes in the supply and demand dynamics in local markets. Over the last two years, we
have pursued a broad array of technology initiatives including the creation of sophisticated digital applications to
deliver high-quality and innovative products across the entire value chain as well as the roll-out of a comprehensive
digital transformation program aimed at achieving efficiencies through all areas of the Group, including projects on
operations, logistics, procurement, human resources, sales, planning and health and safety. Key IT products include

-----

the internal tools for corporate management performance, managerial reporting, human capital management and
portfolio project management. We will continue to implement technological development initiatives to pursue our
lean manufacturing philosophy, including through new analytic initiatives to enhance quality integration,
procurement, pricing and supply chain savings.

**_Our products and customers_**

We manufacture different types of recycled paperboard, sold as sheets or rolls, mainly to packaging

manufacturers. The majority of our sales derive from resilient and essential end-markets, such as the food
end-market.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition),

more than 59% of the end-users of our WLC products operated within the resilient food market. Our SB products
are purchased for use in applications such as producing packaging for the growing luxury packaging market, as well
as bookbinding, stationary, and manufacturing puzzles and games.

We are committed to sustainability and believe that are well-placed to benefit from the ongoing shift away

from plastic packaging and toward more sustainable alternatives. We believe that we have an attractive sustainability
profile, and our commitment to sustainability has been historically supported by a track record of demonstrable
achievements. For the year ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition),
approximately 95% of the fibrous material we used was recycled and over 84% of all materials used consisted of
renewable materials. In addition, we have reduced our water discharges per ton of cartonboard produced by
approximately 15% since 2020.

As our business continues to evolve, we remain committed to strengthening our product portfolio and

offerings by focusing on renewable, recyclable and actually-recycled solutions (solutions with high recycling rates).
In line with the latest market trends, we are directing our development activities toward cartonboard and SB products
that can replace plastic packaging and are safe to be used for food product. We are focusing our efforts toward the
development of renewable and recyclable “barrier solutions” that are fully integrated with the fiber-based material
structure of the cartonboard. Our consistent aim is to promote and preserve the integrity of the packaged product
while ensuring recyclability of the coated and uncoated cartonboard after its use. In particular, the key themes of
our product innovation are (i) plastic to paper, with a focus on safety for food applications and barriers for grease,
water and oxygen; (ii) digitalization experience by delivering WLC and SB designed for e-commerce; (iii)
environmental experience with a continued focus on alternative sources for fibers and (iv) premium experience by
delivering premium materials and bi-colors board.

We are also currently developing a portfolio of new sustainable solutions to be rolled-out between 2025

and 2028, which we expect will increase our production volumes by more than 300 thousand tons per year. We are
committed to increase transparency in sustainability. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the external validation
of the carbon footprint of our products and undergoing a third-party life cycle assessment. These activities will allow
us to evaluate sustainability claims and prioritize product initiatives with higher sustainability score.

**Key Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths.

**_We are the leader in the attractive WLC market, well supported by the long-term plastic substitution_**

**_macrotrend._**

With a total WLC production capacity of 1,350 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31,

2023 (after giving _pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition and including Blendecques), we have the largest_
production capacity of WLC across Europe and the largest market share (27%) by volumes sold. Our position as a
leader in the European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills integrated by our “One
Company” operating model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform
with the scale and sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent.

As a leading WLC manufacturer, we are in the position to benefit from the growth and evolution of the

WLC market. Industry sources indicate that the WLC market segment is resilient and diversified. Just as the demand
for WLC ultimately depends on the demand from the end markets, the resilience of the WLC industry is also
supported by the diversity and by the resilience of the industry’s end markets.

The chart below is based on analysis from a global management consulting company and highlights how

the WLC demand is driven by the stable and resilient food end-market. Food end-market demand is defined by
different sub-segments, such as frozen and chilled food (19% of total demand), driven by demographic changes and
convenience trends, dry food (16% of total demand) and other food sub-segments (12% of total demand). Overall
the broad food end-market represents approximately 38% of the total demand for WLC.

We believe a number of market trends will continue to support WLC market development in Europe over

the next several years – with Southern Europe expected to experience even stronger demand growth as a
consequence of WLC’s stronger position in the region – and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these
trends.

In particular, we believe there is a positive outlook for WLC over the next five years, as plastics

replacement trials start to move through to larger scale rollout. According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data
provided by a global management consulting company, there will be an additional market demand for 900 thousand

4


-----

tons of WLC products between 2023 and 2028 (of which 160 thousand tons are expected by the end of 2024) due
to plastic replacement opportunities. Primarily, these opportunities are present in the food and homecare sectors due
to cartonboard’s strength and barrier properties, which make it a suitable substitution for fruit punnets, confectionery
secondary packaging and dishwasher tablets or dilutables. To a lesser extent, there are additional opportunities in
the beverage, cosmetics and pharma sectors as the cartonboard’s structural integrity, premium finish together with
its other properties make it a good fit to drink multipacks, secondary packaging for cosmetic tubs and tubes or
primary packaging for multivitamins. We also believe that the growing preference for sustainable products, along
with increasing regulatory actions against the use of plastics and plastic packaging, will likely lead a growing
number of manufacturers to switch from plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, such as the WLC
packaging made from recycled fibers that we produce.

Additionally, we expect that e-commerce growth will drive demand for WLC liners used in packaging

production. We expect that demographic shifts and changes in consumer preferences favoring convenience will
increase the demand for frozen and convenience foods, and these segments of the food end-market are especially
heavy users of WLC packaging.

The charts below illustrate (based on analysis from a global management consulting company) the

estimated growth in WLC usage in Southern Europe for the periods indicated, as well as the estimated growth (2019
– 2030) for the various WLC end segments. These changes are driven by, among others, a preference for fiber-based
materials and sustainable products, increased popularity of frozen and chilled foods driven by geographic changes
and convenience trends, and increased focus on replacement of plastic packaging by sustainable options in light of
brand owners’ and retailers’ sustainability targets in response to increasing consumer sentiment favoring
sustainability.

While these trends benefit the WLC market as whole, we believe our commitment to sustainability,

leadership in the circular economy with recycled WLC production, and established presence in serving the food
end-market uniquely position us to capture the potential growth in WLC demand driven by these factors. We believe

that there is material industry growth upside associated with increased plastic substitution, as illustrated in the chart
above.

**_We also have a presence in the resilient and growing SB industry and are well-positioned to benefit from_**

**_further growth._**

As shown in the following graph, our SB production capacity ranks among the largest SB producers in

Europe.

(1) Integrated to converting; still including the recently announced closure of a 75Kton mill in the Netherlands.

The SB market segment is a stable and resilient market given the defensive characteristics of the main end
use markets, such as bookbinding and stationery. The graph below illustrates the estimated growth, according to
management estimates, of the global SB market for the periods indicated in thousands of tons.

Source: Company information

Industry sources expect that the global SB market will reach around 8.4 million tons by 2027. This growth

is primarily driven by: (i) strong opportunities in luxury packaging, an end-market expected to grow at a CAGR of
approximately 1.7% to 2027, as a result of increasing disposable incomes worldwide and increasing requests for
innovative, aesthetically pleasing and high quality products; (ii) developments in bookbinding and stationery, driven
by rising literacy rates in emerging markets and rising incomes in Asia; and (iii) increasing popularity in puzzles

6


-----

and games due to an increased desire to disconnect from the digital world and from the innovative development of
puzzles and games. We believe that the US market also represents an important growth opportunity, including for
our WLC market segment, and we are relocating our sheeting and distribution center in Virginia from Chesapeake
to a larger site in Suffolk, to leverage our growth in such market.

The graph below illustrates the SB market segmented by end-use for the year ended 2019 (expressed in

percentages and excluding SB packaging).

Source: Company information

The trend towards sustainable and recyclable products further favors the use of SB, a material that is fully

recyclable, instead of plastics, and we expect to have the opportunity to drive plastic substitution via the SB market
as well, helping to further increase packaging sustainability while simultaneously increasing our company’s
financial performance and growth.

Through the acquisition of Eska, which complemented our previous acquisition of the Ovaro mill and

significantly increased our production capacity of SB products, which evolved from a minor part of our portfolio to
representing a key component of our product offering, we believe we have further expanded our products and
offerings in the SB market segment and we are well positioned to continue to expand.

**_We have a diversified product portfolio focused on essential and resilient end-markets with a well-_**

**_diversified and not concentrated customer base._**

Our business benefits from a diverse customer base and low customer concentration. For the year ended

December 31, 2023, we had a customer base of over 2,500 customers (giving _pro forma_ effect to the Fiskeby
Acquisition and including our Blendecques mill), with no single client representing more than 4% of our sales
volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest customers accounted for 22% of our total sales by
volume, and our top 100 customers accounted for approximately 64% of our total sales by volume (in each case
calculated giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition and including our Blendecques mill).

Although our customers serve participants in a number of end-markets, almost half of our products are

ultimately used in the uniquely attractive and resilient food end-market. In 2023, this end-market accounted for 49%
of our total sales by volume. The chart below indicates, for the period ended December 31, 2023, our exposure to
various end-use markets (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby and including Blendecques). The chart below
indicates our exposure to end-markets as of December 31, 2023.

(1) Includes pharma & healthcare, detergents & cleanings, beauty & cosmetics, household kitchen and gardening, IT electronics media and
technical.

(2) Includes stationery, display & showcards, bookbinding.

In addition, we expect the use of WLC packaging to increase in the food end-market as well as in the

pharmaceutical and cosmetics end-markets in response to consumer preferences for sustainability and increased
regulation for the reduction of plastic packaging use. We also believe that the higher demand for frozen and
convenience foods will further support food as being an attractive end-market for our business.

**_Pan-European, strategic asset base close to customers providing significant competitive advantages._**

We operate in accordance with our “multi-mill” and “multi-country” approaches, which we believe provide

us with significant competitive advantages in our sector, particularly given the highly localized nature of our
customers and the industry. Our multi mill concept represents one of our core operating principles. We aim to
produce our products in multiple mills whenever possible to ensure that our products are available to our customers
in a flexible and punctual manner and in close proximity to their production sites. We believe that the multi mill
concept allows us to adapt efficiently to changes in market demand and the economic cycles of the countries in
which we operate. We believe we have a well invested asset base, in terms of capacity, technical age, speed and
trim compared to our industry peers, which enables us to effectively pursue our “multi-mill” concept. As of
December 31, 2023, we served our customers through a network of ten mills (including Blendecques), four sheeting
and distribution centers, and 13 sales offices. Our mills are located in Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, Germany,
France and Sweden, giving us a pan European and strategic asset base close to our customers. As further discussed
under “Summary—Recent Developments—Closure of the Blendecques mill,” we are currently planning to cease
operations at the mill located in Blendecques, France, by the second half of 2024. Rather than managing each single
mill to produce a single product, our mills are designed, and operate, to manufacture multiple products whenever
possible. As a result, we can shift production of many of our products across our network of mills, which gives us
flexibility to balance the availability of products at individual plants and to integrate production planning across our
mills. We also believe that our multi-mill concept reinforces the benefits that we derive from our multi-country asset
base. By increasing the interchangeability of our mills and the specific types of our cartonboard produced in multiple
mills, we also increase our ability to meet our customers’ needs at each local plant. This allows us to reduce the time
and cost required for product delivery and to be more immediately responsive to customers’ needs and changing
demands, providing meaningful upside in a market characterized by localized preferences and requirements. Our
focus on coordination within our multi-mill network also allows us to monitor and better respond to market volatility
arising from rapid changes in local demand or changes in production at individual mills as well as from potential
supply chain disruptions.

As part of the integration of the Fiskeby business following the Fiskeby Acquisition, we have successfully

applied our multi-mill concept to the Swedish plant. We believe that the multi-mill concept and post-acquisition

8


-----

integration will allow us to transfer production volumes to different locations to reduce delivery times for existing
customers as well as to find new and more profitable markets and volumes.

**_We have historically demonstrated the ability to navigate in volatile environment delivering strong_**

**_financial performance._**

Starting from 2021 and 2022, as part of an industry-wide unprecedented and temporary phenomenon

affecting our entire value chain, we have experienced significant stocking and de-stocking dynamics, which resulted
in a divergence of patterns between consumption by our customers, on the one hand, and supply dynamics in our
product end-markets, on the other hand.

In particular, in 2021 and the first half of 2022, we experienced increased stocking by many of our

customers, which was primarily driven by their need to secure higher levels of inventories to meet expected market
demand and address supply chain uncertainty caused by macroeconomic concerns, such as supply chain disruptions
related to COVID-19 and other factors and heightened international tensions due to the conflict in Ukraine.
Conversely, starting in the second half of 2022, we experienced a decrease in the sale of our products, primarily as
a result of the reduction in purchase volumes by some of our customers who implemented de-stocking policies.
Such customers started reviewing their inventory management policies and decreased the level of our products held
in stock as they prepared for a generally improved macroeconomic environment in 2023 and as a result of a decrease
in sales of their products in certain end-markets, which was driven by several macroeconomic factors, including a
persisting inflationary environment, a material increases in global interest rates and general softness of private
consumption with end-customers showing recessionary behaviors.

We believe the de-stocking trend has now ended, as the stock of WLC in the European market is currently

very low as illustrated by the below chart from the European association representing the paper industry (“CEPI”).

This is also supported by the strong uptick in order intakes that the WLC European market is currently

experiencing, as illustrated by the below chart (source: CEPI), which clearly indicates that the demand is picking
up.

-----

The decline in demand was coupled with a reduction in input costs, including the price of wastepaper

starting from the third quarter of 2022 and a normalization of energy costs starting from fourth quarter 2022. While
the lower demand and lower raw material prices generated some pressure on selling prices and we have slightly
revised our selling prices downward, we have managed to do that at a slower pace compared to our competitors due
to our capacity management and volume placement.

Importantly, due to our leading market position and size, we have been very disciplined on pricing and able

to retain more of the increase in our selling prices that we achieved over 2021 and 2022 versus the reduction in input
costs seen over the last year, allowing us to stabilize our contribution margin around €320 per ton over 2023. As
illustrated by the below chart, our current level of profitability is much higher compared that what we have been
able to achieve historically. We expect this level of contribution margin per ton to be sustainable. Additionally, we
did not sacrifice material market share to achieve this result.

(2) Figures including the La Rochette Disposal the Paprinsa Acquisition, the Eska Acquisition and the Fiskeby Acquisition.

While through Fiskeby we also enter into long-term agreements with some of our brand partners, we are

otherwise generally not bound by long-term sales contracts, but operate instead through budget agreements and
purchase orders, which gives us flexibility to respond to market conditions. See also “Business—Our Customers

_and Stakeholders.” Given the encouraging order intake in the beginning of 2024 and the persisting inflationary_
environment, we have recently announced a price increase of approximately €60 per ton (representing an increase
of approximately 8% compared to our prices in December 2023) on WLC products starting from March 2024. We
believe this will continue to have a positive impact on our profitability.

Our adaptive strategy has allowed our business to navigate through periods of macroeconomic instability

and despite volatility in the paper and packaging sector across since 2021. The following graph shows the Group’s
success in EBITDA growth since 2021.

**_We have demonstrated the ability to realize cost savings well above the initially identified targets._**

At the time of RDM Acquisition, we conservatively identified approximately €20 million of annual gross

cost savings. Since then, we have revised the amount of initiatives we expect to be able to achieve upwards, reaching
a total €64 million at the end of year 2028. These initiatives include (but are not limited to):

      - **_Plant initiatives: investment in new equipment and machinery upgrades at the plant level to_**
reduce variable costs of production and decrease waste while ensuring better quality and higher
production volumes;

      - **_Energy opportunities: investment in new co-generation equipment and other energy equipment_**
to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions;

**_We play a central role in the sustainable paper circular economy and have developed a record of_**

**_successfully executing our sustainability initiatives. We aim to continue to be a leader in this field and achieve_**
**_our well-identified long-term sustainability goals._**

As a manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, we view ourselves as playing a key role in

maintaining a sustainable circular economy. The primary raw material used in our manufacturing process is paper
for recycling (“PfR”) and paperboard obtained from municipal paper collection and commercial or industrial
sources. We believe we are the keystone “link” in the circular economy: we dissolve, treat and form wastepaper into
recycled cartonboard, giving it new life and use. Our WLC products are mainly sold to customers in the converting
industry, who manufacture packaging using the WLC we provide, while our SB products are sold to customers in
industries such as printing and bookbinding as well as to converters for use in packaging. After passing through the
end-user, these materials can be recycled and resupplied to us as raw materials for use in the manufacturing of new
WLC or SB.

All of our products are fully recyclable, enabling them to be converted to packaging at a later stage.

Furthermore, for the year ended December 30, 2023, approximately 95% of the fibrous materials we used came
from recycled materials and over 84% of all materials used consisted of renewable materials, enabling us to foster
the circular economy.

13


-----

In addition in 2022, we implemented strategic initiatives for the management and improvement of the

quality of the water used in the production from the mills of Hoogezand, Santa Giustina and Barcelona, that allow
us to recycle the process water. In 2023, we invested in the development of the Ovaro power plant. These successful
initiatives further improved our water efficiency and contributed to strong operational performance. We have also
started building a new CHP plant in Barcelona to further reduce our GHG Emissions and achieve cost savings,
which we expect will be completed in the end of the second quarter of 2024.

The graph below depicts our contribution to the circular economy. For further detail, see also “Business—

_Our Production Process—Circular Business Model.”_

Source: Company information

Guided by this clear, shared vision as well as by our core commitment to sustainability and the circular

economy, we have established long-term sustainability goals and developed a track record of making our operations
more sustainable.

Going forward, we intend to build on these successes to achieve our long-term sustainability goals with

respect to promoting water efficiency, reducing the effects of climate change, waste reduction and increased
recovery, employee safety and wellbeing, diversity and responsible sourcing of materials. See also “Business—
_Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters.”_

**_We are led by an experienced and effective management team._**

We benefit from an experienced management team led by our Chief Executive Officer, Michele Bianchi,

who has over 25 years of experience within the industry, having served as Managing Director at both DS Smith and
SCA/DS Smith Packaging. In addition, we benefit from the deep experience of our Chief Financial Officer, Simone
Montanari, who has over 25 years of experience within finance departments (previously CFO at Comau, Moncler
and Piaggio Group), and Andrea Bettinelli, our Head of Strategy, who has over 14 years of experience at RDM,
among other businesses. Other individuals with an important impact on our operations are Pierre-Yves Corbiere
(Chief Sales Officer), Gianluca Scaglioni (Head of Operations) and Krzysztof Krajewski (Chief Sustainability and
Innovation Officer) with 19, 27 and 22 years, respectively, of relevant experience in the industry. For further

**Business Strategy**

**_Further strengthen our positioning in the WLC market and expansion in the SB market._**

Through the Eska Acquisition and Paprinsa Acquisition, we have acquired three additional production

sites, expanded our SB product offerings, solidified our market leadership on the Iberian Peninsula, and broadened
the geographic footprint of our network of mills into The Netherlands and distribution centers into the United States.
Furthermore, with the Fiskeby acquisition we have grown our market share in the recycled board market, broadened
the geographic footprint of our network of mills into Sweden and became the largest independent recycled board
producer in Europe. The Fiskeby Acquisition provided us with the opportunity to further diversify and consolidate
our position in Northern and Central Europe, enhancing our multi-mill approach, strengthening our ESG profile,
while improving the overall quality of our offering and granting us direct access to brand owners providing volumes
visibility and opportunities to accelerate plastic substitution.

**_Actively integrate our recent acquisitions to extract commercial and cost synergies and operate with a_**

**_culture of continuous improvement to perpetually strengthen our operating efficiencies and streamline our cost_**
**_structure._**

We have identified several synergy opportunities that we are actively pursuing as the process of integrating

Fiskeby progresses. We have also identified various cost savings initiatives that we conservatively believe will
provide us with potential annual gross cost savings of over €36.6 million in aggregate by the end of 2028 (noting
that we have identified additional areas of upside for further cost savings). These initiatives include (but are not
limited to):

    - **_Plant initiatives:_** plant-level operational efficiencies from machinery upgrades / new equipment to
decrease variable costs (e.g., waste, which we believe could yield gross cost savings of approximately
€12.8 million per year once fully implemented);

    - **_Energy opportunities: investment in new co-generation plant and other equipment to reduce energy_**
costs (which we believe could yield gross cost savings of approximately €14.7 million per year once
fully implemented);

    - **_“ExcellenceOne” Program: a program composed of several initiatives such as lean manufacturing_**
philosophy roll-out, process analytics, maintenance, quality integration, procurement / pricing and

15


-----

supply chain saving through digitalization (which we believe could yield gross cost savings of
approximately €1.2 million per year once fully implemented); and

    - **_Fiskeby Integration: alignment of the performance of the overall equipment effectiveness to the Group_**
one, together with price repositioning, cross selling potential and procurement synergies (which we
believe could yield additional EBITDA impact of €8.0 million).

**_Leverage Fiskeby attractive product offering to expand geographical reach and increase customer base_**

We believe that the Fiskeby acquisition has been highly strategic and will provide us with the opportunity

to (i) grow our market share in the recycled board market and become the largest independent non-integrated
recycled board producer in Europe, (ii) enhance the security of our supply, (iii) expand in attractive markets such as
the United Kingdom, Baltics, Nordics and Poland, (iv) serve pan-European customers in a multi-mill reinforced
approach, (v) improve our cost structure with Fiskeby’s waste-to-energy plant that shelters the mill from any
volatility moves in the energy markets, (vi) use the higher technical performance of Fiskeby’s boards to compete
with producers of virgin fiber cartonboards, and (ix) reduce our carbon footprint, as the Fiskeby’s mill uses
alternative sources of energy.

**_Continue implementing our digitalization agenda to strengthen our “One Company” culture and_**

**_multi-mill concept._**

We believe our multi-mill concept and “One Company” culture provide us with tangible competitive

advantages, and we plan to scale up the impact of these key strengths by further implementing our digitalization
agenda. In addition, we believe our digitalization agenda will allow us to further develop and integrate our multi-mill
concept in our SB sector following the Eska Acquisition in order to continuously improve and enhance our product
offerings, competitive advantages and interchangeability with products produced in the various SB mills.

Our digitalization agenda is a comprehensive digital transformation program aimed at achieving

efficiencies through all areas of the Group, including projects on operations, logistics, procurement, human
resources, sales, planning and health and safety. As such, we strive to further expand and improve our product and
service offerings, as well as our manufacturing and service processes. We view digital improvement as a key strategy
to improve our efficiency, innovation and coordination across our operations.

Through sophisticated digital applications, we are focused on continuing to deliver high-quality and

innovative products across the entire value chain and circular economy in which we operate, with a clear strategy
of continuously strengthening our operational efficiency and excellence through lean manufacturing plans and
initiatives.

**_Continue developing new, innovative products to answer the needs of our customers_**

We believe that product innovation is a key pillar of our strategy and we are focused on further improving

our product offering in order to answer the needs of our clients, be on top of secular trends and capitalize on new
opportunities and unlock additional growth. In this respect, we have identified certain strategic themes which are
the key focus areas of our product innovation:

    - _Plastic to paper substitution: working on greater usage of papers for food applications and barriers for_
grease, water and oxygen;

    - _Digitalization experience: working on WLC and SB designed for e-commerce;_

    - _Environmental: working on alternative sources for fibers; and_

    - _Premium: working on creation of bi-color boards and premium materials._

**_Maintain our sustainability leadership and our focus on achieving our long-term sustainability goals._**

Sustainability is central to our business model and our management team. We are proud of our role in the

circular economy and our ability to grow the sustainability of our business alongside financial performance. To
continue to drive this forward, we have identified clear, quantifiable long-term sustainability goals for 2025 and
2030. These goals include the following:

    - _Climate Change: By 2030, our goal is to have reduced GHG Emissions by 30% (emissions in 2020_
equaled 0.495 tCO2 emissions per ton);

    - _Waste Reduction and Recovery:_ By 2030, our goal is to have reduced the total amount of waste
generated per ton of net saleable product by 18% (total waste per ton of net saleable product in 2020
was 181 kilograms per ton) and have increased the proportion of waste sent for recovery to 90%
(proportion of waste recovered in 2020 was 73%);

    - _Water: By 2030, our goal is to have reduced wastewater discharge per ton of net saleable product by_
20% (wastewater discharge per ton of net saleable product in 2020 was 11.06 cubic meters per ton);

    - _Employee Wellbeing: By 2030, our goal is to have increased the employee advocacy rate to 4.5 (the_
employee advocacy rate in 2020 was 3.98);

    - _Diversity: By 2030, our goal is to have increased the percentage of female employees by 30% (in 2020,_
9.5% of our employees were women); and

    - _Responsible Sourcing of Materials: By 2025, our goal is to have implemented a new program to assess_
and qualify all of our key suppliers for all relevant product categories according to ESG criteria.

Additionally, this Offering is sustainability-linked, with a Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework.

Our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework includes Sustainability Performance Targets for the most material
indicators for our business for 2025. These are:

      - _Climate Change: By the end of 2025, our goal is to have reduced GHG Emissions by 15% (from_
the 2020 baseline of 0.495 tCO2e/ton);

      - Waste: By the end of 2025, our goal is to have increased the proportion of waste sent for recovery
to 86.2% (from the 2020 baseline of 72.8%); and

      - _Water:_ By the end of 2025, our goal is to have reduced wastewater discharge per ton of net
saleable product by 16.6% (from the 2020 baseline of 11.06 m3/ton).

**_Pursue disciplined investments in key focus areas._**

We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize and to grow our asset base, with a focus on

disciplined investments that we believe will strengthen our pan-European presence and support the achievement of
our strategic goals. In addition, we will also continue to explore means to strengthen and to extract greater value
from our existing operations, which may include investments in other related sectors within the circular economy
or along the circular economy value chain in which we operate. For further detail, see also “Business—Our
_Production Process—Circular Business Model.” We believe we have a well-invested asset base today and have a_
history of investing our capital responsibly and with a strong return on investment, and have proven our ability to

**Recent Developments**

**_Closure of the Blendecques mill_**

Our Blendecques mill was shut down from March 22, 2022 as a result of a fire that occurred due to causes

outside our control. Although the fire materially impacted various areas of the plant, causing operations to cease, no
one was injured or killed. While we invested in the reconstruction of the mill over the course of 2023 via insurance
proceeds received from our insurers, in order to address the continued underperformance of the Blendecques mill,
we are currently considering strategic alternatives and currently intend to cease operations at the Blendecques mill
by the second half of 2024. We believe the closure of this mill will improve our profitability, optimize our industrial
footprint and allow us to more efficiently adapt our current mill capacity to temporary changes in demand dynamics
for cartonboard, that resulted in mitigating pricing pressures in 2023.

We estimate that we will incur approximately €20 million of one-off costs in connection with the closure

of the mill, which we believe that we will recover by 2025 by selling related assets and utilizing our more profitable
mills to take over production which previously would have been produced at the Blendecques mill. In the long-term,
we believe that the closure of the Blendecques mill will have a positive impact on our results of operations and
Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In particular, we expect that in the long-term the closure of the Blendecques
will result in an annual positive impact on our Adjusted EBITDA of between approximately €5 million and
approximately €10 million.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Blendecques mill generated revenues of €9.3 million

and an EBITDA loss of €14.7 million. The results of operations from the Blendecques mill will be classified as
discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements starting from January 1, 2024. To enhance
comparability across period, in this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial metrics as if Blendecques
was classified as discontinued operations and was excluded from the Group’s consolidation perimeter as of January
1, 2023.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The cyclical nature of our industry may

_result in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of operations,”_ “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Industry—Any significant damage to one of our mills could cause a production disruption”_ and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting
_Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Blendecques and Villa Santa Lucia mills.”_

-----

**_Re-opening of the Villa Santa Lucia mill_**

Following the standstill of the Villa Santa Lucia plant from August 2022 to December 2022 and then from

July 2023 to March 2024, due to the unforeseen overhaul of the area’s municipal effluent treatment plant in 2022
and the local Italian court decision to revisit the case and further review its operations in 2023, our management
collaborated with authorities extensively to show there were no further issues and we were able resume operations
at Villa Santa Lucia on March 4, 2024.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Any significant damage to one of our

_mills could cause a production disruption” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition_
_and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_
_Blendecques and Villa Santa Lucia mills.”_

**_The Revolving Credit Facility_**

In connection with the Offering and to further support our liquidity, on March 21, 2024, we entered into

the new Revolving Credit Facility, which provides borrowings of €100 million and will mature on the date falling
six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be cancelled on
the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement.”_

**_Order Intake Update_**

Based on preliminary estimates, in the two months ended February 29, 2024, the Group’s order intake in

its white lined chipboard (WLC) market segment increased by 46% compared to the same period of 2023 (excluding
the operations of the Villa Santa Lucia mill as it was closed in January and February 2024). Additionally, RDM had
announced WLC price increase of €60 per ton from March 1, 2024. Demand for RDM board remains strong even
after the Group communicated the price increase. Competitors have followed suit and communicated pricing
increases in line with RDM strategy.

**_Performance Update_**

In the first two months of 2024, we have observed (i) volumes increasing, (ii) prices increasing, (iii) costs

generally stabilizing, and (iv) the continued realization of costs savings, in each case compared to the three months
ended December 31, 2023.

We believe that the re-start of the Villa Santa Lucia mill and the expected closure of the Blendecques mill

will both positively impact EBITDA.

Based on the observed year-to-date trends and planned actions, if such trends continue throughout the year

and volumes increase as expected, we believe that Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA for the year ending
December 31, 2024 will be an improvement compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

_The above forward-looking statements have been prepared by management based on preliminary internal_

_management accounts and operational records and is based on, among other things, certain assumptions_
_concerning future events that management expects to occur and the actions management intends to take. Such events_
_and actions may not actually be realized, as they depend substantially on variables that management cannot control_
_and may involve situations that management cannot predict, which could cause our actual results to differ materially_
_from our expectation and from past results, performance or achievements. Therefore, the guidance information_
_presented above is subject to significant uncertainties, including, changes in the macroeconomic conditions, market_
_conditions and regulatory framework, and the Group’s actual results or performance may differ materially from_
_those projected or implied in the guidance. Accordingly, the guidance information presented above should not be_
_taken as an indication of future performance, and should not be viewed as a substitute for the full results for the_
_year ending December 31, 2024, which will be prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by our independent_
_auditors. In addition, the above forward-looking statements have not been audited, reviewed, verified or subject to_

_accordingly, our independent auditors do not express an opinion or provide any form of assurance with respect_
_thereto for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum._

_In light of the foregoing, prospective purchasers of the Notes are strongly cautioned not to place undue_

_reliance on the above guidance information, and such guidance should not be regarded as an accurate prediction_
_of actual financial results. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”_

**Use of Proceeds ..................................** We expect the gross proceeds from the Offering will be approximately €590
million. Proceeds from the Offering, will be used, directly or indirectly, to
(i) redeem the Existing Notes and pay any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, (ii) repay amounts outstanding under and cancel the Fiskeby
Acquisition Facility, including any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and
(iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. See “Use

**Optional Redemption ........................** Prior to, 2025 the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any
time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
redemption date and a “make-whole” premium, as described in this
Offering Memorandum under the caption “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption of the Notes.”_

Prior to, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate
principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of redemption.

At any time on or after, 2025 the Issuer may redeem all or a portion
of the Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to the date of redemption.

**Additional Amounts; Tax**

**Redemption ....................................** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect

of the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for any taxes
or other governmental charges, except to the extent required by law. If
withholding or deduction is required by law in any “Tax Jurisdiction”,
subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, will pay additional amounts so that the net amounts received by
the holders of Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any
such withholding or deduction from such additional amounts) will equal the
amounts which would have been received in the absence of such
withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts.” The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at_
any time, upon giving prior notice, if certain developments affect taxation.
If the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay holders
of such Notes a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes being redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

Subject to and as set out in “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts,” the Issuer, under certain circumstances, will not be liable to pay_
any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in relation to, among other
things, any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as the same may be amended,
or supplemented from time to time (the “Decree No. 239”) if the Notes are
held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list issued
under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, and otherwise in the
circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts.”_

26


-----

**Original Issue Discount .....................** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If the stated principal amount of the Notes
exceeds their “issue price” by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily
defined de minimis amount, the Notes will be treated as issued with OID
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, U.S.
Holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations”), whether on the cash or accrual method of tax_
accounting, would be required to include any amounts representing OID in
gross income (as ordinary income) on a constant yield to maturity basis for
U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of cash payments
to which such income is attributable. For further discussion, see “Certain
_Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**Change of Control ..............................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the
date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to the date of purchase. A change of control will not be deemed to
have occurred if a certain consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded as
a result of such event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”
and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of
_Control Event.”_

**Certain Covenants .............................** The Indenture governing the Notes will limit, among other things, our
ability to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred
stock;

                   - make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making other
distributions, making investments and prepaying or redeeming
subordinated indebtedness or equity;

**RISK FACTORS**

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_Our business is affected by global economic and/or political conditions and any deterioration in the_**

**_global economic and/or political situation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

Our mills and sheeting centers are located across Europe and in the United States and we sell our

products, either directly or indirectly, in over 100 countries worldwide. Therefore, our business is exposed to
general macroeconomic environment risks that are beyond our control, such as general macroeconomic
conditions, volatility in the global capital and credit markets (including in the European sovereign debt market),
geopolitical events and other general political and economic developments globally and in the markets in which
we operate. Demand for our products, which is primarily driven by demand for our customers’ end-products, such
as industrial and consumer packaging, closely follows global economic conditions. Sustained economic
downturns characterized by declines in consumer and government spending, business investment or construction
activity typically result in decreased demand for various forms of packaging which, in turn, could negatively
affect the demand for our products. Any changes to the central banks’ monetary policy positions or any turmoil
in the capital and credit markets could result in decreased availability of credit, which could have an adverse
effect on the global trade and economy consequently impacting markets for our products and our customers’ endproducts. Similarly, any restrictions on free trade, such as customs, import taxes or other forms of increased
protectionism or even forms of trade war, could adversely affect global trade and the global economy and
therefore have an adverse effect on our business operations.

Recent years have been challenging for the world economy, due in part to political turmoil and/or

upheaval in a number of regions, which has resulted in high currency volatility and tumultuous markets. Despite
an improvement in global economic conditions since 2021, following the sharp global economic downturn in
2020 resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum the
outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain, and certain markets, including Europe, may not achieve
the growth rates that they have forecasted or historically observed. Such uncertainty has been recently exacerbated
by the global turmoil resulting from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in severe
political, social and economic consequences in the countries directly involved in the conflict as well as more
broadly on the European continent, as tensions between Russia, the European Union, the United States, the United
Kingdom and other countries continue to increase and certain governments collapsed. Among other things, the
ongoing war in Ukraine has also been a driver behind a significant surge in energy and transportation prices in
2022, which have been, and may continue to be, a key factor in driving inflationary pressure and may ultimately
adversely affect general economic conditions and in turn our results of operations. The risk of further
intensification of the conflict in Ukraine remains high, and there is a potential risk of further escalation and a
spreading of the war to other regions. Although we do not have any mills, offices, sheeting centers, distribution
centers, or other facilities in Russia, and we do not sell our products in Russia, some of our customers’ endproducts might be sold in such market, which could indirectly expose us to Russia’s economic condition. In
addition, as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, some of our competitors had to stop exporting their products to
Russia and other markets impacted by such conflict, which led to an increase of competition in the European
markets, adding a downward pressure on the price of our products. We continue to closely monitor the ongoing
conflict and its impact on our operations. The extent and duration of the conflict, the implementation of further
sanctions and any related market disruptions are impossible to predict and we cannot be certain that they will
have a further impact on our operations. Separately, in early October 2023, Hamas and Israel began an armed
conflict which may potentially spread to surrounding Middle Eastern countries. Our revenues from sales in Israel,
Palestine and Lebanon do not represent a significant part of our overall sales revenues and we have not faced
direct consequences of the local conflict on our sales or exports and/or imports. However, to a limited extent,
their escalation may still impact on our business due to increased logistic costs resulting from the spillover effects
of the conflict on transportation infrastructures and trade routes. For example, following the beginning of the
hostilities PfR exports from Europe to Asia decreased. The length, outcome and consequences of the HamasIsrael military conflict remain highly unpredictable, and we cannot exclude that, it will further negatively impact

43


-----

international trade and our supply chains. The tensions arising from the conflict in Ukraine coupled with a
potential escalation of the ongoing military confrontation between Israel and Hamas (and its spillover effects
throughout the Middle East, including the impact on shipping through the Red Sea) could also further increase
other political tensions and hamper international trade. Any energy and logistics issues, further political and
economic instability and escalating geopolitical tensions in Europe or globally could have a material adverse
effect on the demand for our products, business and results of operations.

According to Eurostat, the European Commission statistical agency, the real gross domestic product

(“GDP”) growth rate in the Eurozone countries that have adopted euro (“Participating Member States”) signals
increased volatility. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, GDP growth rate decreased by 6.1% in 2020, and
subsequently started growing at a decreasing year-to-year rate of 5.9% and 3.4% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
The decreasing growth rate correlates with the described instability in the global economy. Simultaneously, there
are considerable divergences between GDP growth among the constituents of the Participating Member States.
Concerns over inflation, unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, sovereign debt and the instability of
euro have contributed to increased volatility in recent years and diminished expectations for the economies of the
Participating Member States going forward. A significant portion of our revenue is generated in the Participating
Member States as is a significant portion of our production, sourcing and financing activities. The effects on the
European and global economy of any exit of one or more constituents of the Participating Member States from
the economic and monetary union, the dissolution of euro and the possible redenomination of financial
instruments or other contractual obligations from euro into a different currency, or the perception that any of these
events are imminent, are inherently difficult to predict and could give rise to operational disruptions or other risks
to our business, including our financing activities, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Prevailing market interest rates, overall inflation levels and energy and logistics costs may result in

supply chain disruptions and impact our operations and their results. In particular, the material increases in global
inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and expectations that annual
inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and
the resulting impact on energy markets) has forced central banks of the major world economies, including the
U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, to significantly increase market interest rates in a very short
timeframe, ending the lengthy period of low interest rates. As global inflation levels and interest rates continue to
remain high, economic growth may be negatively impacted, which in turn may adversely affect our business,
operations and financial performance, including by reducing our ability to fund organic growth through capital
expenditures and by increasing the cost of obtaining financing. In addition, China’s property market currently
faces stressful events (including, for example, the Evergrande group commencement of Chapter 15 proceedings
in the United States in August 2023 and the imposition of a forced liquidation in China in January 2024) which
may lead to a widespread crisis of the entire real estate and financial sectors, with systemic implications which
are currently difficult to predict. These factors have also led to a decline in consumer and business confidence
that is negatively impacting the post-pandemic recovery. It is possible that higher prices will push the industrial
sector and the EU economy into a recession over the short to medium term. These conditions also materially
increase the risk of a stagflation scenario taking hold.

Partly as a result of the ongoing interest rate surge in 2023, the banking sector experienced significant

pressures, which led to the collapse of certain U.S. regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023,
requiring an immediate governmental intervention, which was followed by the shutdown of Signature Bank, the
takeover of First Republic Bank by JP Morgan Chase in May 2023, and the merger of Credit Suisse into UBS in
June 2023 as a result of the downfall in Credit Suisse’s share price earlier that year. In the event of failure or
financial distress of any of our lenders or financial counterparties, we may be unable to access deposits or undrawn
amounts under our facilities in a timely fashion or at all, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and
ability to fund our ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Similarly, if any of our
customers were unable to access their funds with their lenders or financial counterparties, their ability to pay their
obligations to us or to enter into new arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be materially
adversely affected. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result
in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and

44


-----

operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, which could make it more
difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to
our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating
expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations or result in breaches of our financial and/or
contractual obligations.

Any of the foregoing events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on

our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our business depends on the continued and uninterrupted supply of raw materials used in our_**

**_products. If we are unable to secure sufficient quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials rises,_**
**_it could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers’ demands and materially adversely affect our_**
**_financial results._**

The main raw material required in the manufacture of our products, such as cartonboard in our WLC

segment or solidboard in our SB sector, is PfR. We source recycled paper from local industries and commercial
companies as well as local municipal paper collections, mostly in the form of fiber-based packaging and
magazines. Our production levels could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers are unable or
unwilling to supply us with raw materials at anticipated levels, but we are ready to cope with potential fluctuations
in the supplied volumes by differentiating the sources among different countries and suppliers. While we would
seek to find alternative sources of raw materials in the event of a significant interruption or limitation in the supply
of these production inputs from our current suppliers, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so in
a timely and cost-efficient manner. Any economic slowdown could also lead to decreased capacity at our suppliers
or supplies existing the market. As a result, should the demand for our products increase faster than anticipated,
there may not be sufficient volume of raw materials to meet the increased needs, or the price of these inputs may
increase. This could result in production delays and an increase in costs, and, if such delays are prolonged or cost
increases are substantial, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Several factors could affect the short- and long-term supply and price of raw materials in the regions in

which we operate, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, restrictions on international trade, and
supply chain and delivery disruptions (including labor disputes) at our suppliers, which may lead to the decrease
of quality and availability of recycled paper as a result of the temporary closure of some sectors or lack of labor
in the wastepaper collection chain. Additionally, other companies, whether or not in our industry, could seek to
purchase the same raw materials from our procurement areas and adversely change regional market dynamics,
resulting in insufficient quantities of raw material and price increases. For example, the price of wastepaper (from
which recycled fiber is made) has been highly volatile during recent years. Historically, the volatility of the prices
for recycling paper generates a direct impact in the recycled board selling prices allowing the continuity of the
business profitability, even with some time lags. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced a fiber
shortage due to reductions in collection rates. We have experienced shutdowns of recycling plants due to the
COVID-19 pandemic as well as reduced availability of input materials. Additionally, we may face shortages in
the white grade paper sector as a result of the decreasing consumption of fine paper due to the increasing switch
from paper-based media to digital ones. In case of such shortages, we would have to replace white grade papers
with coating chemicals at higher costs.

Furthermore, our business model is dependent upon a circular economy and our ability to source recycled

fibers. For further detail, see also “Business—Our Production Process—Circular Business Model.” For the year
ended December 31, 2023, 95% of the fibrous material we used was recycled and over 84% of all materials used
consisted of renewable materials. The prices of several recycled fibers that we use are historically volatile. For
example, we experienced a price surge of the average cost per ton of recycled fibers from €247/ton in July 2021
to €325/ton in July 2022. This has since fallen to €242/ton as of December 31, 2023. Also, the supply and quality
of the recycled materials can vary since a portion of our recycled input materials are sourced from mixed waste.

45


-----

Shortages of the raw materials used in our production and the associated increases in prices have led to

a significant rise in our operating costs in the past. While we have reduced our exposure to such shortages,
particularly in Sweden, where we secured most of the necessary raw materials following completion of the
Fiskeby Acquisition, any increase in our operating costs as a result of such shortages could impact our ability to
meet our customers’ demand. In addition, we have improved our ability to pass through input costs to our
customers by implementing price increases at the time of delivery as opposed to the time of order. However, if
we are unable to increase our product prices sufficiently to maintain our margins when the prices of raw materials
increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_It is difficult for us to accurately forecast our production requirements, and we may be unable to_**

**_effectively manage our own inventory._**

While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are typically not contractually

committed to buying any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Many of our customers may also
increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. Although our
pricing methodology allows us to increase prices at the time of delivery, the short-term nature of commitments
by most of our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduces our
ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. As a result, even though we aim to gain visibility
over the purchasing requirements of our customers and end users, it can be difficult for us to accurately align our
production levels to our customers’ actual needs. If the estimates of our customers’ production needs turn out to
be inaccurate, there could be a mismatch between our supply output and our customers’ demand, which might be
significant. In addition, if our customers perceive that the price of our products may increase, namely as a result
of inflationary trends or bottlenecks in the supply chain, they could decide to purchase more of our products than
usual, which might result in them holding excess amounts of our products in their inventory as compared to their
actual production requirements. This, in turn, may cause a contraction in our customers’ demand for our products
in future periods for so long as their inventory levels do not decrease to usual levels, which may have a negative
impact on our sales volumes and revenues for such periods.

Starting in 2022, as part of an industry-wide phenomenon affecting our entire value chain, we have

experienced significant stocking and de-stocking dynamics, which resulted in a divergence of patterns between
consumption by our customers, on the one hand, and supply dynamics in our product end-markets, on the other
hand. In particular, in 2021 and in the first half of 2022, we experienced increased stocking by many of our
customers, which was primarily driven by their need to secure higher levels of inventories to meet expected
market demand and address supply chain uncertainty caused by macroeconomic concerns, such as supply chain
disruptions related to COVID-19 and other factors and heightened international tensions due to the conflict in
Ukraine. Such stocking dynamics drove an increase in the demand for our products during 2022. Conversely, in
2023, we experienced a decrease in the sale of our products, primarily as a result of a reduction in purchase
volumes by some of our customers who implemented de-stocking policies. Such customers started reviewing
their inventory management policies and decreased the level of our products held in stock as they prepared for a
generally improved macroeconomic environment in 2023 and as a result of a decrease in sales of their products
in certain end-markets, which was driven by several macroeconomic factors, including a persisting inflationary
environment, a material increases in global interest rates and general softness of private consumption with endcustomers showing recessionary behaviors. This, in turn, drove a contraction in our sales volumes, which
decreased by 34.7% in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. While we believe the de-stocking
trends that we experienced in 2023 have been largely driven by temporary contingencies and are not a recurring
trend in our industry, any such fluctuations may persist longer than we expect or may reoccur in the near future,
particularly where periods of significant increase in demand for end-products are followed closely by periods of
elevated costs of capital, unstable macroeconomic conditions and persisting inflation, which could negatively
impact our sales volumes and results of operations and increased capacity from manufacturers in Europe and
Turkey.

46


-----

**_The cyclical nature of our industry may result in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of_**

**_operations._**

We principally generate revenue through the sale of WLC and SB, used for the production of folding

cartonboard packaging, the lining of corrugated cardboard packaging and SB packaging from recycled fibers. Our
mills primarily sell the cartonboard we produce to our third-party customers in the packaging industry. Our
operating results are therefore impacted by the packaging industry’s historical cyclical pattern, with periods of
overcapacity and resulting pressure on pricing of packaging products such as corrugated containers and, in turn,
their component materials such as containerboard and corrugated board. This cyclicality results, in part, from
imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand, containerboard production capacity cannot
be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions, due to the high capital intensity of facilities such as
cartonboard mills (which generally continue production as long as fiber prices are sufficient to cover their
marginal costs), the long lead time between the planning and completion of new cartonboard mills and the fact
that new additions of cartonboard capacity tend to be large relative to the overall demand for the product. On the
other hand, significant cartonboard price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has
exceeded demand. In addition, there is the potential to convert graphic and newsprint paper machines into
containerboard machines which has happened recently both in Europe and the United States, and which may
contribute to overcapacity. Consequently, the cartonboard industry has experienced periods of substantial
overcapacity from time to time, such as in 2023 resulting mostly from a strong reduction of demand driven by the
de-stocking of previous years’ capacities, and rising inflation, which led to reduced end-user consumption,
coupled with increased capacity from manufacturers in Europe and Turkey. We expect periods of overcapacity
may occur again in the future. To the extent such overcapacity affects the European market, it would likely result
in a negative impact on prices in general, including the prices we are able to charge customers for our products.
In the absence of sufficient economic growth to generate increased demand or the inability to close production
facilities (either temporarily or permanently) to mitigate the effect of overcapacity, the addition of new capacity
can cause a period of regional overcapacity, which may lead to downward pricing and margin pressure. In periods
of overcapacity, industry participants may stop operating certain of their production facilities periodically to
reduce inventory levels. In the past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to reduced demand by taking
downtime and by rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity. In the event that the industry as a whole does
not take sufficient downtime or other measures to reduce capacity during any periods of overcapacity, this could
have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. For example, we
may decide to halt production (either temporarily or permanently) at our production facilities, and/or dispose of
one or more of our mills in the future to mitigate any negative effects of overcapacity in our industry on our results
of operations.

Overcapacity in the European cartonboard market could be further exacerbated by an increase of imports

from other regions and a related entrance of foreign producers in European markets, or a decrease of exports by
European producers to other regions, as a result of a variety of factors. For example, between 2021 and 2022,
high price levels and long lead times allowed new external producers to enter the European market. In addition,
in the event that producers in other regions experience overcapacity within their own local and regional markets,
they may seek to increase their level of exports to Europe and do so at lower pricing levels. Similarly, Chinese
producers were exporting their products to the United States and South America between 2021 and 2022. In such
an open international environment, we cannot be certain that this external pressure will not occur again in the
future and negatively impact our selling prices and profitability. In addition, the level of exports of cartonboard
from or to Europe also depends on relevant freight rates and currency rates. A strong euro, for example, can have
a negative effect on U.S. dollar-denominated exports by European cartonboard manufacturers with a negative
effect on the supply and demand balance for our business and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard
in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also been correlated to lower
sales by other European manufacturers who ship products in cartonboard packaging, resulting in lower European
demand for cartonboard packaging, and therefore for our cartonboard. See also _“—We sell our products in a_
_number of countries and are consequently exposed to currency fluctuations.”_

**_An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of energy could have a material_**

**_adverse effect on our results of operations._**

The production processes at our mills use a substantial amount of heat and electricity (mainly self
produced using natural gas, from natural gas fuel in combined heat and power plants). As result, energy is one of
the key components of our production costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, energy costs represented
21.5% of our total cost of raw materials and services (as compared to 29.0% in 2022).

Historically, in circumstances where we have been exposed to input volatility, we have protected our

margins by entering into long-term fixed price contracts to hedge exposure and by passing through increases in
input costs to customers. In the past, when prices for the materials we use in production have increased, we have
generally been successful in renegotiating prices with our customers within two months of the increase in input
costs. In addition, we have recently improved our ability to pass through input costs to our customers by
implementing price increases at the time of delivery as opposed to the time of order, which reduces the time
discrepancy between the increases in raw material prices and the selling prices of our products. For example, we
have recently announced a price increase in the WLC market segment effective from March 2024. Some of our
competitors might be able to adopt a more customer-friendly approach in reacting to the increases in input prices
and/or keep lower price levels resulting in our customers preferring our competitors’ products to ours, which
might result in the loss of customers.

In the months preceding the conflict in Ukraine, energy prices in Europe started increasing, with a

significant surge following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reaching their historical peak in August 2022. As a
result, our energy costs increased from €141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €271.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022. Although energy prices, and in particular the price of natural gas, have
generally decreased back to the pre-war levels during 2023, and our energy costs decreased to €125.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2023, they continue to be potentially very volatile and the potential of surging prices
or a gas shortage as a result of similar shock events in the future remains a possibility as macroeconomic tensions
persist in Ukraine and the Middle East. Any future increase in energy prices that we cannot immediately pass on
to our customers might have a negative impact on our cash flow. In addition, even if we are able to pass the
increased costs to our customers, it is possible that consumers using end-products made from WLC or SB will
also have to limit their spending, which in turn might negatively impact the demand for our products and our
results operations.

In general, while our mills have high self-sufficiency of electricity, which makes us less dependent on

purchased power at the moment, there can be no assurance that in the future we would not need to increase our
dependence on external energy suppliers following electrification and decarbonization programs. In this case,
any fluctuation in price and supply of electricity could have a material adverse effect on our business and
profitability. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher
production costs. A significant increase in the price of natural gas or an extended interruption in the supply of
natural gas to our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

**_Our business may be affected by macroeconomic conditions and political uncertainty in Italy._**

Macroeconomic conditions, market trends and customer demand in the countries where we operate may

impact our results. Given that the majority of the Group entities are established in Italy, representing
approximately 47% of our EBITDA, political uncertainty in Italy has a significant impact on our results of
operations. Economic growth in Italy since 2021 has been volatile. Real GDP growth was positive 6.6%, positive
4.0% and positive 0.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. As of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, the rating assigned by Fitch to Italy is BBB, with a stable outlook; the rating assigned
to Italy by Moody’s is Baa3, with a stable outlook; and the rating assigned to Italy by S&P Global Ratings is
BBB/A-2, with a stable outlook. These ratings could be lowered should there be a deterioration of the economic
and political fundamentals in Italy on which the outlooks are based.

48


-----

Any potential political instability in Italy may make conducting our business more challenging.

Following the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi in July 2022, early general elections took place in
September 2022 and a new center-right coalition government was appointed on the back of a parliamentary
majority. As future political events are difficult to predict, there can be no assurance of the duration of the new
government or that there may not be further political instability, including snap elections, or politically motivated
protests or strikes that may affect the Italian economy and our business negatively. In addition, the current
government may take positions that further exacerbate economic uncertainty in Italy, which may lead to lower
prices and profitability levels and have other material impacts on our business. If the current government acts
takes positions or actions adverse to our industry or the Italian economy in general, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry and measures taken by national governments or the EU_**

**_may distort competition in the industry._**

Today the cartonboard packaging industry competes with the plastic and reusable transit packs industry,

especially in certain markets such as packaging for direct food contact applications. Even though there are
industry-wide pressures, such as a gradual switch from plastic packaging to cartonboard packaging in the beverage
packaging industry, and targets prescribed by European Union legislation to substitute plastics with more
sustainable materials, there can be no assurance that such targets will be implemented and/or achieved by all of
the countries where we operate, and it is possible that the manufacturers of plastic and reusable transit packs will
expand their presence even in the markets in which we currently operate and may occupy a significant position
in such markets. This could be due both to our potential inability to keep pace with innovation, product
development and cost, as well as to the general ability of the cartonboard market to respond to changing market
requirements.

The cartonboard production industry in which we operate is mature, capital intensive and highly

competitive. We compete with several large multinational manufacturers, but also with numerous regional and/or
specialized manufacturers in the market for our products. Since 2021, we expanded and consolidated our
European leadership position through several acquisitions and are currently working on their integration into our
operations. However, there can be no assurance that in the future our competitors would not achieve greater
market presence and/or obtain more financial and other resources than us, which would allow them to make
investments in manufacturing facilities and/or product development at levels at which we may not be able to
compete. Furthermore, some of our competitors may be able to adjust their product prices more effectively in
response to input price changes. The competitive environment and imbalances between supply and demand of
raw materials have been principal factors behind fluctuations in product prices in recent years. In addition, we are
subject to the risk that local competitors following lower social responsibility standards could enter the market
with lower compliance, labor and other costs than ours, and we may not be able to compete with such companies
for the most price-conscious customers. We may not be able to maintain our current price levels, or increase the
prices for our products, unless there is a strong demand for packaging products or a further decrease in production
capacity. Decreases in demand or unfavorable price levels for our products could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Moreover, competition in the cartonboard production industry may be distorted by measures taken by

national governments or the EU. For example, a number of national governments and the EU have taken measures
to support companies operating in these industries in response to an economic downturn or to support economic
development in particular regions. These measures may include direct support to build new production capacity
in an industry already characterized by overcapacity and indirect support through tax and other incentives that are
not available to all market participants. Such support measures may have a significant effect on the supply/demand
balance in the industry and, therefore, distort competition in the market. In addition, competition in the industry
may be distorted by regulatory measures that, for example, support specific energy sources or impose additional
taxes, charges or penalties for certain practices. Such regulatory measures may require us to make significant
additional investments or change our trade practices, which could have a significant adverse effect on our
profitability and on our ability to compete against companies that are not subject to the same requirements.

49


-----

As our business is concentrated in certain geographic regions and along certain product lines, increased

competition in those regions and production lines could lead to loss of market share, materially adversely affecting
our financial results. Any failure by us to compete successfully with other producers of cartonboard could result
in the loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and future prospects.

**_The standardized nature of our industry and competition within it may result in downward pressure_**

**_on pricing and, as a consequence, lower earnings._**

Cartonboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer, and this standardization has led to

intensified price competition. This, in turn, has led to lower product prices, which may reduce earnings and have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business has in the
past faced downward pricing pressure, including as a result of standardization in the markets in which we operate.
We are likely to continue to be exposed to such factors in the future. In circumstances where we are unable to
adjust our cost base or achieve economies of scale comparable to our competition in these markets, pricing
pressure may have a material adverse effect on our margins and the profitability of the relevant business and our
market share. For example, in 2023 the cartonboard industry faced downward pressure on prices as a result of
weaker demand after a period of sustained price increases between April 2021 and October 2022.

We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. The paper-based packaging industry is

characterized by a high level of price competition as well as other competitive factors, including innovation,
design, quality and service. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key
competitive factor, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Pricing
pressure may arise from, among other things, limited demand growth and existing overcapacity in the market in
question, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale and
create excess product supply, the ability of competitors to operate or open production facilities in countries where
production costs are lower than those in which we operate. This may have a material adverse effect on business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_New manufacturing and product technologies may affect our ability to compete successfully._**

Technology innovation in the cartonboard industry is typically slow and requires significant investments.

However, new technologies or novel processes may emerge, particularly in relation to energy production, and
existing technologies may be further developed in the cartonboard production industry, which could have a
significant impact on production methods and/or on product quality or offerings. Unexpected changes in
employed technologies or the development of novel processes that affect our operations and product range could
render the technologies we utilize or the products we produce obsolete or less competitive in the future.
Difficulties in assessing new technologies may impede us from implementing them in a timely manner and
competitive pressures may force us to implement these new technologies at a substantial cost. Any such
development could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Changes in consumer preferences and the regulatory environment may adversely affect our business._**

Our cartonboard is used by our customers to produce packaging products for a variety of end-markets.

As we are at the beginning of the supply chain, we are highly dependent on the trends and level of demand in the
end-markets in which our customers operate, including the food, pharmaceutical and hygiene, paper, packaging
and printed products, chemical, and industrial/manufacturing market segments, which are in turn affected by
general economic and geopolitical conditions. Therefore, changes in consumer preferences for specific types of
packaging may affect the demand for cartonboard, and demand for specific grades of cartonboard. Regulatory
changes also could affect consumer preferences, production requirements, availability and price of raw materials
(especially affecting recycling rates) and energy usage, which in turn could lead to increased production costs or
reduced demand for our products in general.

50


-----

Our ability to correctly anticipate changes in consumer preferences and changes in regulations, and to

meet the new requirements on a competitive and economic basis, will require innovation, continued capacity
management and structure development and will be crucial to successful positioning of our brand. There can be
no assurances that our product offering will be able to meet changes in consumer preferences in the future, and
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

**_Our revenue is highly dependent on the continuity of contracts with our customers. Loss of a number_**

**_of customers and/or failure to diversify geographically could have an adverse impact on our business._**

We currently benefit from low customer concentration and high customer appreciation. As of December

31, 2023, we had over 2,500 customers, principally from the converting and printing industry, with our top 10
and top 100 customers accounting for 22% and 64% of our sales, respectively. The contractual relationship
between us and our clients is rarely governed by written framework agreements. Rather, most of our clients place
single purchase orders on a recurrent basis, for the on-going business relationship, consistently with the market
practice in the field in which we operate. A loss of our most significant customers, if not replaced on similar
terms, could have a material adverse effect on our future prospects.

Many of our top customers, based on revenue, are located in Europe. If we are unable to successfully

enter new markets outside Europe and reach a geographically more diversified group of customers, our business
will continue to be highly dependent on demand for our products in Europe. If our customers are unable to stay
competitive to meet their obligations under the contracts they entered into with us, our operating results and cash
flows may be negatively affected and we may be forced to renegotiate the existing contract on terms that are less
favorable and/or at reduced volumes in order to preserve our relationships with our customers. Our customers
may also decide not to renew contracts with us and/or issue additional purchase orders on the existing terms, or
at all, as they may find new cartonboard providers with more competitive pricing. Some of our customers could
also exit their current business or be acquired by other companies that purchase cartonboard from other providers.
If we are unable to maintain our existing customer contracts or to expand into new geographical areas, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_If our customers experience deterioration in their creditworthiness, this may have a material adverse_**

**_effect on our operations and financial results._**

Credit risk is the exposure of our business to the insolvency of our customers. As our business operations

are mainly concentrated in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden and our customers also
come from those countries, we face exposure with respect to their ability to pay on time. Some of our customers
operate in European regions that are historically characterized by prolonged payment terms resulting in significant
exposure to the risk that customers will default on their payment obligations to us. As a result of the impact of the
recent inflationary pressures, we cannot rule out that at least some of our counterparties could experience financial
difficulties, with potential adverse consequences, at least in the short-term, relating to payment times and credit
ratings.

While we have implemented certain credit procedures and policies in our contracts that aim to limit our

exposure to consumer credit risk (such as insurance agreements entered into with a leading credit insurance
company and various agreements entered into for the non-recourse assignment of receivables, particularly for
Italian customers), these protectionary measures may be insufficient to guard against the risk of loss resulting
from delayed payments, nonpayment or nonperformance by our contract counterparties. If the creditworthiness
of our customers deteriorates unexpectedly, they may not be able to pay for the products they order on time, or
not at all, or may not be able to otherwise perform under their contractual obligations, which could have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations, business, prospects and financial condition.

**_Our business may be adversely affected if our third-party sales agents fail to satisfactorily perform_**

**_and comply with our business practices and standards._**

We have ten sales offices spread across nine European countries for the WLC segment and four sales

offices in three European countries, and one outside Europe, for the SLB segment, some of which also sell our
products to neighboring countries. While most of our sales are directly managed by our employees from the sales
offices, in order to penetrate geographic areas that are not physically close to our sales offices, we employ a
limited number of third-party sales agents that report to our relevant sales offices. We expect to continue to rely
on these third-party sale agents to generate a portion of our sales in the future while we work to grow our direct
sales force. The impairment or termination of our relationships with the third-party sales agents for any reason,
or the failure of these parties to diligently sell our products and comply with applicable laws and regulations,
could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and profits.

We generally have direct relationship with our clients. We have full control of our customer portfolio

and directly invoice customers, while our third-party sales agents mainly act as a point of contact in relation to
our products and are rarely involved in the purchase order finalization between us and a customer. However, we
may be liable in the event of breaches of legal and regulatory obligations, including consumer protection laws
and obligations, by the third-party sales agents. While our success is partially dependent on the willingness and
ability of our third-party sales agents to diligently sell our products, we cannot guarantee that they will be
successful in marketing our products. Actions by third-party sales agents are beyond our control and could result
in poor representation of our products leading to flat or declining sales in that territory, harm to the reputation of
our company or our products or result in legal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the risk of losing customers, the terms of
local laws and our agreements with our third-party sales agents could make it difficult for us to replace a sales
agent we feel is underperforming.

If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy and our third-party

sales agents do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of
business. Additionally, our ability to receive services from the third-party sales agents may be impacted by
cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability
to conduct our business may be adversely affected. This risk might increase due to increased reliance on, and use
of, the third-party sales agents in the future.

**_Our business is highly dependent on reliable transportation systems for the distribution of our_**

**_products. As a result, any disruptions to transportation services and/or fluctuations in transportation costs_**
**_could adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

Our cartonboard production and product delivery processes require dependable and cost-effective

transportation systems and a strong distribution network. We mainly adopt an outsourcing model for our logistics
needs and are highly dependent on external service providers to ship our products. While we plan our need for
transportation services in advance, in particular, by keeping track of and analyzing the sales forecasts of the
market and holding internal integrated business planning meetings in order to balance our production capacity
based on the market needs, there can be no assurance that any disruptions to transportation services could not
temporarily impair our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner, potentially adversely
affecting our reputation and competitiveness. Any such disruption could arise as a result of shortages of, or
damage to, trucks and vessels, weather-related problems, accidents and mechanical difficulties, military conflicts
(including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and their spillover impact on transportation
infrastructures and trade routes, including on shipping through the Red Sea), strikes, restricted access to traditional
global shipping routes, transportation disruptions due to natural disasters or pandemics or other events. Any
potential increases in transportation costs due to rise in fuel prices or other national or global market conditions
could also adversely affect our business. As a result of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and recent
inflationary pressures, our transportation costs increased by €54 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€61 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2023. While we aim to mitigate these risks by entering into fixedprice shipping contracts where available in order to prevent our supply chain from being jeopardized, we still

52


-----

cannot guarantee that our transportation costs will not increase in the future. Accordingly, if the primary
transportation services we use to transport our products are disrupted, if we are unable to find alternative
transportation providers or if we are unable to pass increased transportation costs to our customers, it could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any
of these events may negatively impact our reputation, and, in certain circumstances, may constitute a force
majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying
for our products and may even lead to termination and non-renewal of our contracts.

**_Our operations may involve regulatory risks and we may incur significant costs in order to comply_**

**_with applicable laws and regulations._**

We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations enacted on both the global,

European and national levels, most of which are health and safety regulations, environmental regulations, labor
regulations, competition regulations, trade policies and corporate and tax laws. Potential impacts of changes in
the applicable regulatory frameworks could include higher costs and capital expenditure to meet new
environmental requirements, expropriation of assets, imposition of royalties or other taxes targeted at our industry,
and requirements for local ownership or beneficiation, all of which could have impact on our business and
investment activities. For instance, there is a wide variety of laws and regulations especially in the EU and in
certain EU Member States in relation to safety and inertness of all Food Contact Materials (“FCMs”). FCMs are
materials that may come in contact with edible products. The regulation aims to secure that materials do not, for
example, release their constituents into food at levels harmful to human health or change food composition, taste
and odor in an unacceptable way. Given that many of our products are used by customers operating in the food
and pharmaceutical packaging industry, any increased or amended regulation relating to FCMs could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant component of our operations, and

substantial resources are required to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and
to manage environmental risk. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, particularly
relating to wastewater discharges, air emissions, solid waste management and hazardous chemical disposal. These
laws and regulations, the violation of which can lead to substantial fines, injunctions or criminal penalties, have
generally become stricter in recent years and may in the future become more stringent. Further, our commitment
to ESG goals is public and it is part of our company identity. Thus, breaching environmental laws and regulations,
could have a material adverse effect on us not only for the economic impact of potential fines, injunctions or
criminal penalties, but also in terms of reputational damage. In addition, changes in regulations such as the EU’s
climate and environmental policy and increasing new requirements to limit carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and
sulfur oxides emissions may increase production, logistics and other costs and thereby have a negative impact on
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our_**

**_business and results of operations._**

Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including renewed waves of COVID-19 infections or

outbreaks of other diseases (such as Monkeypox, which was declared a public health emergency of international
concern by the World Health Organization in July 2022), may result in widespread health crises that could
adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries. This could, in turn, lead to substantial
declines in consumer purchasing power and result in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our
products, our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and our operating results. The worldwide
outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the consequent restrictive measures implemented by public authorities in the
affected countries in 2020 and 2021 had an enormous social impact and a significant impact on general economic
performance and on consumption and investments, leading to general uncertainty.

In response to COVID-19, many countries around the world, including where we manufacture and sell

our products, implemented a variety of measures to reduce the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions
and bans, social distancing required for both individuals and businesses, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders

53


-----

and required closures of non-essential businesses. These restrictions resulted, among other things, in significant
disruptions to business operations, supply chains and customer activity and demand, service cancellations or
reductions and other changes. While our facilities continued to operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,
social distancing measures and restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced
commercial and consumer activity in Italy and in the other markets in which we operate. During the COVID-19
pandemic, many of our customers were not able to operate their businesses as they would under normal
circumstances. As a result, while demand for our products in WLC and SB segments grew due to pressures in
grocery market related to increased demand for packaged foods, other segments of the global economy
deteriorated, and it was difficult to estimate inventory capacities of our customers.

Future communicable disease outbreaks may cause further disruption in our business operations and

cause delay or limit the ability of our customers and suppliers to perform under their existing contracts, including
making timely payments to us, and cause other unpredictable events. Customers may also experience significant
losses and may terminate their existing contracts or postpone or ultimately cancel future planned orders and
contracts due to those losses. Both domestic and international travel may be further restricted to certain areas
which may limit our ability to obtain new customers and enter new markets, to provide services in the areas in
which our customers are currently located or otherwise conduct our operations as we would do under normal
circumstances.

Additionally, there could be increases in costs should we have to implement enhanced health and safety

measures in our operations in line with public health rules and guidelines and industry practices to combat the
spread of a communicable disease (as we did during the COVID-19 pandemic). We are also exposed to the risk
of an increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to
implement such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a
result from any pandemic-related claims from workers or third-party customers and suppliers that may come into
contact with our operations. All or any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

There can be no assurance that any future outbreak of COVID-19 or another virus or contagious diseases

will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. To the extent
that a communicable disease outbreak adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and
prospects, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors”
section.

**_We are exposed to risk related to climate change._**

The cartonboard production process is energy intensive and contributes to GHG Emission, the main

cause of climate change. We have adopted energy management systems (ISO 50001) for several of our mills,
certified by accredited third-party bodies and are in a process of transition towards production processes and
energy sources with a lower environmental impact. We also use high efficiency co-generation plants and
increasingly cleaner fuels in our efforts to manage the risks of volatility in the purchase price of emission
allowances under the Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). While we have implemented a prevention program
aimed at reducing the impacts associated with the occurrence of natural disasters, the presence of our mills in
locations potentially subject to climate change events such as rising river flows and increased frequency and
intensity of storms and wildfires exposes us to potential risks of disruption to operations, which could have
adverse material impact on our business and profitability.

We may also become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance

with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators,
shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering
ways to reduce GHG Emissions. Various governmental and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed
legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions and energy policies.
We are committed to reduce our GHG Emissions by 30% by 2030, however if such legislation is enacted and if
it prescribes stricter emission reduction targets or other limitations, we could incur increased energy,

54


-----

environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the new or expanded limitations. Due to
the uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and
initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our operations.
Furthermore, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation
related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. Should any of these factors
materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
future prospects.

**_Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks that could compromise the security of our operational_**

**_systems and result in substantial harm to our business._**

The integrity, reliability and operational performance of our information technology (“IT”) systems are

important to our internal and external communications and day-to-day management of our operations. Further,
the efficient performance of our multi-mill concept highly depends on the regular and proper functioning of our
IT systems. In particular, we employ IT tools to coordinate production across our network of mills, aiming at
balancing the availability of our products across our network, at ensuring greater proximity between customers
and the mill that is manufacturing the products they consume and at increasing the comfort our customers can
take in the reliability of their supply chain. Our focus on coordination within the multi-mill network also allows
us to monitor and better respond to market volatility arising from rapid changes in local demand or changes in
production at individual mills. Our IT systems may be damaged or interrupted by increases in usage, human error,
damaged hardware, our suppliers’ failure to follow service level agreements, network connection issues, cyber
security issues, natural hazards or disasters or similarly disruptive events. Cybersecurity risks, in particular, have
a potentially significant effect on our business and are continuously monitored. The migration of IT infrastructures
to the cloud as well as the scale of cyber-attacks (the risk of which has been heightened by the ongoing conflict
in Ukraine), the nature of which is constantly changing, not only affect IT infrastructures and business operations
but can lead to possible breaches or theft of sensitive and personal data. As a result, our IT systems play an
important role in our operations, making the security of our sites and IT systems as well as cloud security and
protection against cybersecurity incidents crucial to the smooth running of our operations. Any IT failure
pertaining to availability, access or system security could potentially result in disruption of our core activities and
personnel, as well as of our key commercial strategy and business organization, including the multi-mill concept,
and could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial performance.

Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the

systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to unauthorized access to our systems, significant
service disruptions, a partial or complete shutdown of our mills for a short or extended period, corruption or
misappropriation of assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data or disruption of business
processes. Such attacks could occur for the purpose of sabotage and financial blackmail, to extract businesssensitive, confidential or personal information, or to cause corruption of information or disruption of business
processes. Our cybersecurity measures may not detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems. As
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known
until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to protect against these
attacks.

If we fail to identify security threats that could disrupt our business, or if our cyber risk insurance policies

would be insufficient, or if we are unable to avert future attacks or security breaches, we could be subject to
significant legal liability and exposure to financial losses. We may, for example, be subject to operational
disruptions, increased costs to identify and remediate vulnerabilities or reconstruct lost data, damage to reputation
and commercial relationships, ransom demand, claims from customers and suppliers, all of which could materially
impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Due to the complexity of the manufacturing process of our products, we regularly invest in the_**

**_maintenance of our facilities. We could incur unforeseen capital expenditure costs and complications which_**
**_could arise whenever when making investments in our operations which could adversely affect our business._**

In order to grow, remain competitive and to expand production capacity to meet anticipated market

demand in the cartonboard and SB markets, we need to continually make capital investments in new or our
existing operations. For example, over the last three years we have installed (i) a new boiler at the mill of Santa
Giustina, three new boilers at the mill of Hoogezand, including one e-boiler, which allows for a more efficient
production of steam for manufacturing, (ii) a new high-efficiency co-generation plant in Ovaro and (iii) a new
washing machine in our Barcelona mill that helps us to reduce waste and improve quality and energy efficiency.
We have also started building a new CHP plant in Barcelona to further reduce our GHG Emissions and achieve
cost savings, which we expect will be completed in the end of the second quarter of 2024. While these capital
investment projects are aimed at reducing our variable costs, increasing the capacity and efficiency and improving
the safety and quality of products, due to the complexity of the machinery we utilize, there can be no assurance
that they will be successful in achieving these goals. Moreover, we could encounter severe problems in the rampup and operations of new or existing production facilities or we could run into issues with securing access to
sufficient funding to fund necessary capital improvements in the future.

If our investments in our mills and machineries are not effectively undertaken and/or if we are not able

to raise sufficient funds for any required capital improvement projects, or if the additional production capacity is
not matched with corresponding increases in demand, such failures could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Any significant damage to one of our mills could cause a production disruption._**

The production at our mills could be adversely affected by extraordinary events, including data security

breaches, cyber security issues, fire, an explosion, the release of high-temperature steam or water, structural
collapse, machinery or data system failure, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, road
construction or closures of primary access routes, flooding, windstorms and/or other severe weather conditions.

For example, our Blendecques mill was shut down from March 22, 2022 as a result of a fire that occurred

due to causes outside our control. Although the fire materially impacted various areas of the plant, causing
operations to cease, no one was injured or killed. We estimated that the fire and the subsequent business
interruption led to a reduction in production volumes of approximately 22,000 tons in 2022 and approximately
60,000 tons in 2023, assuming the same demand level recorded at the other mills of the Group over the same
period. In February 2023, the Blendecques mill’s carton machine was partly restarted. In 2022, we received a
€3.1 million insurance reimbursement related to the fire and in 2023 we received €44.8 million of insurance
reimbursements. The Blendecques mill was fully operational in September 2023, but it was temporarily shut down
again due to flooding at the end of 2023 and as a result it was not able to ramp up operations as expected. In order
to address the continued underperformance of the Blendecques mill, we are currently considering strategic
alternatives and currently intend to cease operations at the Blendecques mill by the second half of 2024. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—Closure of the Blendecques mill.”

In addition, our Villa Santa Lucia plant was on standstill from August 2022 to December 2022 due to an

interruption in a municipal wastewater treatment. In July 2023, public authorities ordered the seizure of the
sewage treatment plant serving the paper mill in Villa Santa Lucia due to alleged environmental pollution.
Similarly to the first standstill, we cooperated with local authorities and we believe that we proved that our mill
did not commit any environmental malpractice towards the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Following
extensive discussions with local authorities, on March 4, 2024, the Villa Santa Lucia mill resumed operations,
although we have not yet received a new environmental authorization. We estimate that these events led to a
production decrease of approximately 30,000 tons in 2022 and 74,000 tons in 2023, assuming the same demand
level experienced in the other mills of the Group over the same period. See “Summary—Recent Developments—
_Re-opening of the Villa Santa Lucia mill.”_

**_Issues relating to our product safety and liability could interrupt our production operations and we_**

**_may be required to pay damages or other remedies as a result of product liability claims._**

Quality and safety of our products is critical to the success of our business. Our customers expect high

quality products, which underscores the importance of consistency and repeatability in production processes to
ensure customer satisfaction. Furthermore, certain of our products are used in the food industry, where key
customers have stringent requirements regarding the products they purchase. The consequences of quality or
safety issues, due to, for example, accidental or malicious raw material contamination, issues with the
management of large quantities of incoming paper or supply chain contamination caused by human error, sabotage
or equipment fault, could be severe. While we rely on internationally recognized chain-of-custody certification
schemes, such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or PEFC (Program for the Endorsement of Forest
Certification), and aim to detect potential quality issues and hazards as early as possible, detected faults or defects
in our products or in product descriptions discovered at a critical point in our production chain could interrupt
production in the unit concerned and disturb the entire mill’s operations. Any incidents involving toxic substances
could have severe consequences for human health. As such, any such disturbances or incidents could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in_**

**_significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our_**
**_customers._**

Maintaining high level of our personnel safety and security for our employees and wider workforce is

critical to our business and should never be compromised. We have adopted a “Zero Accident” policy and work
towards continuous improvement in injury rates. Our goal is to provide accident-free workplace by encouraging
a company-wide safety culture with everyone (including our contractors, suppliers and on-site visitors)
responsible for making every workday healthy and safe. At the same time, we recognize that our employees
frequently operate heavy machinery and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which could subject them
and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety
regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases,
criminal sanctions. For example, in 2023 there was a serious but non-fatal incident, in the tail threading at the
Blendecques mill. In addition, if our safety performance were to deteriorate, customers could decide to cancel our
contracts or not award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition
or results of operations.

**_We may not be able to successfully implement our cost reduction and efficiency improvement_**

**_measures._**

We have taken a number of measures to reduce our costs and achieve operating efficiencies over the past

years. The implemented measures have included the restructuring of our business areas and management and mill
divestments to address overcapacity and improve profitability. In addition, our management has identified a
number of initiatives to further strengthen our cost base and generate operational efficiencies, including through
the integration of Paprinsa, Eska and Fiskeby operations into our business and the deployment of investments to
pursue new energy opportunities. For example, since 2021, we have upgraded our machinery and installed new
equipment to decrease our variable cost from waste, built a co-generation plant in Ovaro, implemented headcount
efficiency initiatives at mills with higher staffing levels and integrated systems focused on price alignment and
portfolio optimization, value engineering and capacity increase.

Even though in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 we have realized a significant portion of

the cost savings and synergies that we had identified in November 2021 when the Existing Notes were issued, we
may not be able to realize the full intended benefits of these measures or any additional initiatives that we may
undertake the future on our expected timeline or at all. Actual cost savings may differ materially from original
estimates for a number of reasons. In addition, cost reduction measures are based on current conditions and do
not take into account future cost increases that may result from changes in the industry or our operations, including
the overall weaker business environment and any uncertainty in the global markets as a result of the ongoing

57


-----

military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, recent inflationary pressures or another upheaval impacting the
global economy. Moreover, our estimates of the potential cost savings associated with initiatives are inherently
uncertain, and our ability to implement these initiatives and realize the anticipated costs savings (or any cost
savings at all) depends on a number of factors, including factors beyond our control. Further, some of the measures
taken by us are irreversible and we may incur significant costs should we want to recommence certain terminated
operations in the future as a result of, for example, industry consolidation or unexpected changes in industry
trends. Any failure to successfully implement these or additional future measures, or the failure of these measures
to generate the anticipated level of savings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

**_We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA included_**

**_in this Offering Memorandum, and the unaudited Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA information and_**
**_other pro forma financial information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties._**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain run rate pro forma adjusted financial data which is

based on various assumptions. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Summary Financial and
_Other Information,” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information” for additional details_
regarding these run rate pro forma adjustments to Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and their underlying
assumptions. These assumptions are based on our current estimates, and they involve risks, uncertainties, further
assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such run rate
adjusted pro forma financial data. This Offering Memorandum presents unaudited Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma
EBITDA figures for the Group that result from certain assumptions and adjustments that we have made for (i) the
extraordinary income from the insurance reimbursement for the fire accident that occurred at our Blendecques
mill in March 2022, (ii) the estimated impact on our operations as if RDM Blendecques S.A.S. was no longer
within the scope of our consolidation, (iii) the estimated impact on our results from the operations of the Villa
Santa Lucia plant as if it had been fully operational for the year ended December 31, 2023, (iv) the estimated
future impact of a product price increase implemented in March 2024, as if such price increase had been
implemented in full as of October 1, 2023, based on the sales volumes generated in the quarter ended December
31, 2023, (v) the estimated impact on our results from certain cost saving and other improvement initiatives,
including in relation to the integration of Fiskeby in our business operations, that we have started implementing
and we intend to fully implement by 2025, as if such initiatives had been fully implemented as of January 1, 2023,
based on certain estimates and assumptions made by our management, and (vi) certain additional management
adjustments. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or
complete picture of the financial impact or results of our actions, initiatives and acquisitions for the period
presented.

The unaudited run rate adjusted pro forma financial information included in this Offering Memorandum

has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the
Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither
the assumptions underlying the run rate pro forma adjustments, nor the resulting pro forma financial information,
including Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards. Our estimate of potential cost savings, revenue-enhancing synergies and
growth-projections are also based on a number of assumptions and based on our judgment of information available
to us. Our estimate is forward-looking in nature and based on assumptions made by us that are inherently uncertain
in nature. Although we consider these estimates to be reasonable, they are subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainty and contingencies, which are difficult to predict and beyond our control.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these revenue-enhancing synergies, or any cost savings and synergies,
will be realized. If any of these or other factors cause our actual financial performance to differ significantly from
that implied by the pro forma financial information presented, including Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA,
they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

Moreover, such run rate adjusted pro forma financial information does not purport to indicate our future

consolidated results of operations. Our actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in such

58


-----

information and the calculations used to present such run rate adjusted pro forma financial information are based
on various assumptions and management estimates and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may
not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this
Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. These assumptions
and management estimates may depend on a number of circumstances that are outside our control or may not
materialize in line with our expectations.

**_Potential future impairments of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**

**_financial conditions and results of operation._**

Goodwill is a significant asset of the Group. As at December 31, 2023, the book value of the Group’s

goodwill amounted to €243.7 million, while the Group’s total intangible assets amounted to €124.3 million. The
Group evaluates goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually, or earlier in the case of a
triggering event. Goodwill impairment is indicated and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired when their
carrying amount exceeds their estimated recoverable amount, which is the greater of their value in use and their
fair value less cost to sell. A decrease in expected cash flows of the (group of) cash generating units, changes in
market conditions, loss of key customers and a change in our imputed cost of capital may indicate potential
impairment of recorded goodwill. Weakness in the global economy, including due to the ongoing military
conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the recent inflationary surge, also may cause us to make impairment
charges, which, depending on the amounts impaired, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The failure to make successful mergers and acquisitions and divestments could have a negative impact_**

**_on our competitiveness. Additional acquisitions may also expose us to new liabilities._**

As part of our business strategy and development, we aim to transform ourselves from a traditional

cartonboard producer to a customer-focused renewable materials company. Such transformation depends on our
ability to understand the needs of our customers and find the best possible ways to serve them with the right
offering and product portfolio, delivered through innovation, organic growth and selective mergers and
acquisitions. We may seek opportunities through mergers with, or acquisitions of, pulp companies to stay
competitive or to enhance our position in our core areas of operation or to expand outside of current businesses.
For example, on July 1, 2021, we completed the Paprinsa Acquisition, on July 13, 2021, we completed the Eska
Acquisition and on July 13, 2023, we completed the Fiskeby Acquisition. Risks relating to mergers and
acquisitions include liabilities that we failed or were unable to identity or that we underestimated in the course of
performing due diligence investigations in connection with such transactions, including, for example, overdue
payables to suppliers and employees, tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods or liabilities in
respect of legal proceedings or intellectual property disputes or any proceedings relating to anti-corruption,
sanctions, anti-money laundering and related laws and regulations, amongst others. In addition, we may be unable
to successfully integrate and manage acquired operations and personnel, and to achieve anticipated economies of
scale or synergies, including the expansion of our geographical reach and customer base. If one or more of our
underlying assumptions regarding our targeted synergies proves to have been inaccurate, this could lead to
substantially higher costs than anticipated and we may not be able to realize fully, or in the anticipated time frame,
the expected benefits of our targeted synergies and cost savings. The achievement of our targeted synergies and
cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, and
our inability to realize such synergies and/or cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, past practices by acquired companies, such as in relation
to pollution, competition law breaches or corruption, could result in additional costs for us and cause reputational
damage.

We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition or merger opportunities and might not be able to

carry out acquisitions or mergers on attractive terms. Failure to participate in industry consolidation may have an
adverse effect on our strategic competitive position. Regulation of merger or acquisition activity by competition
authorities may also limit our ability to make future acquisitions or mergers. We have in the past recorded

59


-----

significant impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and
may be required to do so in the future in connection with any future acquisitions.

We have made some divestments in recent years in order to focus our operations and may pursue

additional divestments of our assets in the future. For example, on April 30, 2021, we finalized the disposal of
our FBB business through the sale of a 100% interest in our subsidiary R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S. Any future
divestments may be affected by many factors that are beyond our control, such as the availability of bank financing
to potential buyers, interest rates and competitors’ capacity, and may also lead to exposure to indemnity claims.
Furthermore, divestments may involve additional costs due to historical and unaccounted liabilities. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to divert assets in a profitable way, or that such divestments will be possible on
acceptable terms, or at all. The market situation may also affect our ability to accurately predict the length of time
needed for any acquisitions or divestments. Any transactions may also require extensive management attention,
which would divert the attention of our management away from the ongoing business. Our inability to realize the
full extent of the anticipated benefits of our strategic plans and investments in a profitable manner could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our business may suffer if we fail to retain, or are unable to attract, key management and skilled_**

**_workforce._**

Our success depends in large part on our ability to retain the services of our skilled senior management

team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees collectively have
extensive industry experience in cartonboard production processes and operations. It may be difficult to find new
personnel with comparable experience as competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool
of qualified candidates is limited. Moreover, if any of our executives or other key employees were to leave for a
competitor or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Our
success is dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly skilled personnel and the loss
of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Moreover, our high-quality production processes require employment of a skilled workforce. A number

of factors beyond our control, such as employee-turnover rates, prevailing wage rates, increased competition for
employees, local demographics, labor resources, benefits costs, unionization levels and local labor and
employment requirements, could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of
employees in the regions we operate in. If we are faced with labor shortages or increased labor costs, we could
be unable to meet our production requirements on a timely and cost-effective basis, which could have adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We sell our products in a number of countries and are consequently exposed to currency fluctuations._**

We incur foreign currency translation risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates of costs and revenues

denominated in currencies other than the euro. As far as our business is concerned, this exposure is particularly
related to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, a currency in which revenues from overseas markets is denominated
and, as far as costs are concerned, used for purchases of certain raw materials and energy factors. The value of
the U.S. dollar has fluctuated significantly against the euro in recent years, including periods in which the value
of the U.S. dollar has significantly appreciated and depreciated against the euro.

We report our financial results in euro and are consequently subject to currency translation risk because

a significant portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the euro. We also incur foreign currency
translation risk to the extent that our subsidiaries’ assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in
currencies other than euro. In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into euro at then applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and
decreases in the value of the euro versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated
financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result
in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. We hedge some of this currency

60


-----

translation risk by matching foreign currency assets with liabilities denominated in the same currency and by
entering into derivative transactions, including forward exchange rates contracts. Following the Fiskeby
Acquisition, we also face currency translation risks between the SEK vis-à-vis the euro and U.S. dollar.

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by

reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks
due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by
reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below
their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the
currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

**_Our operations are subject to risks of litigation that could negatively impact our operations and_**

**_revenues._**

The risks inherent in our business expose us to the risk of litigation and other claims that may arise in

the ordinary course of business and may include personal injury claims, environmental litigation, contractual
litigation with customers and suppliers, intellectual property litigation, tax or employment disputes, insurance
related lawsuits and product liability claims. The claims could involve complex factual and legal issues that would
require significant commitment from management and could result in substantial costs and fees and we may be
unable to accurately estimate the total expense associated with any such claims. By way of example, we are
currently involved, either directly as a party or indirectly, in the following material litigation proceedings: (i) a
criminal action for illegal trafficking of waste brought against certain former employees, a consultant and a senior
representative of RDM arising from the same seizure of the landfill located at Villa Santa Lucia plant; (ii) a
criminal action for manslaughter after a fatal accident which took place at the Ovaro plant in 2018; (iii) certain
commercial and administrative disputes, such as the pending litigation with the Municipality of Cassino
(Frosinone) about the payment of certain environmental taxes; and (iv) the seizure of the sewage treatment plant
serving the paper mill in Villa Santa Lucia by the Cassino Public Prosecutor’s Office. See also “—We are exposed
_to a risk relating to increasing tax burden” and “Business—Litigation.”_

We use machinery, fuels and certain chemicals that may contaminate the soil, air, water and buildings,

particularly in case of leakage or accidents. We may become liable to restore the condition of a real property
which was contaminated by us or the property’s previous user. Further, although our management is not currently
aware of any proceedings, it is possible that we could become subject to proceedings where a third party sues us
due to a breach of environmental legislation and we are ordered to pay damages. In addition, we could become
subject to liabilities and claims relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous substances used,
produced or disposed of by us), property damage or damage to natural resources. Exposure to environmental or
other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
future prospects.

Litigation trends and expenses and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. In

addition, we operate, among others, in Italy where significant uncertainty might materially affect both the length
and the outcome of the legal proceedings resulting, among others, in an adverse effect on our legal expenses,
reputation, business, results of operation and future prospects. Any future material litigation, arbitration or other
proceedings could also have adverse reputational and financial consequences for us and we may not have
established adequate provisions for any potential losses associated with such litigation or other proceedings not
otherwise covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations.

61


-----

**_Our governance, internal controls and compliance processes could fail to prevent regulatory_**

**_penalties, reputational harm and fraud._**

We operate in multiple jurisdictions and our activities are subject to complex regulatory frameworks at

a time of increased enforcement activity and initiatives in areas such as competition law and anticorruption. There
can be no assurance that our internal control measures will ensure the implementation and maintenance of
adequate controls over our financial reporting processes or that our operational risk management procedures will
detect and prevent misbehavior by individual employees. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and other
standards could subject us to fines, loss of operating licenses and reputational harm.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively

prevent and detect fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our financial results
could be negatively affected. Additionally, at the operational level, individual employees may not comply with
our policies and guidelines and as a result may cause us to incur compliance costs and cause us reputational
damage. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors and other third parties to lose confidence in our
reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all our losses._**

We carry insurance that we believe to be common in the industry and sufficient to cover the principal

risks of damage to our business. We maintain insurance policies with respect to certain operating risks, including
product liability, damage to property (including buildings, plants, machinery and stock, including as a result of
catastrophic events such as fire, flood, storms and earthquakes), industrial accidents, third-party liability,
directors’ and officers’ liability, and cyber-crime.

Our insurance is reviewed periodically to ensure that it sufficiently covers our business risks and is

reflective of the changes in our business. For example, we received the full amount of the insurance
reimbursement associated with the fire that occurred at the Blendecques mill in March 2022. However, it is
possible that the level of insurance we maintain may not be appropriate for the risks to our business or may not
provide sufficient cover for all potential claims. Certain types of losses may not be covered by our insurance
policies and may be either completely or partially uninsurable or not insurable on commercially reasonable terms,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Further, we may not be able to obtain future insurance coverage at current levels or at all, and our

premiums and deductibles may increase to an extent that we may choose to reduce our policy limits, increase our
deductibles or retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from the coverage. Among other factors, wars, terrorist
attacks, COVID-19 or other pandemics, military conflicts (including those in Ukraine and the Middle East),
adverse political developments, security concerns and natural disasters in any country which is directly or
indirectly linked to manufacturing or distribution of our products may materially adversely affect available
insurance coverage and result in increased premiums for available coverage and additional exclusions from
coverage. If any of the above risks were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

**_We are exposed to a risk relating to increasing tax burden._**

Possible changes to tax law and regulations in the countries where we operate may unfavorably increase

our tax burden. It is also possible that the relevant tax authorities could in the future interpret and apply tax
regulations in a way which would increase our tax burden. Additionally, we are subject to audits and other
measures by the tax authorities of different countries and there can be no assurances that tax increases or other
consequences for delay would not be imposed on us based on these audits and other measures. Major
developments in tax policy leading to increases in our tax burden which would have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

62


-----

Moreover, while we generally believe that we have appropriately remitted all taxes based on our

interpretation of applicable law, it is possible that some taxing jurisdictions may attempt to assess additional taxes
and penalties on us if the applicable authorities do not agree with our positions. Significant judgment is required
in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes, and actual results may differ from our
estimations. For example, we are currently subject to a pending litigation with the Municipality of Cassino
(Frosinone) about the payment of certain environmental taxes. See also “Business—Litigation” and “—Our
_operations are subject to risks of litigation that could negatively impact our operations and revenues.”_

A successful challenge by a tax authority, through asserting either an error in our calculation, or a change

in the application of law or an interpretation of the law that differs from our own, could adversely affect our
results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks related to antitrust, anti-corruption and anti-dumping proceedings._**

We are subject to applicable competition, anti-corruption and anti-dumping regulations, and there can

be no assurances that allegations of breaches of competition, anti-corruption or anti-dumping regulations will not
be made against us, or our employees, distributors or subcontractors, or that possible inspections will not lead to
a formal investigation and ultimately to a decision or a series of decisions concluding that there has been a
violation of the applicable competition, anti-corruption or anti-dumping laws which may lead to an imposition of
a fine. If, for instance, the EU Commission would find that there has been such a violation, we could face
significant fines. In such case, the decision may also be used by potential claimants in damage claims. Even if we
are currently not aware of any threatened proceedings or investigations regarding such breaches or alleged
breaches, there can be no assurances that such allegations or proceedings would not emerge and ultimately lead
to actions that, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks in relation to certain civil, administrative and/or criminal penalties as a result_**

**_of crimes committed by individuals having a functional relationship with us._**

Pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 231 of June 8, 2001 (the “231 Decree”), we may be held

responsible for certain crimes committed in our interest or for our benefit by individuals having a functional
relationship with us, including third party agents or intermediaries, unless we are able to prove that such
individuals fraudulently violated our internal controls and it would have been impossible for us to avoid such
violation. In such circumstances, we may be subject to fines, confiscations of profits or legal sanction (applied in
certain cases as interim measures during the relevant investigations), including the termination of financing
agreements and the suspension of our operations. The duration of these disqualifications can range from a
minimum of three months to a maximum of two years, although in particularly serious cases some of these
disqualifications can be applied permanently. Although we believe that we have adequate systems of control,
including the internal control model pursuant to the 231 Decree, aimed at, among other things, preventing direct
or indirect acts of corruption, bribery, anti-competitive behavior, money laundering, fraud, deception, tax evasion
and any other illegal or otherwise unethical conducts, we seek to continuously improve our systems of internal
controls and to remedy any weaknesses we identify through appropriate corrective action depending on the
circumstances. There can be no assurance, however, that our policies and procedures will be followed at all times
or effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our employees, consultants,
agents or partners and, if we fail to prevent any such violations (including a failure on our part to adequately
implement and update the necessary monitoring systems), we could be subject to civil, administrative and/or
criminal penalties, including pursuant to the provisions of the 231 Decree and materially adverse consequences
on our overall business, results of operations, reputation and/or financial condition.

**_Changes in accounting standards could significantly affect our reported financial results or financial_**

**_condition._**

The accounting standards applicable to our business, including but not limited to accounting standards

in respect of revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, inventory, income taxes and

63


-----

litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in
these standards or their interpretation, or changes in the underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, could
significantly change our reported financial performance or financial condition.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to assets with_**

**_sustainability characteristics._**

In connection with the Offering, we have adopted the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework,

which was reviewed by Sustainalytics, who provided the Second Party Opinion. The Second Party Opinion may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors that may affect
the value of the Notes. The Second Party Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and is only current as of the date it is released. A withdrawal of the Second Party Opinion may affect
the value of the Notes and/or may have consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in
sustainability-linked assets. We do not assume any obligation or responsibility to release any update or revision
to the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and/or information to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of publication of such Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and, therefore, an update or a revision of
the Second Party Opinion may or may not be requested to Sustainalytics or other providers of second party
opinions.

Moreover, the Second Party Opinion provider and providers of similar opinions and certifications are

not currently subject to any specific regulatory or other regime or oversight. Any such opinion or certification is
not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by the Issuer, the Guarantors or any member of the Group,
the Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion providers, the External Reviewer or any other person to buy, sell
or hold the Notes. Noteholders have no recourse against the Issuer, the Guarantors, any of the Initial Purchasers
or the provider of any such opinion or certification for the contents of any such opinion or certification, which is
only current as at the date it was initially issued. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the
relevance of any such opinion or certification and/or the information contained therein and/or the provider of such
opinion or certification for the purpose of any investment in the Notes. Any withdrawal of any such opinion or
certification or any such opinion or certification attesting that we are not complying in whole or in part with any
matters for which such opinion or certification is opining on or certifying on may have a material adverse effect
on the value of the Notes and/or result in adverse consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to
invest in securities to be used for a particular purpose.

Furthermore, although the interest rate relating to the Notes is subject to upward adjustment in the

circumstance specified in “Description of the Notes,” such Notes may not satisfy an investor’s requirements or
any future legal or quasi legal standards for investment in assets with sustainability characteristics. The Notes are
not being marketed as green bonds since we expect to use the relevant net proceeds in connection with the
Acquisition. Therefore, the net proceeds of the Offering will not be allocated specifically to projects or business
activities meeting environmental or sustainability criteria, or be subject to any other limitations associated with
green bonds.

Although we are committed to achieve the Sustainability Performance Targets, there can be no assurance

of the extent to which we will be successful in doing so. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future
investments we make in furtherance of the Sustainability Performance Targets will meet investor expectations or
any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance, in particular with regard to any
direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact. Adverse environmental or social impacts may
occur during the design, construction and operation of any investments that we make in furtherance of the
Sustainability Performance Targets. Investments we make in furtherance of the Sustainability Performance
Targets may become controversial or criticized by stakeholders. It will not be an event of default under the Notes,
nor will we be required to repurchase or redeem the Notes, if we fail to meet the Sustainability Performance
Targets. Moreover, should we fail to satisfy the Sustainability Performance Targets, we will be required to pay
an increased margin or interest rate on the Notes, which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity and financial

64


-----

position. Should we satisfy the Sustainability Performance Targets, holders of Notes will not be entitled to an
increase in the interest rate or margin, as applicable, on the Notes.

Moreover, key performance indicators on which our Sustainability Performance Targets are based are

calculated internally by the Group based on broadly accepted industry standards. These standards and guidelines
may change over time, which may affect the way in which we calculate our key performance indicators and may
impact our ability to meet our Sustainability Performance Targets. The standards and guidelines continue to be
reviewed by expert groups and include contributions from industry bodies, which may change going forward.
Any change to our organic business development, the methodology and/or data sources used for calculating key
performance indicators may result in a significant change in the Sustainability Performance Targets, key
performance indicators and/or baseline. In such case, we will recalculate, in good faith, the levels of the relevant
baseline, Sustainability Performance Targets and/or key performance indicators to reflect such changes. Any such
change(s) may be made without the prior consultation of the holders of the Notes, to the extent it does not have a
material adverse effect in the interests of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes.”

We expect to report on an annual basis on progress on our key performance indicators, including an

explanation of methodologies and supporting documentation used in such calculations, but a failure to do so will
not constitute a default or event of default under the Notes or any other agreement.

**_Even if we meet the Sustainability Performance Targets, there can be no assurance that we will_**

**_continue to meet our Sustainability Performance Targets thereafter._**

Even if we meet our initial Sustainability Performance Targets, there can be no assurance that we will

continue to maintain the levels set by the Sustainability Performance Targets in the future. In addition, we may
not be successful in continuing to improve our sustainability metrics in line with our longer-term sustainability
targets as set out in our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework or we may meet such targets later than
anticipated. Other than the increase in the interest rate, there are no penalties in the Indenture or any other
agreement associated with failing to maintain the levels set by our Sustainability Performance Targets or by failing
to meet any future sustainability targets.

**_Our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business._**

We are leveraged and have debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2023, after giving effect to the

Transactions, the principal amount of our total financial liabilities would have been €646 million, which is
represented mainly by the Notes. See “Capitalization.” As of the same date, after giving effect to the Transactions,
we would also have had approximately €100 million available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility,
after giving effect to any ancillary facilities. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee
_Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”_

We anticipate that our high leverage will continue and may increase for the foreseeable future due in

part to expected investments in connection with our growth strategy.

Our leverage could have important consequences to the holders of the Notes, including: (i) making it

more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations with respect to the Notes and other debt liabilities; (ii)
increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic and industry conditions; (iii) placing us at
a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow; (iv) limiting
our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditures,
business opportunities and other corporate requirements; (v) requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of
our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which means that
this cash flow will not be available to fund our operations and for other corporate purposes; and (vi) limiting our
flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and our industry.

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future which could mature prior to the Notes. Although

the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject

65


-----

to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of
indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the
Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those
agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering
Memorandum.

If we cannot service our indebtedness and our other obligations and commitments, we might be required

to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that
refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would
be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments. All these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and_**

**_the Indenture that may limit the Group’s ability to finance its future operations and capital needs, and to_**
**_pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will contain negative covenants restricting,

among other things, our ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

    - make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making other distributions, making
investments and prepaying or redeeming subordinated indebtedness or equity;

    - create or incur certain liens;

    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets;

    - enter into arrangements that restrict dividends or other payments to us;

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

    - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

    - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis; and

    - enter into certain other transactions and activities.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of

_the Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

The restrictions that will be contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture

could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take
advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect
our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our
organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions
may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry
conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement or the Indenture.

If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that is not cured or waived, the holders

of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments thereunder and cause all amounts outstanding with

66


-----

respect to such indebtedness to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross defaults under
our other debt instruments, including the Notes. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation,
and we may not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness, including at the level of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries,_**

**_which could increase our risk exposure from debt and could decrease your share in any proceeds distributed_**
**_in connection with any insolvency or other winding-up of such subsidiaries._**

Subject to restrictions that will be in the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we may

incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with our already substantial indebtedness.
Following the Refinancing, we will have the ability to borrow up to €100 million under our Revolving Credit
Facility, after giving effect to any ancillary facilities. The terms of the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will permit us to incur additional debt.

Our non-Guarantor subsidiaries may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the

future, further increasing the risks associated with our leverage. If any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incurs
additional indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ahead of you in any proceeds distributed
in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of such
subsidiaries. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements.” If we incur additional
indebtedness, the related risks that we now face, as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors,” could
intensify.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service debt and for other general corporate purposes and_**

**_our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments to meet our other debt service obligations, including under the Revolving

Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture and to fund working capital and product development and make any
acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance and the ability to generate
sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and
other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors”
and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations and additional debt and equity

financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including
the interest on the Notes, our other debt service obligations, including under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The ability to refinance our debt may depend on stable loan or
debt capital markets. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity of the Group.” In addition, the Indenture will permit_
us to make certain dividends, distributions or other payments to our shareholder, to make regularly scheduled
cash interest payments on our debt (or any refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) as well as the repurchase
or retirement for value of such indebtedness in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of, subordinated indebtedness
incurred by the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries in compliance with the Indenture.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations

as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: (i) reduce or delay our business activities,
research and development and capital expenditures; (ii) sell assets; (iii) obtain additional debt or equity financing;
or (iv) restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. If we are
not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms
or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. If we are also unable to satisfy
our obligations on other financing arrangements, we could be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Indenture and other relevant financing agreements which we may enter into in the future. In the
event of a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or certain other defaults under any other
agreement, the lenders under the respective facilities or financing instruments could take certain actions, including
terminating their commitments and declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit facilities and

67


-----

other indebtedness to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Such a default, or a failure
to make interest payments on the Notes, could mean that borrowings under other debt instruments that contain
cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, may as a
result also be accelerated and become due and payable. If the debt under the Revolving Credit Facility or the
Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we have entered into or will subsequently enter into were
to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay the Notes in full. Any such actions could force us into
bankruptcy or liquidation, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Hedging arrangements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging_**

**_counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

We may enter into interest hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates,

including under the Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility. We may also enter into currency hedging
arrangements in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility or any other of our indebtedness. Under any such
agreements, we would be exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls
into bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging
arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate
such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**_Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or_**

**_repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of_**
**_control or otherwise, and the change of control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not_**
**_necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including an event deemed_**
**_not to be a change of control when, at the time of such event, our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than_**
**_certain specified levels._**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes following an event of default,

the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and payable. In addition, upon the
occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of the Notes may in certain circumstances
require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description
_of the Notes—Change of Control.” The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for_
additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due.

The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event

would result in an event of default under the Notes. If a change of control event were to occur, we cannot assure
you that we would have sufficient funds to repay our outstanding indebtedness which we would be required to
prepay or offer to purchase or that became immediately due and payable as a result. We may require additional
financing from third parties to fund any such purchases and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain
financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions that will be in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or
our other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict us from making such required repurchases. See
“Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Maturity and
_Repayment Requirements.” A change of control will be a mandatory prepayment event under our Revolving_
Credit Facility Agreement and a change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our
other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under other
indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not.

The change of control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you

protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of
control” as will be defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of

68


-----

_Control,” the Indenture will not contain a provision that requires us to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in_
the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under

the Indenture will be deemed not be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less
than certain specified levels. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

The definition of “change of control” that will be contained in the Indenture will include a disposition

of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes.

**_Italian tax legislation may restrict the deductibility of all or a portion of the interest expense on our_**

**_indebtedness, including interest expense in respect of the Notes._**

Current tax legislation in Italy (provided for by Article 96 of Italian Presidential Decree No. 917 of

December 22, 1986 (“Article 96”), as amended by Italian Legislative Decree No. 142 of November 29, 2018)
allows for the full tax deductibility of interest expense incurred by the Issuer in each fiscal year up to the amount
of the interest income of the same fiscal year, as evidenced by the relevant annual financial statements. A further
deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of EBITDA (i.e.,
_risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”), as well as 30% of ROL carried forward from_
previous fiscal years. The ROL is calculated on the basis of the value of the items of the Issuer’s profit and loss
account, which are comprised of the operating gross revenues and expenses (excluding depreciation of tangible
and intangible assets, as well as leasing fees), as determined through the application of the tax rules concerning
the determination of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the
amount of interest expense in a fiscal year can be carried forward for the following five fiscal years. The amount
of any interest income exceeding the interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward without time limits.
Interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years and
deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds
interest income (also carried forward from previous fiscal years) is lower than 30% of ROL. In the case of Italian
tax resident companies participating in the same tax consolidated group, interest expenses not deducted by an
entity at stand-alone level due to a lack of individual ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit
of the excess of ROL of the other companies in that tax consolidated group, in certain cases. Article 96 does not
apply to certain entities active in the insurance and financial sector.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

_The risk factors discussed in this sub-section “—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the_

_Collateral” are provided for prospective investors to assess the risks related to the guarantee and collateral_
_structure that is intended to be put into place on or about the Issue Date and following the Issue Date. As such,_
_unless otherwise stated, references to “Collateral” in this section “Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral” refers to the Collateral as such term is defined under “Description of the Notes.”_

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent or the Trustee rather than_**

**_directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of Collateral may be_**
**_restricted by applicable law._**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable

law, only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents relating to the Issue Date Collateral

69


-----

and the Additional Collateral on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such
contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions
of the Indenture and the Security Documents, as applicable) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect
of the Collateral and, in the case of the Issue Date Collateral and the Additional Collateral, in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of
a default. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Moreover, in Italy the Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of U.S. Bank Trustees Limited,

as Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such Code provision (introduced by
Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly
created in favor of an representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to
exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial
proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law
on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and Guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant
to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the
Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant
share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will

not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent,
acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have
recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note,
you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will
have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent or Trustee to enforce the security interests is subject to

mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken,
including the Republic of Italy. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation
of certain pledged assets but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There
is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the
Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly
secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the
Republic of Italy).

In certain jurisdictions (including Germany), due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the

creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests (in particular security
interest of an accessory nature), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt”
obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture and/or the Guarantees, as
applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not
be applicable unless Italian courts have ruled for their application. All or part of the pledges and other security
interests in jurisdictions utilizing the Parallel Debt construct will be granted to the Security Agent as security
interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time
as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such

70


-----

security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions,
including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions,
including under Italian and Dutch law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Notes Collateral created
to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in
the Notes Collateral.

Furthermore, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, security can be

created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) who are neither directly parties to
the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as the Trustee of the
holders of the Notes, since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise
nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Trustee as agent or trustee for holders of
the Notes under security interests on Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

Further, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security

interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes
could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under
the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “Suspect
**Period”). In this regard, a longer period might apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law.**

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given

statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors. See
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and certain insolvency law
_considerations.”_

The enforcement of the Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory

provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms
of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements.

In case of insolvency of any Guarantor of the Notes, the enforcement of any collateral provided by such

Guarantor of the Notes may be subject to certain restrictions. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect_**

**_security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law (including Italian and German law), a security interest in certain tangible and

intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by
the secured party and/or the grantor of the security interest, as applicable. The security interests in the Collateral
may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or the Trustee or the Security Agent fails
or is unable to take the actions required to be taken to perfect the security interest. Such failure may result in the
invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral or difficulty in enforcing such Collateral or adversely
affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in
bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral, which may have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the holders of Notes to receive proceeds from any enforcement of the Collateral.
The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action
to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

The Trustee and Security Agent will not monitor, and we may not comply with our obligations to inform

the Trustee or the Security Agent of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action
may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights. Such failure

71


-----

may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of such
security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors
who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

The granting of new security interests in connection with the Notes may create hardening periods for

such security interests in Italy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security_
_interests in accordance with Italian law,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests_
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security_**

**_for the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the

Collateral underlying their security interest. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may also
be secured by the Collateral. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral,
the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to the Notes. As described elsewhere, the extent of the Collateral is limited and, in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, Guarantees and/or security shall only be granted by certain
entities. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In addition, pursuant to the Indenture, the Issuer and its
subsidiaries may in certain cases incur indebtedness which may be secured on a super priority basis, including
indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. Holders of such other secured indebtedness may have rights
and remedies which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.
Moreover, if we issue additional notes, holders of such Additional Notes would benefit from the same Collateral
as the holders of the Notes, thereby diluting such holders’ ability to benefit from the Collateral. If the value of the
Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the other holders of the Notes together with the claims of the
other secured creditors, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are
paid.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with

the Offering. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend
on many factors, including among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory
restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, prevailing market and
other economic conditions and the availability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, prevailing market and other
economic conditions and the availability of suitable buyers at the time of any such sale. By its nature, the
Collateral may be illiquid and have no ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you that there will
be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in
the liquidation of the Collateral. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of the
realizable value for such assets. The fair market value of the Collateral as at the date of this Offering Memorandum
may not exceed the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the Collateral, and in particular,
the pledged capital stock could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, failure to
implement our business strategy, competition and other future trends and may be without any value if that entity
is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

Value of the pledged stock, ability of suitable buyers and the amount to be received upon sale of such

Collateral could also be impaired in case the non-pledged stock in the same entity is held by minority shareholders.
In this respect it should also be noted that the Issuer currently has saving shares in issue which are capable of
being converted in ordinary shares representing 0.061% of its share capital. These saving shares of the Issuer (and
any ordinary shares attributed to the relevant holders following a conversion) will in any case not form part of the
Collateral until the moment they get acquired by the Issuer or any of its direct and/or indirect shareholder(s) and,
subject to Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, security is created over such saving
shares.

**_Holders of the Notes will not receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral until after certain_**

**_super senior creditors are repaid and may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

To the extent permitted under applicable law, and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed

Security Principles, the Notes will be secured on a first priority basis by substantially the same rights, property
and assets securing our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, under the terms
of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may
be secured by the same Collateral.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, secured creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, providers

of certain additional super priority indebtedness, certain priority hedging obligations, if any, the Security Agent,
any receiver and certain creditor representatives, including the Trustee, will be entitled to be repaid with the
proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant
to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a
foreclosure of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if
the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under super priority indebtedness are greater than or equal to the
proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral and all amounts received by the
Security Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will, after all obligations under
super priority indebtedness have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the
Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes
and certain non-priority hedging obligations, which obligations may be significant. As a result, holders of Notes
may receive less, ratably, than holders of other secured indebtedness of the Group.

The Intercreditor Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct

the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent shall act upon the instructions of the Instructing
Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which will mean: (i) creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of
the indebtedness and commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain super priority hedging
obligations and additional super priority indebtedness (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”); and (ii)
creditors holding more than 50% of the indebtedness under the Notes and indebtedness ranking pari passu with
the Notes (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor
representative) prior to the “Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).
The Intercreditor Agreement will further provide that in the event that the Majority Super Senior Creditors and
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not consented to the relevant enforcement instructions or if conflicting
enforcement instructions are received from any creditor representative prior to the Credit Facility Lender
Discharge Date, the creditor representatives must consult with each other in good faith for a period of 15 days to
agree on joint enforcement instructions. Although enforcement instructions given by holders of the Notes and
certain other creditors may prevail after such 15-day consultation period, under certain circumstances,
enforcement instructions by the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility and certain other creditors will
prevail.

If the creditor representatives are not able to agree on joint enforcement instructions by the end of the

consultation period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the
enforcement instructions (if any) given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, provided that if: (i) the super senior creditors (comprised of the creditors in respect of
our Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to certain of our super priority hedging arrangements and
other holders of additional super priority indebtedness) have not been fully repaid within six months of the end
of the consultation period; (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three months
of the end of the consultation period; or (iii) the Issuer or certain of its subsidiaries becomes subject to insolvency
or similar proceedings and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action at that time, then the
instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent that we incur further
indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a _pari passu basis with the Notes, your voting interest in the_
Majority Senior Secured Creditors will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

73


-----

As these other creditors and counterparties may have interests that are different from the interests of

holders of the Notes and may elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the Collateral at a time when it would
be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so, these arrangements could result in the enforcement of
the Collateral in a manner that results in lower recoveries by holders of the Notes. Furthermore, other creditors
not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer or its
subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable
bankruptcy and/or insolvency laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in
value. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result
of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the
Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See
“Description of the Notes—Security; the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Issuer and the other security providers will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the_**

**_operation of the business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the other security providers to remain in possession

of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, certain of the
Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and
the other security providers may, among other things, subject to the terms of the security documents, without any
release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the
Collateral such as selling, modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making
ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the
value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the
Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the Collateral. To the extent these activities are allowed
with regard to certain security interests, under Italian law such security interests could be considered to be not
validly perfected.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections

permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first
issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the
timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under Italian law.

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security

interests in collateral. The Security Agent is generally prevented from appropriating Italian Collateral save where
certain conditions are met in respect of financial collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent
of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In
addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such
assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of
the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, due consideration should be given by investors to the
circumstance that enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Italy may be materially
more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be
familiar.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may result in_**

**_a taxable capital gain._**

In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding debt

obligations, any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such entity, which
could result in a taxable capital gain to such entities. The Indenture will not prohibit the Guarantors from incurring

74


-----

additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledges over the Guarantors’
shares may result in the release of the debt obligations of the Guarantors. Such release will be permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the
proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over the
shares of the Guarantors is subject to limitations.

**_The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_**

**_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability._**

The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of the Guarantees and the obligations of the

grantors of security and enforcement of the Collateral will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the
relevant provisions of the applicable security documents and, in any case, limited to the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed and/or secured, as applicable, by such guarantor and/or grantor of security under the applicable
laws, including a limitation to the extent that the grant of such pledge or security is not in the relevant guarantor’s
and/or security grantor’s corporate interests, or otherwise would result in violations of laws related to corporate
benefit, capitalization, capital preservation or maintenance, financial assistance or transactions under value. See
“Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

Accordingly, enforcement of the Guarantees against the Guarantors or enforcement of the Collateral

against the relevant security grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors generally or, in
some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory
requirements applicable to the Guarantors, or in some cases, to limitations contained in the pledge or security
designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant security grantor. These laws
and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences,
financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation or maintenance of share capital, thin capitalization
and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the Guarantors’ liability under its Guarantees
or the liability of a pledgor of security could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the law applicable
to it.

The obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor and/or

a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional
limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security
documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above
corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be

required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the
relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will
ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian
security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further
_pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and_
vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees
and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor
and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any agreement regulating future _pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor_
Agreement the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto
shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents
will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee
and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the
relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

In addition to the above, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued

by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee

75


-----

must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and
expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture).
It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee
could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed among

the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Further, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security

or guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the
application of applicable financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances you
would have no direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party
with respect to any such additional collateral.

It is possible that a guarantor or a pledgor of security, or a creditor of a pledgor of security, or the

bankruptcy trustee in the case of bankruptcy of a pledgor of security, may contest the validity and enforceability
of the Guarantees or the pledgor’s pledge of security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable
court may determine that the pledge should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations on the security
obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable guarantor or
pledgor, including trade payables of such pledgor to the extent of such limitations. Future guarantees or pledges
may be subject to similar limitations.

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an

insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a
court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor
is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater
recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced
within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given

statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even
if such claims are secured claims. For a more detailed description of various limitations on the security under
applicable law and certain insolvency law considerations, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**

**_and/or the Guarantees may be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be automatically

and unconditionally released. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer
or certain of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement,
then claims under the Notes and the Guarantees may be released or transferred. Your ability to recover on the
Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Security; the
_Collateral,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Indenture and the_
Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in
connection with the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness, if it is not possible to implement any such
transaction by instead granting additional Collateral and amending the terms of the existing Collateral. In certain
jurisdictions, including Italy, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new
“hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency

76


-----

administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such
Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral
and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Guarantees
and the Collateral will be subject to release in connection with a distressed disposal. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Distressed Disposal”_ and “Description of the Notes—
_Security; the Collateral.”_

Additionally, even though the holders of Notes will share in the Collateral with the secured parties under

the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the secured parties under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
certain of our hedging agreements will receive the proceeds of the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the
holders of the Notes and, under certain circumstances, the secured parties under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral
through the Security Agent, whether or not the holders of the Notes agree with those actions. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral Holders of the Notes may not control certain_
_decisions regarding the Collateral.”_

**_The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security_**

**_interests in accordance with Italian law._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the Offering and the confirmation or extension

of security interest in respect of certain amendments to the relevant secured obligations or addition or substitution
of the relevant collateral may create hardening periods for such security interests in Italy and the relevant regime
for hardening periods may be less favorable if the secured debt (or part thereof) is pre-existing to the granting of
the security interest. In addition, the granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may
restart or reopen such hardening periods. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will
run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. In each instance, if the
security interest granted, perfected or re-created were to be enforced before the end of the relevant hardening
period applicable in Italy, such security interest may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.
See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new

security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected
or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective applicable hardening period, it may be declared
void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure
future indebtedness or the transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening
periods. The applicable hardening period may run from the moment such new security is amended, transferred,
assigned, granted or perfected. If the security interest granted were to be enforced before the end of the respective
applicable hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The rights of holders of the Notes
_in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.”_

**_The insolvency laws of Italy, Germany and other foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to_**

**_holders of Notes as U.S. insolvency laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar._**

The Issuer is organized and is likely to have its center of main interests under the laws of Italy.

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantors organized under the laws of
Italy may proceed under, and be governed by, Italian insolvency law. The Guarantors are organized and
incorporated under the laws of Italy, Germany and The Netherlands, as applicable. Under Regulation (EU) No.
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast)
(the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies in the European Union (other than Denmark) and, in the
case of insolvency proceedings opened before December 31, 2020, in the UK, the court which has jurisdiction to
open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state or UK jurisdiction
(as applicable) in which the company’s “center of main interests” is situated. There is a rebuttable presumption

77


-----

that the “center of main interests” as defined in the Recast Insolvency Regulation is the jurisdiction where the
registered office is situated. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdictions the insolvency or similar proceedings would first be commenced or how
these proceedings would be resolved. Proceedings could be initiated in Italy, Germany, The Netherlands or any
other relevant jurisdiction, and your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees and your security interests in the
Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of Italy, Germany and The Netherlands.

The insolvency laws of Italy, Germany, The Netherlands or other foreign jurisdictions may not be as

favorable to your interests as those of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar,
including in respect of creditors’ reorganization, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest
and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the
Notes or Guarantees to the extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. In the event that
the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the insolvency and other laws of Italy may
be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other
creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights against
the Collateral in Italy and limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_**

**_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral._**

Under applicable fraudulent conveyance laws, a court could void the Notes, the Guarantees or the

Collateral or subordinate the claims thereunder to other claims against the Issuer or the Guarantors if it was
determined that the Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable:

    - issued the Notes (or the Guarantees or Collateral were granted) with actual intent to hinder, delay
or defraud creditors or shareholders;

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the Notes (or granting
the Guarantees or the Collateral), and, at the time thereof was insolvent or rendered insolvent by
reason of issuing the Notes (or granting the Guarantees or Collateral);

    - was engaged or about to engage in a business or a transaction for which remaining assets available
to carry on business constituted unreasonably small capital;

    - intended to incur, or believed that the Issuer would incur, debts beyond the ability to pay the debts
as they mature; or

    - was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages rendered
against it if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied.

The measures of insolvency for the purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law

applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity
would be considered insolvent if at the time it incurred the debt:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its
assets;

78


-----

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay
its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute
and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot be sure as to what standard a court would apply in making a solvency determination or that

a court would conclude that the Issuer was solvent immediately after the Offering. Regardless of the standard that
the court uses, we cannot be sure that the Offering (or grant of the Collateral) would not be voided or subordinated
to our other debt.

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors organized under the laws of Italy (or any

future Italian guarantor of the Notes) enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to secure
the Notes (and any guarantees thereof, if applicable) could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or by other creditors under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law, Italian
Insolvency Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the
debtor during a Suspect Period. The avoidance may relate to: (i) transactions made by the debtor within a Suspect
Period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or
obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or
involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured
obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity
in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the
creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any
clawback action during the Suspect Period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency; and (iii)
payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the
creation of the secured obligations during the Suspect Period of six months prior to the declaration of the
insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver must prove that the creditor was aware of the
state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any clawback action. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective

_vis-à-vis_ creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In
addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the twoyear period prior to insolvency. In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which
replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the
European Union. Furthermore, under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited
exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by
the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or
within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction
which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate
by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding,
without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested
person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164
of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration
of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application
followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding or in the prior two-year period; and (B) payments made
by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or
after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors.

If challenged successfully, the Guarantees and security interest may become unenforceable and any

amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of the Guarantees or any

79


-----

security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the Guarantees and/or the security
interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

**_We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to refinance indebtedness maturing prior to the stated_**

**_maturity of the Notes or to repay the Notes at maturity._**

The Notes offered hereby will mature on, 2029. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the

date falling six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. In addition, all of our other indebtedness that will remain
outstanding following the Refinancing may be terminated or repayable prior to the respective maturities of the
Notes. As a result, we may not have sufficient cash to repay all amounts owing on the Notes at maturity, since
the prior maturity of such other indebtedness may make it difficult to refinance the Notes offered hereby. In
addition, if our access to capital markets or our ability to enter new financing arrangements is reduced for any
reason, we may not be able to refinance our Revolving Credit Facility on satisfactory terms or at all, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks as certain of our borrowings bear, and the Notes and the_**

**_Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates that could be impacted by applicable regulation_**
**_and that could rise significantly. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

The Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates of interest equal to the

applicable three-month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) for the relevant interest period plus a margin adjusted at
regular intervals. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future reducing cash flow available for capital
expenditures and hinder our ability to make payments on the Notes. As of and from the Step-Up Date, this interest
rate will increase by 0.125%, 0.250% or 0.375% depending on whether respectively, one, two or three
Sustainability Performance Targets are not achieved, unless the Issuer has achieved the Sustainability
Performance Targets by December 31, 2025, as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying
Agent) on or prior to the Certification Date. See “Description of the Notes—Calculation of Interest.” Moreover,
for the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, a floor of 0% applies to the calculation of EURIBOR.
Accordingly, should the relevant EURIBOR remain below 0%, we would not be able to benefit from such
decrease. The Indenture will not contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate
debt. In addition, the deferred price component of the Fiskeby Acquisition amounts to approximately €8.7 million
as of December 31, 2023 and bears interest substantially in line with the Notes. We may, however, elect to enter
into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix these rates, although there can be no assurance that we will
enter into hedging or that hedging will be available on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, hedging carries
certain risks, including that we may need to pay significant amounts (including costs) to terminate any hedging
arrangements. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. On the other hand, if interest rates were to decrease, holders of
the Notes would receive lower interest payments, and the market price of the Notes could decline, any of which
may significantly impact the value of, and return on, their investment.

Various interest rate benchmarks (including EURIBOR) are the subject of recent national and

international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU
Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) and the cessation of the publication of Sterling LIBOR rates
and certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, while others are still to be implemented.
These reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR, SONIA, SOFR or other such benchmarks to disappear
entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create
disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other
consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that (a)
any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as
manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a
sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an
adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR,
SONIA or SOFR (or any of their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments
to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to

80


-----

any of our obligations which have not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest
applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the
relevant documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the
provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market
circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time). If we determine that EURIBOR has
been permanently discontinued an alternative reference rate for EURIBOR will be used. In addition, the
development of alternatives to EURIBOR may result in our floating rate debt (including the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility) performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to
EURIBOR had not developed.

**_The Issuer may amend certain economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent_**

**_of all the holders of the Notes with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the_**
**_outstanding Notes._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider matters

affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and
_Waiver,” the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of the Notes will be_
one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes (or, in certain circumstances, the applicable series of outstanding Notes). These provisions permit defined
majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes, including
holders of the Notes who did not attend or vote at the relevant meeting, and holders who vote in a manner contrary
to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other
things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes,
to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to reduce the
principal or extend the stated maturity of the Notes, change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to
change such amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact your rights as a holder of the
Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval
of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of one-half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be
challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and/or others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian
court, with the consequence that the majority voting threshold would be reduced from 75% to 50%.

Furthermore, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to

meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in
the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of
holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also untested in the Italian courts.

**_Transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. state securities

laws. You may not offer the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant
to an effective registration statement. The Notes and the Indenture contain provisions that restrict the Notes from
being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A
and Regulation S, or other exceptions, under the Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes
under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and resales of the Notes
within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_You may have difficulty enforcing your rights against the Issuer and its directors and executive_**

**_officers._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated in Italy, Germany, The Netherlands or jurisdictions other

than the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New
York courts in connection with certain actions under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of

81


-----

process within the United States on their directors and executive officers. In addition, as all of the assets of the
Issuer and of the Guarantors are, as of the Issue Date, located outside of the United States you may be unable to
enforce against those judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States. In addition, our local counsel has informed us that it is questionable whether,
among others, an Italian or German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were
commenced in Italy or Germany, as applicable, predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. See “Service
_of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.” You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of_**

**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and are currently held through

Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the global notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive
registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very
limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. In
circumstances where Definitive Registered Notes are issued, the Issuer understands that the Notes will no longer
be eligible for clearance by Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with their respective customary procedures,
and holders of Definitive Registered Notes will therefore be required to rely on the procedures described under
“Book Entry, Delivery and Form.” The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, is the
sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes and will be entered as such in the register of
holders of the Notes maintained by the Registrar and the Issuer at its registered office. Payments of principal,
interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to
Elavon Financial Services DAC as Paying Agent, which then will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream.
Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global
notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of
interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry
interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in
Euroclear and Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise
any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right

to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if you own a book-entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of
such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive

Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and
Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book Entry,
_Delivery and Form.”_

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the Indenture by beneficial owners with short_**

**_positions in excess of their interests in the Notes may be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes agrees, in connection with any notice of default, notice

of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other
action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuer and the Trustee that such
holder is not, or, in the case such holder is the Relevant Clearing System (as defined under “Description of the
_Notes”), or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial_
owners that are not, Net Short (as defined under “Description of the Notes”), and (ii) provide the Issuer with such
other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such
holder’s representation within five Business Days of request thereof. Holders of the Notes, including holders that

82


-----

have hedged their exposure to the Notes in the ordinary course and not for speculative purposes, may not be able
to make such representations or provide the requested additional information. These may impact a holder’s ability
to participate in Noteholder Directions, subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law and without prejudice to
the provisions regarding meetings of the holders of the Notes set out under “Description of the Notes.”

Provisions contemplating restrictions to the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant

meeting are untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and/or others, and
if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court. Furthermore, the interactions between (i) the provisions set
forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights
of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to
quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also untested in the Italian
courts.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a

rating of “BBB-”or better from S&P and “Baa3” or better from Moody’s or an equivalent rating from another
rating agency and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and
continuing until such time that the Notes receive a rating of below “BBB-” from S&P and below “Baa3” from
Moody’s or an equivalent rating from another rating agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the
Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of
_Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional_
indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of
holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or
that any such rating will be maintained.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be_**

**_subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign a credit rating to the Notes. The rating may

not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above
and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the
future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by
a credit rating agency may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to the Group’s tax position could adversely affect the Group’s_**

**_results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could materially adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate

or tax payments, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws
and regulations. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of
these laws and regulations and, if our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of
additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we do not currently collect or pay or increase the costs of our
services to track and collect such taxes. In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our
judgment to determine our provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. The tax authorities
may not agree with our interpretations of, or with the positions we have taken or intend to take on, tax laws
applicable to our ordinary activities and extraordinary transactions. These complex matters include transfer
pricing and reporting relating to intercompany transactions. In certain of our jurisdictions, we may also be subject
to criminal penalties if the tax authorities find us to be in contravention of the applicable legislation. Although we

83


-----

believe our judgments are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of any tax audits and related litigation could be
different from any of our provisions for taxes and may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Italian withholding taxes or deduction of taxes may be payable on amounts paid by the Italian resident_**

**_guarantors._**

Under a certain interpretation, payments made by the Italian resident guarantors organized under the

laws of Italy to non-resident entities without an Italian permanent establishment to which the Notes are effectively
connected may be subject to Italian withholding taxes or deduction of taxes. In the event such Italian withholding
or deduction of taxes apply, there will be additional amounts paid, subject to certain customary exceptions. The
possible imposition of withholding taxes or deduction of taxes with respect to payments on the Notes and the
resulting obligation to pay additional amounts to holders of the Notes could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

**_You generally will not be entitled to a gross-up for any Italian withholding taxes, unless the Italian_**

**_withholding tax is caused by a failure of the Issuer to comply with certain procedures._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and is an Italian resident for tax purposes and therefore

payments of principal, issue discount and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the
Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments in respect of Notes will be made free and
clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is required by law. In
that event, subject to a number of exceptions, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will result in the
holders of the Notes receiving such amounts as they would have received in respect of such Notes had no such
withholding or deduction been required. The Issuer is not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of Notes
under certain circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative
Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (“Decree 239”) or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November
21, 1997 (“Decree 461”), except where the procedures required under Decree 239 and Decree 461 in order to
benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents.
In such circumstances, investors subject to Italian withholding tax will only receive the net proceeds of their
investment in the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts” and “Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain Italian Tax Considerations.”_

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian withholding or income substitute tax will not be

imposed under Decree 239 or Decree 461 where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country or
territory which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with the Italian tax authorities as contained (I)
in the Ministerial Decree of the Minister of Economy and Finance of September 4, 1996, as amended or
supplemented from time to time and replaced or (II) once effective, in any other decree or regulation that will be
issued in the future under the authority of Article 11(4)(c) of Decree 239 to provide the list of such countries and
territories (any of such decrees, the “White List”), including any country or territory that will be deemed listed
therein for the purpose of any interim rule and such holder complies with certain certification requirements, there
is no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree
239 after the date hereof, including any change in the White List. Holders of Notes resident in such countries or
in a country allowing for the satisfactory exchange of information with Italy but that do not satisfy the conditions
set forth by Decree 239 (as amended or supplemented), as well as certain categories of holders of the Notes who
are resident in Italy, will only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes. The regime provided by
Decree 239 and, in particular, the exemption from imposta sostitutiva, which is in principle granted to holders of
the Notes resident in countries that allow for satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, is also subject to
certain procedural requirements being met. Should the procedural requirements not be met, Italian _imposta_
_sostitutiva may apply on the payments made on the Notes to foreign investors resident in countries that allow for_
satisfactory exchange of information with Italy. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian Tax
_Considerations.”_

-----

**_No assurance can be given that the Notes will be listed or that, once listed, the listing will be_**

**_maintained or that such listing will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree 239 of April 1, 1996._**

Application will be made to the Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Exchange’s

Euro MTF Market and to be listed on the Official List upon their issuance. There can be no assurance, however,
that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange or that such permission to deal in the Notes will
be granted or that such listing will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned upon obtaining
this listing or permission to list. If the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the Issuer can no
longer maintain such listing or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may
cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange, provided, however, that it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another “recognized stock
**exchange,” although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.**

No assurance can be given that the Notes will be listed or that, once listed, the listing will be maintained

or that any such listing will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to
benefit from the provisions of such legislation relating to the exemption from the requirement to apply
withholding tax. The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among others, the listing
requirement of the aforementioned legislation that may be interpreted to require that the Notes be listed upon their
issuance to benefit from the aforementioned provisions, including the exemption from the requirement to apply
withholding tax. In the event that the Notes are not listed or that such listing requirement is not satisfied, payments
of interest, premium and other income with respect to the Notes would be subject to a withholding tax, currently
at a rate of 26%. The possible imposition of withholding taxes or deduction of taxes with respect to payments on
the Notes and, subject to and as set forth in “Descriptions of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the resulting
obligation to pay additional amounts to holders of the Notes could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

**_A German guarantor may be obliged to withhold on payments to certain investors incorporated,_**

**_established or tax resident in non-cooperative jurisdictions._**

In case an investor is incorporated, established or tax resident in a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht

_kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) within the meaning of the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and Unfair Tax_
Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb) payments of interest or
payments in lieu of interest by a German tax resident (such as payments by a German guarantor) would be subject
to German non-resident taxation (beschränkte Steuerpflicht). A jurisdiction will qualify as non-cooperative if it
fulfils the requirements defined in the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur
_Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb). The requirements defined aim to capture_
jurisdictions that do encourage abusive tax practices and do not comply with international tax standards and are
based on and implement the EU Council’s conclusions on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax
purposes (as updated and amended from time to time) and related defensive measures approved by the EU
Council. The withholding tax obligation under the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and Unfair Tax Competition
(Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb) is applicable as of January 1, 2022.
The withholding tax rate is 15% of the gross payments (plus any applicable solidarity surcharge). Due to a change
in law, no withholding tax will be levied if bearer notes are represented by a global note (Sammelurkunde) and
are held in collective safe custody with a central depositary as well as comparable debt instruments, which are
tradable on a recognized stock exchange. The exact scope of this new exemption, in particular with respect to
registered notes, is, however, unclear.

**_A Dutch guarantor may be obliged to withhold on payments to certain affiliated investors in low-_**

**_taxing states or non-cooperative jurisdictions or in certain defined cases of abuse._**

Dutch withholding tax may apply on certain (deemed) interest due and payable under the guarantee to

an affiliated (gelieerde) entity of a Dutch guarantor if such entity (i) is considered to be resident (gevestigd) in a
jurisdiction that is listed in the yearly updated Dutch Regulation on low-taxing states and non-cooperative
jurisdictions for tax purposes (Regeling laagbelastende staten en niet-coöperatieve rechtsgebieden voor

_belastingdoeleinden), or (ii) has a permanent establishment located in such jurisdiction to which the interest is_
attributable, or (iii) is entitled to the interest payable for the main purpose or one of the main purposes to avoid
taxation of another person, or (iv) is not considered to be the recipient of the interest in its jurisdiction of residence
because such jurisdiction treats another (lower-tier) entity as the recipient of the interest (hybrid mismatch), or
(v) is not treated as resident anywhere (also a hybrid mismatch), or (vi) is a reverse hybrid whereby the jurisdiction
of residence of a higher-tier beneficial owner (achterliggende gerechtigde) that has a qualifying interest
(kwalificerend belang) in the reverse hybrid treats the reverse hybrid as tax transparent and that higher-tier
beneficial owner would have been taxable based on one (or more) of the items in clauses (i)-(v) above had the
interest been due to him directly, all within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021). The Dutch withholding tax rate is 25.8%._

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements to apply the Italian tax regime provided_**

**_by Decree 239 will be met by the relevant foreign intermediaries._**

The regime provided by Decree 239 and in particular the exemption from withholding tax in principle

granted to holders of the Notes resident in White List countries applies if certain procedural requirements are met.
It is not possible to assure that all non-Italian resident investors can claim the application of the withholding tax
exemption where the relevant foreign intermediary fails to provide sufficient information to the relevant Italian
tax authorities under the procedures set for applying the exemption regime. See “Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain Italian Tax Considerations.”_

**_Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the EU financial transaction tax, if adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”)

for a Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“EU FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (the “Participating Member States”). On
December 8, 2015, Estonia indicated that it would no longer be a Participating Member State. The Commission’s
Proposal is still pending before the Council of the EU and its status is regularly discussed at the European and
Financial Affairs Council. Moreover, in the course of 2020, the European Commission brought to the attention
of the Council of the EU and the EU Parliament the possibility to propose, by June 2024, the introduction of a
reshaped EU FTT as a new EU own resource. The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and, if
introduced in its current form, could apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market
transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both

within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes
provided that at least one party to the transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating Member
State and that there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State
which is party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person, or acting
in the name of a party to the transaction. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a
Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person
established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings
is issued in a Participating Member State.

The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It

may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU
Member States may decide to participate and/or other Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If
the Commission’s Proposal or any similar tax were adopted, transactions in the Notes could be subject to higher
costs and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished.

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisers in relation to the consequences of the EU

FTT associated with purchasing and disposing of the Notes.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If

the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their “issue price” by an amount equal to or more than a
statutorily defined de minimis amount, the Notes will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations”), whether on the cash or accrual method of tax accounting, would be_
required to include any amounts representing OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on a constant yield to
maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such
income is attributable. For further discussion, see “Certain Tax Considerations Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations–Original Issue Discount.”_

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the gross proceeds from the Offering will be approximately €590.0 million. Proceeds from

the Offering, will be used, directly or indirectly, to (i) redeem the Existing Notes and pay any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, (ii) repay amounts outstanding under and cancel the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility, including any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

The estimated sources and uses of funds necessary to complete the Transactions are shown in the table below.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the amount of accrued
and unpaid interest due on the Existing Notes and the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility, the relevant date of redemption
and repayment, any original issue discount, our actual cash position as of the Issue Date and differences from our
estimates of fees and expenses. To the extent the gross proceeds from the Offering exceed the amount required
for the uses described below, we may use any excess proceeds for general corporate purposes. Any increase in
the amount required to complete the Transactions compared to our estimates may be funded through other sources
available to the Group, including drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other cash sources.

aggregate principal amount thereof, which will be redeemed by using part of the proceeds of the Notes. The
amount shown in the table above excludes accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date to
the Issue Date as the assumed redemption date, which we expect to pay in connection with the redemption
of the Existing Notes on or about the Issue Date.

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility, which will be

repaid by using part of the proceeds of the Notes. The amount shown in the table above excludes unamortized
costs, break costs and accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date to the Issue Date as the
assumed repayment date, which we expect to pay in connection with the repayment of the Fiskeby
Acquisition Facility on or about the Issue Date. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates
are bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers and lenders with respect to the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility,
and have received, and expect to receive customary fees and commissions for the repayment of the Fiskeby
Acquisition Facility, some of which are payable with proceeds from the issuance of the Notes.

(5) Represents estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including underwriting

fees and commissions, accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes and the Fiskeby Acquisition
Facility, fees and break costs relating to the cancellation of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, financial
advisory costs, legal costs and other transaction costs and professional fees and expenses and to be financed
by the Issuer by using part of the proceeds of the Notes.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Introduction**

This document includes the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of Topco for the

year ended December 31, 2023 and the related explanatory notes (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
**Financial Information”). The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared to**
give pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2023.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not include any pro forma effect

with reference to the issuance of the Notes herby and the application of the net proceeds therefrom.

The purpose of the preparation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is to

simulate, using accounting principles that are consistent with those used in relation to the preparation of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and, in compliance with the
applicable legislation, the main potential effects of the Fiskeby Acquisition on the consolidated income statement
of Topco, as if the Fiskeby Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023 for the purposes of the unaudited pro
forma consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.

It should be noted that a pro forma consolidated statement of financial position has not been prepared,

as the Fiskeby Acquisition was already reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and,

therefore, does not represent the actual results of operations of the Group.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared on a voluntary basis

for inclusion in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial
Information represents a simulation, for illustrative purposes only, of the main potential impacts that may derive
from the Fiskeby Acquisition. In particular, as pro forma information is prepared to illustrate, retrospectively, the
effects of transactions that will occur or occurred subsequently, using generally accepted regulations and
reasonable assumptions, there are limitations that are inherent to the nature of pro forma information; hence, had
the Fiskeby Acquisition taken place on the dates assumed above, the actual effects would not necessarily have
been the same as those presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.

Furthermore, in consideration of the different purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated

Financial Information as compared to the historical financial statements and the different methods of calculation
of the effects of the Fiskeby Acquisition on the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement, the latter two
statements should be read and interpreted without comparisons between them.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is based on current estimates of, and good

faith assumptions regarding, the adjustments arising from the Fiskeby Acquisition. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Financial Information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent or to be
indicative of the consolidated results of operations that the Group would have reported had the Fiskeby
Acquisition been completed as of the date presented, and is not, and should not be taken as, representative of the
Group’s future consolidated results of operations, nor does it purport to project the Group’s results of operations
for any future period and should not be used for such purpose. The unaudited pro forma financial data was not
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information should be read together with:

    - the Topco Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, approved
by the Board of Directors on February 29, 2024 and audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A.
which issued its unqualified audit report on March 8, 2024; and

94


-----

    - the Fiskeby’s consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023, prepared
by the board of directors of Fiskeby.

The pro forma adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information are limited

to those that are (i) directly attributable to the pro forma adjustment related to the Fiskeby Acquisition and (ii)
factually supportable. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not reflect, for
example:

    - any integration costs that may be incurred as a result of the Fiskeby Acquisition;

    - any synergies, operating efficiencies and cost savings that may result from the Fiskeby Acquisition;
or

    - any costs that may be incurred as a result of the Fiskeby Acquisition and to which executive officers
could become entitled to in the future.

**The Fiskeby Acquisition**

On July 13, 2023, the Group finalized the acquisition of 100% of share capital of Fiskeby, which was

deemed effective, for accounting purposes, from July 1, 2023.

The transaction price included an upfront component of €127.5 million, of which €125.3 million paid to

the seller and €2.2 million for bonuses paid to the management of Fiskeby. The transaction price also included
two deferred payments of (i) €4.3 million, due on March 31, 2024, and (ii) €4.3 million, due on March 31, 2025.
The total investment amounted to €136.2 million.

The transaction costs associated with the Fiskeby Acquisition, including financial advisory fees and

other transaction costs and professional expenses recorded in the Company’s consolidated income statement for
the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to €1.8 million.

In order to fund the Fiskeby Acquisition, on July 11, 2023, the Company entered into the Fiskeby

Acquisition Facility. Transaction costs relating to the entry into the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility amounted to €3.3
million.

**Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information**

**_Basis of preparation and accounting policies adopted_**

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is prepared on the basis of the historical

financial information derived from the financial statements and information detailed above, adjusted to simulate
the potential effects of the Fiskeby Acquisition.

The accounting policies adopted in preparing the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial

Information re the same as those used to prepare the Topco Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which
were prepared in accordance with IFRS.

It should be noted that the Fiskeby Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance

with Swedish GAAP and presented in thousands of SEK. Historical data of Fiskeby reflected in the Unaudited
Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information was therefore derived from the consolidated financial statements
of Fiskeby prepared in accordance with Swedish GAAP and, where applicable, have been adjusted through
proforma adjustment in order to adjust them to the IFRS adopted by the Company, as further discussed in this
document.

Furthermore, the pro forma adjustments related to the unaudited pro forma consolidated income

statement have been translated into Euro using an average exchange rate.

Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts in this document are expressed in millions of Euro.

**Description of financial information and pro forma adjustments**

**_Note A –_** This column represents the consolidated income statement of the Company for the year ended

December 31, 2023, derived from the Topco Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The Fiskeby
Acquisition was completed on July 13, 2023 and the historical financial information of Fiskeby was consolidated
by the Group starting from July 1, 2023.

**_Note B1 - This table sets forth the methodology for calculating the pro forma adjustments to illustrate_**

_Note (a1)_

This column reflects the conversion of the presentation currency from SEK to Euro through the use of an
average exchange rate.

_Note (a2)_

This column includes the adjustments to the Fiskeby Group’s consolidated historical financial information
to comply with IFRS, consistent with the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the
adjustments made to simulate the main effects of applying IFRS are as follow:

    - The effects of the application of IFRS 10 to the consolidation of a subsidiary which own the
warehouse called Fiskeby 1:73.

    - The effects of the application of IFRS 16 to hiring and rental contracts owned by Fiskeby.

    - The effects of the application of IFRS 9 to financial derivates. Based on IFRS 9, derivatives shall
be measured at fair value thought profit and loss and according to the market value a gain of €3.0
million has been recognized in the income statement.

(b) This column includes the Fiskeby Group’s contribution to the Company’s consolidated income statement for

the year ended December 31, 2023 as included in the Topco Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_B2 - This column includes the pro forma adjustments to reflect:_**

99


-----

    - the elimination of (i) the transaction costs incurred in relation to the Fiskeby Acquisition, amounting
to €1.8 million and (ii) the related tax effect of €0.5 million (based on IRES of 24.0% and IRAP of
3.9%); and

    - the interest expense of €0.3 million, gross of the related tax effect that is estimated to be €0.1 million
(based on IRES of 24.0%), relating to the unwinding of the deferred payment amounts for the
Fiskeby Acquisition (consisting of (i) €4.3 million due on March 31, 2024, and (ii) €4.3 million due
on March 31, 2025), applying a discount rate of 8.1%, determined by calculating the amortized cost
of such deferred payment amount at an internal rate of return of 8.1% (equal to the sum of six-month
EURIBOR plus 5.25%).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not reflect any adjustments relating

to the purchase price allocation as the exercise to determine the fair value of the net assets acquired has still to be
completed as of the date of preparation of this Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. The difference
between the acquisition price and the net assets acquired has been, in fact, allocated to goodwill on a provisional
basis. This accounting is in accordance with IFRS 3 – Business Combination, Paragraph 45, which provides that
if the fair value of the net assets acquired is not available at the date of preparation of the financial statements,
goodwill should be determined on a provisional basis and the final purchase price allocation shall be completed
within 12 months from the acquisition date.

The completion of the purchase price allocation exercise in accordance with IFRS 3 will result in the

recognition, at the date of acquisition, of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities or contingent liabilities
assumed arising from the Fiskeby Acquisition at fair value, including the relevant deferred tax, where applicable,
with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Therefore, the Group’s statement of income may also be affected,
even to a significant extent, by the amount of fair value that will be allocated to Fiskeby Group’s assets and
liabilities or contingent liabilities.

**_B3_**     - This column includes the effects on the Group’s income statement of the Fiskeby Acquisition

Facility. The following table sets forth the calculation of the net impact:

**Amount**

_(in € millions)_

Reversal of finance costs of the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility[(a)] ........................................................ 4.7

Finance expenses on the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility[(b)] ................................................................... (8.5)

Tax effect (IRES 24.0%) ................................................................................................................... 0.9

**Net impact ........................................................................................................................................** **(2.9)**

(a) Relates to the elimination of finance expenses for the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility, as recorded in the Topco Audited

Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b) Relates to estimated finance expenses for the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility, calculated on an amortized cost basis on the

assumption that the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility had been issued on January 1, 2023. The effective interest rate on the
Fiskeby Acquisition Facility has been assumed to be 8.3%, taking also into account the expenses associated.

**Overview**

We are a leading European producer and distributor of recycled cartonboard, active in the coated and

uncoated recycled cartonboard industry. We operate in the WLC and SB market segments, in each case with a
demonstrated track record of making our operations more sustainable as both WLC and SB are manufactured
from recovered paper and we actively invest in our operations to reduce emissions, waste, water usage and other
environmental factors. Our cartonboard can be used as both primary and secondary packaging. Our WLC products
are predominantly used, without limitation, in packaging for the food, hygiene and cleaning, pharmaceuticals and
healthcare, electronics, textile and toy industries. Our SB products are mostly used for the packaging of luxury
goods, publishing applications (bookbinding), as well as for graphical applications, such as for puzzles and games.

Our identity is built on a clear vision centered on the circular economy that guides our activities as a

manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, and that represents a balanced combination between our
business and the expectations of our stakeholders; see also “Business—Our Production Process—Circular
_Business Model.” Our ambition is to be the partner of choice of all key stakeholders with three strategic goals in_
mind: to offer excellent products and services, to optimize costs and to maximize the satisfaction of our customers,
all while helping drive increased sustainability within the paper and packaging industry.

As of December 31, 2023, we served our customers through a network of ten mills (including

Blendecques), four sheeting and distribution centers, and 13 sales offices. As of December 31, 2023, we employed
over 2,520 employees.

We believe that our geographical footprint across Europe and exposure to resilient end-markets (such as

the food end-market) are key strengths of our business, which we have reinforced through the recent Fiskeby
Acquisition in 2023 (in addition to Eska and Paprinsa Acquisitions in 2021). Our position as a leader in the
European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills, our “multi-mill” concept, whereby we
seek to be able to offer similar cartonboard products at different mills whenever possible, helping us meet our
customers’ demands quickly regardless of their proximity to a specific production site, and guarantee security of

101


-----

supply to our entire customer base. Our distributed mill network is integrated by our “One Company” operating
model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and
sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent.

    - **_WLC. In our WLC market segment, we produce cartonboard from recycled fibers for folding carton_**
and corrugated packaging applications. According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data provided
by a global management consulting company, we are the largest non-integrated WLC producer
(based on annual production capacity as of December 31, 2023), with a market share of
approximately 27% for the year ended December 31, 2023 (after giving _pro forma_ effect to the
Fiskeby Acquisition) by volumes sold, in a rather consolidated European market. In terms of
production capacity, WLC represents approximately 79% of our business as of December 31, 2023
(giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition).

    - We had a total WLC production capacity of 1,350 thousand tons per year for the year ended
December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) of which 110 thousand
tons was attributable to our Blendecques mill, which we are planning to close by the second half of
2024 as discussed further under “Summary—Recent Developments—Closure of the Blendecques
_mill.”_

    - **_SB. In our SB market segment, we produce SB from recycled fibers for packaging and graphical_**
applications. We had a total production capacity of 360 thousand tons per year for the year ended
December 31, 2023. In terms of production capacity, SB represents approximately 21% of our
business as of December 31, 2023. We are a leading SB producer with a global reach. Following
the Eska Acquisition, we now have three industry-leading SB production facilities (in terms of
production capacity) across The Netherlands and Italy, with the largest SB production capacity
among participants in the core market segments in which Eska operates (which include luxury
packaging, bookbinding, puzzles and games) for the year ended December 31, 2023.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Fiskeby

Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023), we generated Adjusted Pro Forma Revenues from Sales of
€844.6 million and Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of €157.7 million (representing a margin of 18.7%)
and we sold approximately 1,018 thousand tons (excluding Blendecques). The charts below present the
breakdown of our tons sold by geography, by relevant end-market and by product, in each case for the year ended
December 31, 2023. The following graphs show tons sold splits of the Group (after giving pro forma affect to the
Fiskeby Acquisition).

-----

As of December 31, 2023 (after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition), we served over

2,500 customers across our WLC and SB market segments and sold our products, either directly or indirectly, in
over 100 countries worldwide.

We remain united by our “One Company” culture and philosophy and believe that the size of our network

and breadth of our geographical footprint give us significant competitive advantages, including greater
operational flexibility to serve our customers and manufacture our products across our network of mills, as well
as enhanced capacity to supply our products in a timely manner and the flexibility to produce our products at
more than one mill. While our network of nine paper mills is strategically located to best serve our pan-European
customer base, which requires localized service, our operations remain integrated. We centrally manage
operations, and we are currently enhancing our ability to integrate operations across our network by implementing
the same ERP systems in all of our mills. Additionally, improvements to our IT resources have allowed, and we
believe we will continue to allow, us to balance the availability of products across our network of mills, to
optimize profitability and proximity to customers, to protect their security of supply and to mitigate the risks
posed by market volatility arising from changes in the supply and demand dynamics in local markets. Over the
last two years, we have pursued a broad array of technology initiatives including the creation of sophisticated
digital applications to deliver high-quality and innovative products across the entire value chain as well as the
roll-out of a comprehensive digital transformation program aimed at achieving efficiencies through all areas of
the Group, including projects on operations, logistics, procurement, human resources, sales, planning and health
and safety. Key IT products include the internal tools for corporate management performance, managerial
reporting, human capital management and portfolio project management. We will continue to implement
technological development initiatives to pursue our lean manufacturing philosophy, including through new
analytic initiatives to enhance quality integration, procurement, pricing and supply chain savings.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations**

The following section provides a description of the main factors that have affected our financial

condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, as well as certain
factors which may impact the financial condition and results of operations in the future.

**_Increasing sustainability trends_**

Interest in sustainability has increased over the past decade and accelerated in recent years and we expect

that sustainability trends will play an increasing role in our customers’ and consumers’ purchasing decisions.
There have been continuous and increasing concerns about the environmental impact of single-use products and
products made from plastic across various industries, including the food, homecare, beverage, cosmetics and
pharmaceutical industries. In response to such concerns, EU and national governmental authorities have been
implementing legislations aimed at reducing the amount of plastic and other waste incapable of being reused,
recycled or composted, including the packaging and packaging waste directive (“PPWD”). See “Industry—WLC
_Industry Fundamentals—Legislation.” In addition, some companies have responded to these regulatory changes_
by reducing the level of single-use plastic packaging waste in their products, shifting towards more recyclable
and sustainable products. Such trends positively correlate with our business, production plans, innovation efforts
around sustainability and could increase demand for certain of our products. We believe that we are well
positioned to benefit from growth in fiber-based, recyclable packaging, as we already positively and directly
contribute to the circular economy of recycled fibers. In addition, our acquisition of Fiskeby, which produces
multiboard products made from 100% recyclable fiber, underlines our commitment to environment-friendly
manufacturing and outputs.

We intend to continue our innovation and product development efforts to ensure that we are at the leading

edge of recyclability in order to offer our customers increasingly sustainable options. Substantially all of our
revenues from sales were derived from products made with recycled, recyclable and renewable materials for the
periods presented and we expect to incur additional capital expenditures and research and development costs for
the development of products for new applications, while strictly maintaining the essential feature of recyclability
of our existing more sustainable products.

**_The pass through of price fluctuations of raw materials and energy (mainly natural gas) into the sales_**

**_prices for our products_**

Our production process is heavily based on raw materials, such as PfR, recycled paper, and energy. As

such, our results of operations are impacted by fluctuations in the price of raw materials and energy, which drive
changes in the selling price of products. The prices of raw materials may fluctuate due to external conditions
outside our control, including weather conditions, product scarcity, commodity market fluctuations, inflation
levels, as well as changes in governmental policies and regulation.

In recent years, several global trends caused a significant increase in the prices of our raw materials and

energy (mainly natural gas). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a fiber shortage in Europe due to
lower collection rates and shutdowns of recycling plants as a result of the governmental restrictions. Moreover,
since 2022 the war in Ukraine disrupted the energy and natural gas markets in Europe and the volatility of energy
prices caused subsequent inflationary pressures, which in turn increased the prices of our other inputs, such as
recycled fibers or paper for recycling. As a result, the cost of raw materials and services have increased and
represented 73.0%, 76.4% and 82.6% of our revenues from sales for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022
and 2021, respectively, with raw materials and, to a lesser extent, energy (mainly natural gas, as electricity
utilization remains limited due to high energy self-sufficiency of the mills), being the most significant
components. In particular, the cost of raw materials represented 50.5%, 48.2% and 55.0%, and energy costs
represented 21.5%, 29.0% and 21.4%, of our total cost of raw materials and services for the years ended December
31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Purchases of most of our raw materials are based on negotiated rates with suppliers, which are tied to

published indices. Historically, we have not entered into long-term purchase contracts that provide for fixed
quantities or prices for our principal raw materials. In Italy, we are a member of the National Consortium for the
Recovery and Recycling of Cellulose-based Packaging (Comieco) and such membership grants us certain
guaranteed supply quantities of fibers at a fair market price.

The prices for some of our raw materials, particularly scrap paper (from which recycled fiber is made),

have fluctuated in recent years. Wastepaper is typically purchased from sources close to our mills and, as a result,
prices are established locally based on factors such as demand levels and local competitive conditions. The price
of wastepaper is also affected by demand levels in other industries, particularly containerboard where recent
demand has been strong, and future demand is expected to remain strong, driven by the significant growth in ecommerce.

Our raw material purchases primarily consist of recycled fibers, PfR, wood pulp, and chemicals. Brown

grades make up the majority of our purchases, followed to a lesser extent by white grades and wood pulp. The
average cost per ton of recycled fibers increased from €185/ton in July 2021 to €249/ton in July 2022, and
decreased to 154€/ton in 2023. The increase in the average cost of recycled fibers from 2021 to 2022 has resulted
in an overall increase in our sales prices averages over the same period. However, we have managed to increase
our sales prices more than proportionally above the increase in the cost of recycled fibers, thus helping to increase
our contribution margin, as well as implementing operational efficiencies. Additionally, we use various strategies
to manage cost exposure on certain raw material purchases with the goal of achieving more predictable costs and,
from time to time, we enter into fixed price contracts as hedging arrangements for some of our raw materials to
minimize the impact of price fluctuations. For example, we hedged approximately 16% of our estimated
electricity needs for 2024 and approximately 46% of our estimated natural gas needs for 2024.

We try to pass through increases in the price of our raw materials and energy to our customers.

Conversely, our customers generally expect price reductions when our input costs decrease. Historically, we did
not have clauses for the automatic pass through of input costs in our sales contracts, but we were generally able
to pass price increases through the regular renegotiation of contracts with our customers. Due to differences in
timing between purchases of raw materials and sales to customers, there is often a lead-lag effect, during which
margins are negatively impacted in the short term when raw material costs increase and positively impacted in
the short term when raw material costs decrease. Historically, the average lag time in implementing raw material

104


-----

cost pass through mechanisms has been approximately two or three months depending on the size of the order
backlog at a given point in time; however, to improve our ability to pass price increases on to our customers we
updated our pricing methodology in late 2021 to allow us to increase our product prices at the time of delivery as
opposed to the time of order, which has significantly reduced the time discrepancy between the increases in raw
material prices and the selling prices of our products. Historically, we have been successful in passing on price
increases to our customers as presented in the following graph showing our successful historical prices increase
since January 2021.

(1) Average price across RDM mills and Paprinsa.

(2) Price considering Eska only.

Our pricing structure helps us sustain low volatility in PfR prices and we believe that they will be on a

decreasing trend throughout first quarter of 2024, followed by a rebound in second half of the year on the back of
higher level of manufacturing activities as shown in the following graph.

Changes in energy prices are not as easily passed through to our sales prices, unless they are significant,

and therefore fluctuations in energy prices may cause short term margin fluctuations. In order to reduce the
volatility of our natural gas consumption costs, which represents our main energy cost, starting from 2022 we

105


-----

purchased approximately 68% of our natural gas volumes using fixed-price contracts and approximately 32% of
our natural gas volumes at spot rates or with short-term coverage. We implemented this policy in 2022 in order
to mitigate the increased volatility of the natural gas price due to the conflict in Ukraine. In 2023, natural gas price
returned to almost the same levels as before the beginning of conflict and we purchased approximately 59% of
our natural gas volumes using fixed-price contracts and approximately 41% of our natural gas volumes at spot
rates or with short-term hedging term to limit exposure to energy price volatility. In addition, in 2022 we
completed investments to improve our energy consumption such as the installation of a new boiler at the Santa
Giustina mill, which allows for more efficient production of steam for manufacturing, a new high-efficiency
cogeneration plant in Ovaro site and a new washing machine in our Barcelona mill that helps us to reduce waste
and improve quality and energy efficiency. We have also started building a new co-generation plant in Barcelona
to further reduce our carbon emissions and expect its completion in second quarter of 2024. See also “—Cost
_efficiency initiatives.” Lastly, in times of strong energy price volatility, such as the second half of 2022, we were_
able to implement an energy surcharge price mechanism to automatically passthrough increases in energy costs
to customers.

From November 2023, natural gas futures price lowered on the back of (i) constant mild climate and (ii)

restored liquefied natural gas supply and demand. In Europe, these trends led in the first two months of 2024 to
more than 50% availability of gas storage capacity (compared to 35% based on 10-year average). The trend of
the natural gas price between 2020 and 2024 is illustrated in the following graph:

**_Macroeconomic environment and market trends_**

Our business is exposed to general macroeconomic environment risks that are beyond our control, such

as general macroeconomic conditions, volatility in the global capital and credit markets (including in the European
sovereign debt market), geopolitical events and other general political and economic developments globally and
in the markets in which we operate. Demand for our products, which was primarily driven by demand for our
customers’ end-products, such as industrial and consumer packaging, closely follows global economic conditions.
Sustained economic downturns characterized by declines in consumer and government spending, business
investment or construction activity typically result in decreased demand for various forms of packaging which,
in turn, could negatively affect the demand for our products.

Recent years have been challenging for the world economy, due in part to political turmoil and/or

upheaval in a number of regions, which has resulted in high currency volatility and tumultuous markets, and
significantly impacted demand for our products. In particular, in 2021 and 2022, the rapid improvement in global
economic conditions following the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened international tensions and
macroeconomic concerns due to the conflict in Ukraine resulted in the implementation by our customers of

106


-----

aggressive stocking policies to secure higher levels of inventories to meet expected market demand and address
supply chain uncertainty, which resulted in record demand for our products. Conversely, in 2023, several
macroeconomic factors, including a persisting inflationary environment and material increases in global interest
rates were among the factors that, alongside above-average stock levels, led our customers to implement destocking policies to decrease the level of our products held in stock primarily to realign inventories to historical
levels, which resulted in lower demand for our products in 2023. See “—Competitive environment and changes
_in consumer.”_

We mainly operate in the WLC market segment, a type of coated paperboard made from recycled

materials. Sales of WLC products represented approximately 81%, 77%, and 78% of our sales for the years ended
December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition), 2022 and 2021, respectively. In
2023, demand for WLC products based on volumes declined in France (-28%), declined in Germany (-27%),
declined in Spain (-28%), declined in Italy (-29%), in each case, compared to 2021. The overall decrease in
demand for WLC products was mainly driven by a cycle of de-stocking by customers, who accumulated
inventories during 2022 due to expected disruptions in the global supply chain after COVID-19 and other paper
industry dynamics, such as the substitution between paper grades and the impact of the conflict in Ukraine.

Following the Eska Acquisition in 2021, we increased the capacity of our SB sector, and SB products

evolved from a minor part of our portfolio to representing a key component of our product offering. The SB
market segment is primarily used for luxury packaging, publishing applications (bookbinding) as well as for
graphical applications, such as for puzzles and games. Sales of SB products represented approximately 19%, 23%,
and 23% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**_Competitive environment and changes in consumer demand_**

While we have maintained our overall market share, our business experienced weak demand across all

regions and segments in 2023, which reflects an industry-wide trend that we believe was due primarily to the
customer de-stocking cycle that affected our entire value chain, together with other dynamics in the paper industry
such as the substitution among grades and the impact of the Ukrainian conflict. Starting in 2021 and 2022, we
have experienced significant stocking and de-stocking dynamics, which resulted in a divergence of patterns
between consumption by our customers, on the one hand, and supply dynamics in our product end-markets, on
the other hand. In particular, in 2021 and 2022, we experienced increased stocking by many of our customers,
which was primarily driven by their need to secure higher levels of inventories to meet expected market demand
and address supply chain uncertainty caused by macroeconomic concerns and COVID-19. Such stocking
dynamics have driven an increase in the demand for our products during 2021 and 2022. As a result of the market
dynamics, as well as our recent acquisitions, our revenues from sales increased from €803.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to €1,222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Conversely, in 2023, demand softness was primarily driven by a customer de-stocking cycle after

customers built up their inventories during 2022 due to anticipated global supply chain disruptions after COVID19. Other dynamics influenced the paper industry such as substitution among grades and impact of the conflict in
Ukraine, as well as entering of new competitors in European market. As a result of the above trends, almost all
paper producers in Europe suffered reductions in revenues and volumes, which led to implement price corrections.
This, in turn, drove a contraction in our sales revenues, which decreased by 34.7% in the year ended December
31, 2023 compared to the 2022. While we believe the de-stocking trends that we experienced in 2023 have been
largely driven by temporary contingencies, are largely complete and are not a recurring trend in our industry, any
such fluctuations may persist longer than we expect or may reoccur in the near future, particularly where periods
of significant increase in demand for end-products are followed closely by periods of elevated costs of capital,
unstable macroeconomic conditions and persisting inflation, which could negatively impact our sales volumes
and results of operations and increased capacity from manufacturers in Europe and Turkey. We believe the destocking trend has now ended as the stock of WLC in the European market is the first months of 2024 is very low,
and we have seen our order intake increase year-over-year for the first two months of 2024.

Despite a soft market in 2023, our strategic activities, successful pricing strategy and capacity

management protected our margins. While revenues from sales decreased from €1,222.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to €798.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to a reduction in volumes,
EBITDA margin remained substantially stable (16.5% in 2022 compared to 16.6% in 2023 inclusive of the
insurance reimbursement received for fire and relevant damages occurred at the Blendecques mill. See “—
_Blendecques and Villa Santa Lucia mills”)._

**_Blendecques and Villa Santa Lucia mills_**

Our Blendecques mill was shut down from March 22, 2022 as a result of a fire that occurred due to

causes outside our control. Although the fire materially impacted various areas of the plant, causing operations to
cease, no one was injured or killed. We estimated that the fire and the subsequent business interruption led to a
reduction in production volumes of approximately 22,000 tons in 2022 and approximately 60,000 tons in 2023,
assuming the same demand level recorded at the other mills of the Group over the same period. In February 2023,
the Blendecques mill’s carton machine was partly restarted. In 2022, we received a €3.1 million insurance
reimbursement related to the fire and in 2023 we received €44.8 million of insurance reimbursements. The
Blendecques mill was fully operational in September 2023, but it was temporarily shut down again due to flooding
at the end of 2023 and as a result it was not able to ramp up operations as expected.

The Blendecques mill has historically underperformed vis-à-vis the other Group’s mills. Since 2016, it

has primarily been a loss generating business, achieving positive EBITDA only in 2019 and 2020. Despite the
investments as part of the reconstruction process, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it remains
unprofitable.

In order to address the continued underperformance of the Blendecques mill, we are currently

considering strategic alternatives and currently intend to cease operations at the Blendecques mill by the second
half of 2024. We believe the closure of this mill will improve our profitability, optimize our industrial footprint
and allow us to more efficiently adapt our current mill capacity to temporary changes in demand dynamics for
cartonboard that resulted in mitigating pricing pressures in 2023.

We estimate that we will incur approximately €20 million of one-off costs in connection with the closure

of the mill, which we believe that we will recover by 2025 by selling related assets and utilizing our more
profitable mills for what was previously produced in the Blendecques mill. In the long-term, we believe that the
closure of the Blendecques mill will have a positive impact on our results of operations and Adjusted EBITDA,
and free cash flow. In particular, we expect that in the long-term the closure of the Blendecques will result in an
annual positive impact on our Adjusted EBITDA of between approximately €5 million and approximately €10
million.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Blendecques mill generated revenues of €9.3

million and an EBITDA loss of €14.7 million. The results of operations from the Blendecques mill will be
classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements starting from January 1, 2024. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—Closure of the Blendecques mill.”

From August 2022 to December 2022 the Villa Santa Lucia mill was on standstill following a decision

from the local public prosecutor’s office. During this period, the mill performed extraordinary maintenance
activities and specific investments to enhance the efficiency of the internal biological treatment. In January 2023,
the Villa Santa Lucia mill restarted but public authorities ordered the seizure of the sewage treatment plant serving
the paper mill due to alleged environmental pollution in July 2023. Similarly to the first standstill, we cooperated
with local authorities and we believe that we proved that our mill did not commit any environmental malpractice
towards the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Following extensive discussions with local authorities, on
March 4, 2024, the Villa Santa Lucia mill resumed operations. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Re_opening of the Villa Santa Lucia mill.”_

108


-----

We estimate that these events led to a production decrease of approximately 30,000 tons in 2022 and

74,000 tons in 2023, assuming the same demand level experienced in the other mills of the Group over the same
period. As a result, we have adjusted our Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 to
reflect the normalization of the results of the Villa Santa Lucia mill, consisting of €51.8 million of unrealized
revenues that we expect we would have generated from its operations as if the mill had been fully operational for
the year ended December 31, 2023 less variable and fixed costs. “Summary Financial and Other Information.”

**_Acquisitions, disposals and other transactions affecting our scope of consolidation and comparability_**

**_of our results of operations_**

Consistent with our ongoing strategy of focusing on potential acquisition activities that offer us a broader

range of products and business opportunities, we have engaged in a series of acquisitions, which have expanded
the scope of our product offerings and presence in geographic regions. We believe we can leverage our existing
industry and operational expertise to identify such acquisition opportunities and enhance profitability of the
acquired business. During the period under review, we have also completed certain disposals to increase the focus
on our core business. Such acquisitions and disposals have impacted the comparability of our results of operations.

We completed the La Rochette Disposal in April 2021, implementing our strategic decision to exit the

folding box board segment. An impairment loss from disposal of €1.7 million was recognized in Topco’s 2021
audited consolidated financial statements. We completed the Paprinsa Acquisition on July 1, 2021, as a part of
our strategy to enhance our leadership position and capabilities in the European coated chipboard sector, and
started consolidating the Paprinsa group into our Group’s results from such date. Therefore, our results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, included six months of the Paprinsa group’s results, while our
results of operations in 2022 and 2023 included the Paprinsa group’s results for the entire period. The contribution
of the Paprinsa group to our EBITDA was €3.1 million in 2021, representing six months of its operations, €18.2
million in 2022 and €6.5 million in 2023.

We completed the Eska Acquisition on July 13, 2021, to strategically expand our capabilities in the SB

sector, and started consolidating the Eska Group from such date. Therefore, our results of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2021 included approximately six months of the Eska Group, while our results of operations
in 2022 and 2023 included the Eska Group for the entire year. The contribution to our EBITDA of the Eska Group
was €7.2 million in 2021 from the date of the Eska Acquisition, €41.1 million in 2022 and €16.6 million in 2023.

We completed the Fiskeby Acquisition on July 13, 2023. This acquisition allowed us to grow our market

share in the recycled cartonboard market, enhance the security of our supply and our visibility on volumes,
achieve geographical diversification towards northern Europe, reinforce our multi-mill approach, improve our
cost structure, our competitiveness towards and our exposure to the food segment as well as support our longterm strategy to pursue sustainability and recyclability across our product portfolio. We started consolidating
Fiskeby Group from July 1, 2023. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, therefore,
include six months of Fiskeby Group operations. The contribution to our EBITDA of Fiskeby Group was €8.6
million in 2023, representing six months of its operations. Since September 2023, we have started to
systematically integrate Fiskeby Group. We believe that the acquisition of Fiskeby will generate significant
synergies while enabling us to expand our geographical reach and customer base.

See the section entitled “Our Business—Our History” below for additional information relating to our

recent acquisitions and disposals. Although we believe our approach to acquisitions has helped to grow our
business during the period under review, acquisitions involve certain risks. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_our Business and Industry—The failure to make successful mergers and acquisitions and divestments could have_
_a negative impact on our competitiveness. Additional acquisitions may also expose us to new liabilities.”_

**_Cost efficiency and improvement initiatives_**

During the periods under review, we have identified various cost-saving and improvement initiatives

that have had a positive effect on our results of operations and that could further booster our profitability in the
coming years. These initiatives include:

    - Investing and implementing operational excellence plans in our mills with the goal of improving
operational efficiencies from machinery upgrades and new equipment, ensuring better quality and
higher production volumes, decreasing variable costs and reducing waste. As of December 31, 2023,
we realized €4.1 million of aggregated synergies through these initiatives, out of €18.8 million of
aggregated synergies identified expected to be generated in full by the end of 2028.

    - Dedicating capital expenditures to energy use management, including investments in co-generation
plants and other energy equipment, as the majority of our capital expenditures are spent on energyrelated items and energy is a material driver of our cost structure. As of December 31, 2023, we
realized €5.6 million of aggregated synergies through these initiatives, out of €20.3 million of
aggregated synergies identified and expected to be generated in full by 2028.

    - Implementing our lean manufacturing philosophy by investing in digital tools, such as process
analytics, maintenance, quality integration, procurement, pricing, and supply chain saving through
digitalization. As of December 31, 2023, we realized €2.5 million of aggregated cost savings
through these initiatives, out of €3.7 million of aggregated cost savings and expected to be generated
in full by the end 2024.

    - Developing commercial and cost synergies with the recently acquired Paprinsa, Eska and Fiskeby
businesses, including (i) with respect to Paprinsa, through recipe optimization as well as
procurement, labor, energy efficiencies to increment sales and volumes, (ii) with respect to Eska
Group, through price alignment, portfolio optimization, value engineering as well as capacity
increase, and (iii) with respect to Fiskeby Group, through price re-positioning, cross-selling,
alignment of the overall equipment effectiveness to the Group and sustainable value generation. We
believe that the positive impact of Fiskeby Group integration may produce up to €8.0 million of
synergies through commercial improvements (up to €4.5 million), enhancement of operations and
value engineering (up to €1.5 million) and integration of procurement and organization structures
into the Group (up to €1 million each). As of December 31, 2023, we realized €15.0 million of
aggregated cost savings and synergies through these initiatives, out of €23.0 million of aggregated
cost savings and synergies identified and expected to be generated in full by 2028.

_2023 vs 2022_

Revenues from sales decreased by €423.9 million, or 34.7%, to €798.4 million for the year ended

December 31, 2023 compared to €1,222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was
primarily attributable to the contraction of market demand. The Group has not experienced significant losses in
market share, as the weakness in demand was mainly due to a cycle of de-stocking by customers, who have built
up their inventories during 2021 and 2022 due to expected disruptions in the global supply chain after COVID19, and other paper industry dynamics, such as substitution between paper grades and the impact of the Russia Ukraine conflict. As a result, nearly all paper manufacturers in Europe have experienced reductions in revenues
and volumes, which led to price corrections.

Revenues from sales decreased in all three of the Group’s major geographical areas: in Italy by €106.7

million or 34.6%, to €201.3 million on December 31, 2023 compared to €308.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (ii) in the European Union by €223.3 million, or 31.7%, to €480.5 million on December 31,
2023 compared to €703.8 million for year ended December 31, 2022, and (iii) in the Rest of the world by €93.9
million, or 44.6%, to €116.6 million on December 31, 2023 compared to €210.5 million for year ended December
31, 2022.

_2022 vs 2021_

Revenues from sales increased by €419.1 million, or 52.2%, to €1,222.3 million for the year ended

December 31, 2022 compared to €803.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was
primarily attributable to (i) €232.5 million related to the change in the consolidation perimeter and, in particular,
to the effects of the Eska Acquisition of €155.1 million and the Paprinsa Acquisition of €77.4 million, which were
both consolidated from July 2021, and (ii) for the remaining portion, the increase in market prices that more than
offset the reduction in volumes. In particular, volumes of the Group decreased from 1,274 thousand tons sold in
2021 to 1,216 thousand tons sold in 2022 (that led to a production decrease of 58 thousand tons), or a 4.6%
reduction. However, the Group was able to offset the loss in volumes due to Blendecques and Villa Santa Lucia
mills being shut down (that led to a production decrease of 154 thousand tons) with the increase in production by
Eska and Paprinsa (that led to a production increase of 165 thousand tons), which in 2022 contributed to the
Group performance over the full year, while in 2021 their production was consolidated only for six months.
Notwithstanding the slight decrease in volumes, in the first half of 2022 revenues from sales were positively
impacted by the increases in selling prices implemented during 2021.

Revenues from sales increased in all three of the Group’s major geographical areas: in Italy by €82.7

million, or 36.7%, to €308.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to €225.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021, (ii) in the European Union by €263.4 million, or 59.8%, to €703.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022 compared to €440.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and (iii) in
the Rest of the world by €73.0 million, or 53.1%, to €210.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
compared to €137.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

December 31, 2023 compared to €59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was mainly
due to the reimbursement from the insurance for the fire occurred at the Blendecques mill of €44.8 million and
the increase in other revenues of €9.4 million primarily due greater sales of CO2 emission rights of €5.7 million,
partially offset by a decrease in energy revenues and grants for €23.2 million.

_2022 vs 2021_

Other revenues and income amounted to €59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared

to €17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, with an increase of €41.9 million (or over 100%), mainly
attributable to (i) the extraordinary contribution for energy-intensive businesses received in 2022 from the Italian
government in order to mitigate the effects of energy price increases (€22.8 million) and (ii) the increase in energy
revenues of €18.2 million driven by compensation received from certain energy suppliers based on contractual
arrangements under which we accept a certain level of interruption of energy services, as well as, the sale of
electricity and from energy efficiency certificates (white certificates).

_2023 vs 2022_

Total cost of raw materials and services decreased by €351.1 million, or 37.6%, to €583.0 million for

the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to €934.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in the price of wastepaper and the Group’s main energy sources,
namely natural gas, electricity and coal.

Service costs decrease by €195.6 million, from €483.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to

€288.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in
(i) energy costs of €145.9 million and in (ii) transport costs of €27.0 million. This trend was a consequence of the
contraction of market demand which led to lower production volumes.

_2022 vs 2021_

Total cost of raw materials and services increased by €271.0 million, or 40.9%, to €934.1 million for the

year ended December 31, 2022 from €663.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was
primarily attributable to (i) the change in the consolidation perimeter of €155.3 million due to the Eska Acquisition
and the Paprinsa Acquisition, which were both completed in July 2021 and (ii) to the increase in the price for
recycled fibers and other materials used in production and energy in 2022.

Service costs increased by €185.4 million, from €298.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021

to €483.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly due the change in the

Other operating costs increased by €2.2 million to €6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022

compared to €4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change is mainly due to the increase in
taxes and other indirect taxes and write-down of current receivables, partially offset by decrease in other operating
cost.

Depreciation and amortization increased by €32.3 million to €67.2 million for the year ended December

31, 2022 compared to €34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily
attributable to the changes to the scope of consolidation of €14.3 million and to the effects of the purchase price
allocation related to the RDM Acquisition.

**_Write-downs and revaluations_**

_2023 vs 2022_

Write-downs increased by €1.3 million or 15.7% to €9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023

December 31, 2023 compared to €32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The item primarily
included the interest related to the Existing Notes of €38.0 million and the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility of €4.2
million. The change is mainly due to the increase of the market interest rates during the period.

_2022 vs 2021_

Net financial expense increased by €27.7 million, to €32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022

compared to €4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is mainly due to the interest
expenses on the Existing Notes and other loans in the amount of €31.5 million.

**_Taxes_**

_2023 vs 2022_

Taxes amounted to a positive value of €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to

a negative value of €22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change is mainly attributable to the
decrease in taxable income of the group companies and to the possibility to utilize tax losses carried forward from
BidCo and not deducted in previous years, that reduced the amount of taxes to be paid in 2023 by €7.4 million.

_2022 vs 2021_

Taxes increased by €22.8 million to €22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to

zero million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is attributable to an increase in taxable income
of the group companies.

compared to €202.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the lower consumer demand in line
with the market trend, while EBITDA Margin remained substantially stable.

_2022 vs 2021_

EBITDA increased by €167.9 million, to €202.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared

to €34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. EBITDA Margin increased to 16.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2022 from 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to
(i) the several price increases implemented to pass through raw materials and energy incremental costs and (ii) to
the change in the consolidation perimeter of €48.9 million due to the Eska Acquisition and the Paprinsa
Acquisition.

**_Liquidity_**

**_Overview_**

Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations and cash proceeds from financing

activities. Cash flows from financing activities have in the past included, among others, the net proceeds from the
Existing Notes, drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, leasing and short-term loans under local
facilities. Our uses of cash include general working capital and operational needs, funding capital expenditures
and meeting its debt service requirements. We actively monitor our available liquidity to ensure it will be
sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term cash needs, and we monitor our working capital requirements to
ensure excess cash is not tied up in working capital.

In connection with the Offering and to further support our liquidity, on March 21, 2024, we entered into

the Revolving Credit Facility, which provides borrowings of up to €100 million and will mature on the date falling
six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be cancelled
on the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements.” As a result, following
completion of the Transactions, our main sources of liquidity to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our
liquidity needs will be cash generated from our operating activities, drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility
and certain local facilities.

Following the Transactions our cash requirements will mainly consist of the following:

    - operating activities, including our net working capital requirements and purchasing raw materials
and semi-finished products;

    - servicing our indebtedness and the interest payments thereon, including the Notes offered hereby
and the Revolving Credit Facility;

    - funding capital expenditures; and

    - paying taxes and other expenses.

As of December 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, the amount of our total financial debt

is €646 million.

(*) For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 interest paid has been reclassified from Cash flow from operating

activities to Cash flow from/(used) in financing activities.

**_Cash flow from/(used in) operating activities_**

_2023 vs 2022_

Cash flow generated by operating activities was €131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,

an increase of €7.0 million compared to €124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase
mainly related to the combined effects of: (i) €132.5 million of EBITDA, partially offset by (ii) a €8.9 million of
increase in inventory, trade payables and trade receivables, as well as other liabilities, and (iii) €20.4 million of
taxes paid.

Cash flow from operating activities, before the changes in net working capital, was €132.5 million for

the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of €83.9 million compared to €216.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (which also comprised €13.2 million of non-cash impairment losses and risk provisions).
Such change was substantially in line with the decrease in EBITDA (which decreased by €69.5 million from
€202.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023).

The cash inflow in net working capital was €18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,

compared to a cash outflow of €81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The trend was mainly
attributable to (i) a decrease in trade payables and receivables compared to the previous year due to a combined
effect of lower volumes and prices and (ii) a decrease in inventories due to a reduction in input costs.

120


-----

In addition, the year-to-year movement of cash flow from operating activities was affected by higher

taxes paid of €10.0 million. This increase was mainly due to the advances paid in 2023 as a result of the higher
tax base on which they are calculated (2022).

_2022 vs 2021_

Cash flow generated by operating activities was €124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,

an increase of €66.2 million compared to €57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Cash flow from operating activities, before the changes in net working capital, was €216.4 million for

the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of €178.8 million compared to €37.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Such increase was substantially in line with the increase in EBITDA (which increased by
€167.9 million from €34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €202.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022).

The cash outflow in net working capital was €81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,

compared to a cash inflow of €32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The trend was mainly
attributable to (i) a decrease in trade payables due to a significant level of payables in 2021 driven by the
inflationary trends of input costs combined with a decline in demand experienced in the second half of 2022,
partially offset by the change in trade receivables, which remained substantially stable in 2022 compared to the
previous year, due to the time mismatch between the increase in selling prices and their effect on sales that
followed in 2023 and (ii) an increase in inventories due to a mix of price increase and volumes.

In addition, the year-to-year movement of cash flow from operating activities was also affected by higher

taxes paid of €10.4 million due to the increase in taxable income of the group companies.

**_Cash flow from/(used in) investing activities_**

Cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to €212.5 million.

Cash flow used in investing activities mainly included increases in tangible assets of €62.2 million and intangible
assets of €23.0 million and the cash outflow for Fiskeby Acquisition of €127.5 million.

Cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to €66.4 million.

Cash flow used in investing activities mainly related to the following investments: the revamping of Ovaro
thermal plant, the “bridge A” refurbishment of the Arnsberg plant, the installation of a new boiler at the Eska
plant, as well as the implementation of the new ERP system for the Group.

Cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to €202.0 million

and mainly related to the combined effects of: (i) €155.7 million of investments in business combinations
primarily related to Eska Acquisition and the Paprinsa Acquisition, and (ii) €51.5 million for investments in
tangible and intangible assets (net of disposals) mainly relating to CO2 emission rights for an amount equal to
€28.5 million and additions to plant and machinery of €7.3 million, partially offset by (i) €5.0 million of cash
proceeds from the La Rochette Disposal and (ii) €0.2 million of dividends received.

See the section entitled “Capital expenditures” below for additional information relating to investments

in tangible and intangible assets.

**_Cash flow from/(used in) financing activities_**

Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to €68.2 million

and mainly related to (i) €123.2 million attributable to drawings under the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility, offset by
(ii) €47.4 million of interest paid, (iii) €4.7 million related to change in bank and other loans and (iv) €2.9 million
related to the change in other financial assets/liabilities.

121


-----

Cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to €33.7 million

and mainly related to (i) €432.6 million related to the proceeds received from the issuance of the Existing Notes
and repayment of long and short term borrowings from banks o €476.3 million and (ii) €43.3 million increase in
capital reserves.

Cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to €97.2 million

and mainly related to (i) €108.3 million of net cash generated from the change in other financial assets and
liabilities and short-term bank debts, partially offset by (ii) €5.3 million of dividends paid, (iii) €3.4 million of net
repayments of lease liabilities and (iv) €2.4 million of interests paid.

**Capital Expenditures**

We distinguish between (i) maintenance capital expenditures to maintain a certain level of productivity

and (ii) strategic capital expenditures to expand production capacity. While maintenance capital expenditures are
generally carried out throughout the year and require a limited amount of time to implement, our strategic capital
expenditures generally require our production sites to be closed over a longer period of time. Therefore, and in
order to maximize our theoretical production capacity, we have historically concentrated our strategic capital
expenditures during periods when production sites are closed for holidays, during Christmas holidays in
December and, for our Italian plants, in the month of August.

The following table sets forth a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023,

2022 and 2021, split between recurring capital expenditure and non-recurring capital expenditures.

We are exposed to certain risks associated with the general macroeconomic environment, including

exchange rate risk, commodity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The Group’s functional currency is the Euro. The exposure to exchange rate risk relates to sales,

purchases, receivables, current accounts, borrowings and loans expressed in currencies other than the functional
currency, mainly in USD, GBP and SEK. With reference to all currencies except SEK, in terms of exposure to
currency risk in 2023 the Group managed the marginal imbalance between investments and funds in the same
currency by using a natural-hedging approach and by carefully and continuously monitoring market conditions.
As a result, it was not deemed necessary to resort to hedging derivatives. The Fiskeby Group uses SEK as its
functional currency and uses forward exchange rates contracts to hedge currency risk related to their sales in Euro
and USD. As of December 31, 2023, following the completion of the Fiskeby Acquisition, these derivative
instruments have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group; since no formal designation
for hedge accounting purposes was made, these derivatives are recognized at fair value through profit and loss
according to IFRS 9.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the Group’s profit and loss to the fluctuations in exchange rates

versus the functional currency:

**_Commodity risk_**

The commodity risk mainly refers to the fluctuations of raw materials prices that are purchased for the

production and energy costs, which impact the margins that we can achieve on the products that we sell. The
nature of the Group’s business involves exposure to fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas and certain
chemical products derived from petroleum (such as latexes) and fibrous raw materials. Most contractual
relationships with customers involve a transfer of the price risk of the raw materials to the customer. In order to
mitigate the price risk where the transfer is not foreseen, the price lists with customers are reviewed on a quarterly
basis. Natural gas supply contracts are usually agreed for total requirements at a fixed price and are negotiated at
least three months before the supply period, and sometimes for longer periods in relation to the supply period.
Electricity is purchased partly at a fixed price, and partially indexed according to the values of continental
electricity markets as published by the bodies responsible for these markets. In order to contain possible price
pressure on raw materials, the Group aims to diversify its suppliers and its supply markets. As of the date of the
statement of financial position there are no derivative instruments held to commodity risk.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk mainly refers to the Group’s exposure to changes in cash flows due to fluctuation in

market interest rates, with particular reference to the interest expense outflows paid on financial debt. As of
December 31, 2023, more than 70% of the Group’s financial debt was represented by the Existing Notes bearing
an interest cost at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus 5.25% per annum, reset quarterly.
More than 20% of the Group’s financial debt was represented by the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility, bearing an
interest cost at a rate equal to six-month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus 3.00% per annum. The Group is also
party to a SEK-denominated credit line granted by Nordea Bank in Sweden, which amounted to €19.3 million as
of December 31, 2023.

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the debt instruments that bear a variable interest

rate and are therefore subject to volatility in market rates, which could impact the Group’s income and cash flow
statements. As of December 31, 2023, the Group was mainly exposed to interest rate risks through the Existing
Notes and the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility. See “Capitalization.” To hedge its exposure to the Existing Notes, in
2023, the Group entered into a zero-cost interest rate collar derivative financial instruments with BNP Paribas for
a notional amount of €220 million (the “Collar”). The Collar has a cap rate of 3.972%, a floor rate of 2.68%. The
Group did not hedge the financial liability associated with the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility. In connection with
the Transactions, the Group will repay in full and cancel the Existing Notes and the Fiskeby Acquisition Facility.
See “Use of Proceeds.”

An increase or reduction of 25 basis points in Euribor rates would result in a related increase or decrease

of finance expense of €871 thousand in 2024 and €1.9 million over the residual maturity of the Existing Notes.

Please refer to Note 23 to the Topco Audited Consolidated Financial Statements relating to “Current and

Non-Current payables to banks and other lenders” for a detailed description of our long-term financial debt.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is essentially derived from receivables from customers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk

is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers
broader factors that may impact the overall customer base, such as industry and country-specific default risks. To
mitigate the credit risk related to commercial counterparties, and therefore domestic and foreign customers, the
Group’s operating companies have put in place procedures aimed at ensuring that product are sold to customers
who are deemed reliable according to the Group’s standard payment and delivery conditions. This risk, which
takes the form of the possibility that the counterparty does not fulfill its contractual obligations is mitigated
through constant monitoring of each Group company’s commercial exposure and the collection times of
receivables. The amount of financial assets considered of doubtful recoverability is not significant; in any case it
is covered by appropriate allocations to the provision for doubtful receivables. For a complete description of the

125


-----

Group’s trade receivables gross and net of the provision for bad and doubtful receivables, please refer to Note 3
to the Topco Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that arises in relation to the Group’s ability to meet obligations under our

financial liabilities. Prudent management of liquidity risk stemming from the Group’s ordinary operating
activities entails maintaining sufficient levels of cash holdings, short-term securities and funding through
adequate credit lines. The Group strives to maintain an adequate stand-by credit lines in order to finalize contracts
and collect invoices, to an extent that ensures financial flexibility, including the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, which was fully undrawn as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Net Financial Debt
of the Group was equal to €545.5 million, with wide margins to satisfy all reasonable financial requirements.

**Use of Accounting Estimates**

The preparation of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes in accordance

with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The estimates and
assumptions used are based on experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Estimates are used to measure any provisions for doubtful receivables, inventory
obsolescence, depreciation and amortization, write-downs, employee benefits, restructuring funds, taxes, other
provisions, funds, and valuations of derivative instruments. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically,
and the effects of any changes are recognized in the income statement in the period in which the estimate is
revised (if the revision affects only that period) or in the period of the revision and future periods (if the revision
affects both current and future periods). In this respect, the situation caused by the present economic and financial
crisis has led to the need to make assumptions regarding future performance which are characterized by significant
uncertainty; as a consequence, therefore, actual future results may differ from the estimates. Although not
foreseeable at present, this could have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of the items in question.

The valuation methods and the main assumptions used by management in applying accounting standards

which relate to the future development of operations are described below. These methods and assumptions may
have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, meaning that
adjustments may need to be made in future years, with similarly significant effects on these amounts.

The following is a brief description of the accounting policies that entail the greatest extent of

management subjectivity in calculating estimates, and for which a change in the underlying conditions and
assumptions could have a significant impact on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more
detailed description of our significant accounting policies, please refer to the Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade and other receivables are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be received.

Subsequent adjustments are made to account for any write-downs. Non-current trade and other receivables are
subsequently measured at amortized cost.

_Derivatives_

According to IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments consist of assets and liabilities measured at fair

value and eligible for hedge accounting treatment only if the following requirements apply:

    - the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception;

    - the hedge is expected to be highly effective;

126


-----

    - effectiveness can be reliably measured;

    - the hedge is highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it is designated.

When derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatment applies:

    - for a fair-value hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure
to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities yielding or bearing a fixed rate), the derivative
instrument is measured at fair value and any gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. At
the same time, the carrying amount of the hedged assets or liabilities is adjusted to reflect the
changes in fair value with respect to the hedged risk;

    - for a cash flow hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure
to variability in the cash flows of assets or liabilities due to variations in exchange rates), the changes
in fair value of the instrument are initially recognized in a dedicated equity reserve in “Other
components of comprehensive income” and are subsequently reclassified to the income statement
in line with the effects of the hedged transaction on profit or loss.

If hedge accounting cannot be applied, the gains or losses from the fair value measurement of derivative

financial instruments are recognized immediately in the income statement.

_Taxes_

Current income taxes are based on an estimate of the taxable income for the year and based on the

applicable regulatory framework in the countries where the Group operates. The expected liability is recognized
under “Current taxes” net of any payments carried out in advance or withholding tax incurred.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amount of an

asset or liability and its tax base. “Deferred tax liabilities” consist of deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary
differences which will be taxed in future years in accordance with prevailing tax legislation. “Deferred tax assets”
consist of taxes which, despite being recoverable in future years, refer to the current year and are recognized
where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to absorb their recovery. Deferred tax liabilities
were offset by deferred tax assets where conditions specified in IAS 12 were met, notably where the two items
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and where there is a legally enforceable right to offset in
this manner.

Income taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly credited or

charged to shareholders’ equity. in which case the tax effect is recognized directly in that item. Deferred tax assets
are recognized for the carryforward of unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable income will be
available against which the unused tax losses can be used. Reno De Medici S.p.A. and some of its Italian
subsidiaries (R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l.) participated in the national tax consolidation
scheme pursuant to Article 117 et seq. of the Consolidated Income Tax Act (TUIR). Reno De Medici S.p.A. acts
as the consolidating company and becomes a single taxable base for the group of adhering companies, thereby
enabling this group to offset taxable income against tax losses in a single tax return. Each company participating
in the national tax consolidation agreement transfers its taxable income or tax loss to the consolidating company.

The subsidiary RDM Blendecques S.A.S is also part of the national tax consolidation agreement that

includes the subsidiary R.D.M. Marketing France S.A.S. on the basis of French “Article 223a of the General Tax
Code.”

_Impairment test_

According to IAS 36, at each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and

intangible assets with a finite useful life to assess whether these assets may have lost value (impairment

127


-----

indicators). If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is described as impaired. Where it
is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is

estimated by taking into account the provisions contained in accounting standard IFRS 13 Fair Value
Measurement. In estimating the value in use, expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a
post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset.

If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is less than its carrying amount,

the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognized in the
income statement. Except for goodwill, when there is no longer any reason for an impairment loss to be
recognized, the carrying amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to a new carrying amount based
on its estimated recoverable value, which may not exceed the net carrying amount that would have been
determined if no impairment loss had been recognized. The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in the
income statement.

Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment on an annual basis,

or more frequently if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.

**INDUSTRY**

**Introduction**

We manufacture white-lined chipboard WLC, a type of coated board used mainly for the production of

folding cartonboard packaging. We are also active in the production of SB for packaging and other applications, such
as luxury packaging, toys, books and stationary products. Both WLC and SB are manufactured from recovered paper
(“RCP”). According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data provided by a global management consulting company,
we are the largest non-integrated European manufacturer of white lined chipboard by production capacity (with a
capacity of 1,350 thousand tons per annum, pro forma for Fiskeby Acquisition and including Blendecques), the largest
producer of coated recycled cartonboard in Italy and in the Iberian Peninsula by production capacity, and the leader
by production capacity in Europe among non-integrated producers in the SB market (with a capacity of 360,000 tons).

**Folding Cartonboard Market**

**_Introduction_**

According to production capacity figures provided by a global management consulting company, folding

cartonboard manufacturing capacity expected for 2023 was approximately 8.7 million tons per annum in Europe as of
July 31, 2023. This total capacity is split between different paper grades including (i) WLC, which represents 48% of
the total capacity, (ii) FBB, which represents 46% of the total capacity, and (iii) solid bleached sulphate (“SBS”),
which represents 6% of the total capacity. WLC grades are manufactured from recycled papers and are referred to as
recycled grades whereas FBB and SBS grades are manufactured from virgin fibers and are referred to as virgin grades.

Cartonboard is used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications across both food and non-food

end-markets. Although cartonboard is widely used across industries, each of the types of paper grades has unique
properties that make it particularly suitable for certain specific uses.

    - WLC is used in a wide range of applications which includes cereals, dry foods, frozen and chilled foods,
detergent and pharmaceutically supported beauty products, confectionery outers, toiletries, household
goods, electrical, engineering products, car spares, do-it-yourself products, gardening, toys and games.
In addition, WLC is available to provide fat resistance and other barrier properties when specially treated,
which can make it suitable for use in fast food, pet food and soap packaging.

    - FBB is used in applications such as cosmetics, chocolate and sugar confectionery, medical and
healthcare, toiletries, dry foods, frozen and chilled foods, coffee and tea, biscuits and baked goods,
clothing, toys, games and photographic products.

    - SBS has excellent printing, structural design and embossing characteristics and is accordingly used in
luxury products and for products where hygiene and preservation of a product’s aroma or flavor is
critical, such as packaging for perfumes, cosmetics, chocolates, pharmaceuticals, frozen foods and
cigarettes.

**_End Markets_**

The graph below presents the pre-pandemic total demand (including both virgin and recycled grades) for

folding cartonboard in Europe by end use for 2019, before the impact on manufacturing caused by disruptions like
supply chain issues, the war in Ukraine, energy price increases, inflation, and potential recession. See “ WLC Industry
_Fundamentals—Historical Volume Growth Trends.”_

Source: Company information.

As shown in the graph above, the food end market generated 37% of total folding carton demand in 2019,

which corresponds to 2.7 million tons of folding carton board demand in 2019. Frozen and chilled food represents the
largest segment within the food end-market, with consumption totaling above 1 million tons per annum.

Within the folding cartonboard industry, WLC is mainly used for food, accounting for 55% of European

demand for WLC. The following chart presents the total demand for WLC by segment for 2019.

Source: Company information.

As represented in the above chart, the frozen & chilled food (19%) and dry food (16%) segments were the

segments with the greatest demand for WLC in 2019. Within these segments, WLC is used in a variety of applications
including pasta boxes, crackers, ready meals and prepared food. Packaging liners comprise 14% of WLC demand and
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics comprise 11% of WLC demand.

**_WLC Products Overview_**

WLC is comprised of multiple layers to enhance its rigidity, aesthetic qualities and other attributes. WLC’s

middle layers consist of recycled pulp made from mixed recovered papers or used cartonboard and containerboard
between a top layer and a back layer. The top layer is typically either pulp made from selected white-grade recovered

130


-----

paper or bleached chemical pulp. Selected recovered paper can also be used for the back layer. The overall recycled
content of WLC pulp typically varies from approximately 80% to 100%, as virgin pulp may be added to enhance
structural integrity. The top surface of WLC will typically have two or three layers of white pigment coating to allow
for brighter images and coloring when the cartonboard is printed on by customers, and the back layer may have a
coating of white pigment or may be left unpigmented, resulting in a grey or brown hue depending on its exact
recycled-fiber composition.

WLC is produced on board machines in several stages. Firstly, a dilute suspension of cellulose fiber (pulp)

in water is formed into a thin layer of entangled fibers on a moving plastic mesh, known as the wire. Some of the
water drains away and additional layers of pulp are added to achieve the desired grammage, thickness and composition
of the cartonboard. The remaining water is extracted by pressing and drying the board; this process results in inter-fiber
bonding that gives the recycled cartonboard its strength and rigidity. The board may then be coated if applicable to
enhance the whiteness, smoothness and surface finish for printing, varnishing and general appearance. Finally, there
are a number of finishing operations that take place such as slitting, reeling, sheeting, labelling, palletizing and
wrapping with moisture resistant material for storage and distribution.

**_WLC Industry Fundamentals_**

_Macro drivers and industry trends_

The push for sustainability from the market is greater than it has ever been before. Accordingly, the packaging

industry is evolving and increasingly substituting single-use plastic products with recyclable fiber-based alternatives.

Industry sources suggest that the current macroeconomic outlook is constructive for the WLC market and

support a strong link between demand for packaging, overall economic health and increasing gross domestic product,
as growth of disposable income and consumer spending as well as industrial production result in increased
consumption of packaging products.

The overall landscape for the packaging industry has been impacted by general demographic and lifestyles

trends, including growing preference for sustainable packaging among consumers, increasing demand for take-away
and home deliveries, and the growth in e-commerce. These trends support demand for cartonboard packaging, which
we believe will also increasingly benefit from trends favoring lighter-weight and reduced packaging, reflecting the
general focus on reducing packaging financial costs and negative environmental impacts.

For example, Coca-Cola has started replacing plastic film wrap with cartonboard multipack packaging and

Garnier has relaunched its “Ultra Doux” line of shampoos in a solid bar format encased in recyclable cardboard
packaging.

Despite the impact of these factors, we believe plastics and reusable transit packs will continue to compete

with cartonboard packaging, especially in more established markets and for applications that involve direct contact
with food. The future competitiveness of recycled fiber-based packaging will depend on innovation, product
development, cost and the industry’s ability in general to respond to changing market requirements.

_Legislation_

Directives regarding the packaging industry are an important factor driving plastic substitution trends and

providing attractive market opportunities for new solutions.

Over the past years, the European Union has conducted a review of key fiber-based industry regulations. For

instance, the single-use plastics directive (“SUPD”), which bans or enforces restrictions on several single-use plastic
items, has been reviewed and its scope has been broadened, such that biodegradable and bio-based plastics are
considered to be plastic under the directive. The directive set a collection target of 90% recycling for SUPD bottles
by 2029 (with an interim target of 77% by 2025). Another important directive is the PPWD, that the European
Commission originally proposed to revise in November 2022. On March 4, 2024 the European Council and the
Parliament reached agreed upon terms, which are pending formal adoption by both institutions. The revision aims at
restricting the use of single use plastic, such as plastic packaging for food and beverages and cosmetics and toiletry

131


-----

products. The amendments excluded re-use targets and re-fill obligations, which were included in initial drafting and
which could have had an adverse effect on fiber based products.

_Emerging Trends_

Industry data suggests that there are notable differences in the way the end market segments served by the

packaging industry are evolving:

    - _Food segment: demographic changes and consumer trends, particularly the growing preference for_
convenience, are driving innovation in packaging within this segment, although overall demand remains
steady. The potential to replace plastic packaging represents a significant opportunity for us, which has
been driven, in part, by restrictions on the use of plastic, retailers’ sustainability targets and increasingly
favorable consumer sentiment towards sustainability.

    - _Pharma & Beauty segment: packaging demand is expected to grow steadily within this segment, with_
evolution driven by increased personal spending and an ageing population.

    - _Food Service segment: growth driven by increasing spending on take-away and delivery food, influenced_
also from COVID-19 imposed closures and contingency measures to limit social interaction.

    - _Retail segment: e-commerce expansion increased retail packaging demand, despite demand generally_
mirroring the macroeconomic backdrop.

    - _Graphical & Cigarette segment: increased awareness of the dangers of smoking is leading to a decline_
in the number of smokers worldwide, resulting in a shrinking market for this segment.

_Customer Base_

In Europe, the customer base for folding carton board is fragmented, with more than 500 converters and the

largest five representing only around 30% of the regional capacity. Converters are located throughout Europe in order
to be closer to brand owners — large global consumer goods or food companies — who buy finished or semi-finished
packaging for their consumer goods and food products. Converters supply the final packaging products to the brand
owners, who typically work with few to several suppliers and have strong power in the value chain. RDM also sells
directly to brand owners in some instances, and we see partnerships with brand owners as an attractive avenue to
accelerate plastic substitution trends. Key purchasing criteria for converters and ultimately brand owners depend on
the end-use and on quality requirements. Typically, stiffness, smoothness and strength are the key quality properties
for cartonboard. Brightness can also be a key quality parameter when printability is important. Sustainability is also
playing an increasingly important role within key purchasing criteria. Local brands and smaller converters usually
make their purchasing decisions based on availability, cost and suitability for their machinery, whereas higher-end
brands tend to focus on quality over costs.

_Historical Volume Growth Trends_

According to a global management consulting company, the European folding cartonboard market has shown

a stable average growth in demand volume of 1.3% per annum from 2002 to 2021, especially in the FBB and WLC
segments. The chart below presents demand in Europe for WLC, FBB and SBS as well as total demand in Europe for
cartonboard for 2002 through 2023.

132


-----

Source: Company information.

The demand volume for the WLC segment has been growing at 0.4% per annum up to 2021 driven by stable

end-use market growth.

According to global management consulting company, the end-use segments that have mainly driven by the

growth of WLC demand have been food, pharmaceuticals and beverages. These segments have grown at 1.4%, 3.2%
and 1.2% per annum between 2015 and 2020, respectively.

According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data service provided by a global management consulting

company, European WLC demand volume is expected to grow by 900,000 tons between 2023 and 2028, mainly due
to two drivers:

    - _End-use development: positive market development across end uses led by Food end-use demand,_
especially from growth in frozen and chilled food.

    - _Sustainability trends: WLC is expected to gain popularity across end uses, benefiting from consumer_
sentiment, plastic bans and extended packaging responsibility (“EPR”) fees.

_Pricing Dynamics_

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the cartonboard and paperboard packaging industry, including WLC

experienced from a series of unprecedented but temporary phenomena which impacted the entire value chain.

The second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 were characterized by severe supply chain disruptions

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which contributed to an unprecedented increase in the cost of raw materials and
energy, which were then passed on to customers on the back of a strong demand for packaged goods. These factors,
together with other macroeconomic concerns, including the heightened international tensions due to the conflict in
Ukraine, led certain of our customers to secure higher levels of inventory, to meet expected market demand and
address supply chain uncertainty.

The second half of 2022 and the first three quarters of 2023 have seen an inventory correction as supply chain

disruptions sparked by COVID-19 eased and the balance between packaged goods and services were restored to prepandemic levels. Customers started reviewing their inventory management policies and decreased the level of WLC
products held in stock, primarily in order to realign inventories to historical levels, reduce the cost of maintaining
higher-than-usual inventory levels, and as a result of a decrease in sales of their products in certain end-markets, which
was driven by several macroeconomic factors, including a persistent inflationary environment and material increases
in global interest rates which led to a general decrease of private consumption with end-customers showing
recessionary behaviors.

The decline in demand was coupled with a reduction in the recycled fibers cost starting from the third quarter

of 2022 and a normalization of energy costs starting from fourth quarter 2022. The lower demand and lower raw
material prices generated some pressure on selling prices across the industry.

Source: Company information, RISI.

All of these trends and inputs price movements impacted the evolution of WLC demand and prices. The

_WLC Historical Spread Development_

Notwithstanding the evolution and volatility of recycled fiber prices in recent years post-pandemic described

above, producers in the WLC industry have historically been able to pass through increases in input cost to customers
and thereby preserve their spread (defined as difference between selling and input prices), even in periods of rapid
and significant cost increases.

Moreover, the graph below shows that while sale prices, old corrugated containers prices and spread have

fluctuated across cycles — for example they experienced a strong rebound after the 2008 global financial crisis —
there has been a general strong long-term trend toward increasing spreads over time.

Source: Company information, Global management consulting company.

There are several reasons behind this long-term historical spread upward trend, both related to structural

features of the market and to the companies operating in the sector. These include:

135


-----

  - the market structure of the industry, where certain large players such as RDM, which has over 25% market
share, influence pricing of the products;

  - no material new capacity is expected in core markets;

  - the Chinese import ban on European waste;

  - WLC cost competitiveness relative to other grades; and

  - increasing recycling rates and EU directives on waste reduction and plastic packaging reduction.

**Solidboard Market**

**_Introduction_**

We are active in the production and supply of recycled SB with our mill located in Ovaro and through the

Eska Group. As a result, our overall SB production capacity amounts to approximately 359,000 tons per year, making
us the largest producer of SB in Europe among non-integrated producers (i.e., producers who do not also operate as
converters).

Industry sources expect the global SB market to reach around 8.4 million tons by 2027. This growth is

primarily driven by: (i) strong opportunities in luxury packaging, an end-market expected to grow at a CAGR of
approximately 1.7% to 2027, as a result of increasing disposable incomes worldwide and increasing requests for
innovative, attractive and high quality products; (ii) developments in bookbinding and stationery, driven by rising
literacy rates in emerging markets and rising incomes in Asia; and (iii) increasing popularity in puzzles and games
due to an increased desire to disconnect from the digital world and from the innovative development of this category.

**_SB Products Overview_**

SB is a technically complex paper board grade with unique features, which is obtained through an integrated

production process — made of six intermediate steps — in which three layers are laminated in line:

    - _Pulp Preparation: recycled paper is mixed with water and turned into pulp, with existing impurities_
extracted from the mix through multiple steps using several specific techniques.

    - _Forming: water from the pulp is drained out and the pulp is carried on metal wires forming a paper web._
At the end of this process, almost 70% of the water is extracted.

    - _Press: up to 20% of the water is then extracted via a press system of nips made of rolls pressing against_
each other.

    - _Drying: the dryer section further desiccates the web through a series of internally steam heated cylinders_
that evaporate the moisture to reach the final moisture content of the board.

    - _Laminating: two layers of paper are laminated to the board to provide the required capabilities and then_
they are rolled on a reel.

    - _Cutting: the laminated SB is cut into sheets of the required size, packed and shipped to a printer or_
converter.

In addition to the three laminated layers, in accordance with each customer’s request and the characteristics

of the specific end market, it is possible to also add white offset paper lamination, barrier lamination and/or backside
lamination. Customization is relevant in SB as the board’s quality is determined by the degree to which the customer’s
technical requirements are met.

In general, the overall thickness of the three layers can range from 1.0 to 4.0mm, with the central thicker

layer accounting for 50-60% and the two external layers equally to 20-25% each.

**_Solidboard Industry Fundamentals_**

SB is a frontrunner in the megatrend towards 100% sustainable packaging products and operations. Being

sustainable is a key purchasing criterion for customers’ choices, driving the demand for SB:

    - Europe is leading the sustainability megatrend, but North America and Asia are also increasing their
focus, creating new opportunities.

    - The increased awareness of the hazards of plastics among consumers is pressuring luxury brands to use
plastic-free and sustainable packaging. In the consumer and luxury business sector there are already
more than 400 major companies that have declared their commitment towards the reduction of plastics
usage.

In general, attention to and awareness of the benefits of recycling is increasing in media, politics and

corporations and within society at large. Developing countries are shifting their attention towards introducing and
improving their recycling and collection programs as opposition mounts against products with poor recycling rates
(e.g., single use plastics).

Sustainability is not the only fundamental that we believe supports the future success of the SB sector. In

particular, the global luxury market is bouncing back after suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic with an expected
annual growth pace between 3-5% until 2027. The grade is used in high-end packaging for several luxury products
including jewelry, fashion, wine and spirits, perfumes and cosmetics, as well as consumer electronics and fine foods.
These end markets also represent a major force in product innovation, as luxury brands constantly look to evolve and
develop their packaging.

**Recycled Paper Market**

**_Introduction_**

Paper can be produced using different types of fibers, either fresh virgin (wood) fibers or recycled paper. The

majority of recycled paper is collected from households and from the commercial and industrial industries, where
paper-based packaging accumulates. However, the amount of paper that can be recovered is largely dependent on
legislation that regulates who is allowed to collect and how paper is separated at the source. This has an impact on
production, as it is costly to sort mixed waste (paper) streams afterwards and comingling general waste and wastepaper
deteriorates fiber quality.

_Market trends_

The growing focus on sustainability is boosting demand for recovered paper. As a result, cartonboard and

SB, made from recycled paper collected from municipal, commercial and industrial paper sources, are becoming
increasingly popular alternatives in many industries.

In 2022, within the European paper industry, the usage of paper for recycling was at approximately 49 million

tons, with an additional net volume of approximately 5 million tons (10% of the total 55 million tons) bought by
non-European countries. As discussed, the formerly high Chinese demand for European PfR has decreased to levels
close to zero. In 2022, the main export destinations of European PfR are India, Indonesia, Turkey and Vietnam. Other
countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, have also increased imports of European PfR. As discussed, China is no
longer a main importer of European recycled paper. Within the EU, material differences exist among the major
European economies, with Germany, The Netherlands and Spain being net importers of both brown and white recycled
paper grades, while Italy and France are net exporters.

In 2023, demand softness was primarily driven by a customer de-stocking cycle after customers built up their

inventories during 2022 due to anticipated global supply chain disruptions after COVID-19. Other dynamics
influenced the paper industry such as substitution among grades and impact of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as
entering of new competitors in European market. As a result of the above trends, almost all paper producers in Europe
experienced reductions in revenues and volumes, which led to the implementation of price corrections.

Overall, in Europe, where paper collection is an advanced practice, collection rates for paper and boards are

already high (especially in industrial and retail). According to EUROSTAT, in between 2010 and 2021 the paper and
cartonboard recycling rate was close to 82.5%.

138

Source: Company information.

Regulations are a key factor affecting the use of recycled paper. Collection is regulated at the European,

national and municipal levels. The European “Green Deal” package signed in 2019 and the evaluation of the “EU
Waste Shipment Regulation” (Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007), implemented in 2019 represent an action plan to boost
a clean circular economy, restore biodiversity and decrease pollution, which requires increasing waste collection and
recycling. With this aim, different levels of restrictions for the import and export of waste are under consideration and
countries are taking actions to introduce bans on waste imports and tighter regulation concerning waste quality and
contamination.

More specifically, the “Waste Framework Directive” (Directive 2018/851), establishes the following priority

order for managing waste: (i) waste prevention, (ii) reuse, (iii) recycling and (iv) other forms of recovery and disposal,
setting specific targets for the EU member states. According to the directive, the re-use and recycling of municipal
waste shall be increased to a minimum of 55%, 60% and 65% by 2025, 2030 and 2035 respectively. Moreover, the
“Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive” (Directive 2018/852/EC) sets out measures and requirements for the
prevention, re-use and recovery of packaging waste within the Member States.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading European producer and distributor of recycled cartonboard, active in the coated and

uncoated recycled cartonboard industry. We operate in the WLC and solidboard SB market segments, in each case
with a demonstrated track record of making our operations more sustainable as both WLC and SB are manufactured
from recovered paper and we actively invest in our operations to reduce emissions, waste, water usage and other
environmental factors. Our cartonboard can be used as both primary and secondary packaging. Our WLC products
are predominantly used, without limitation, in packaging for the food, hygiene and cleaning, pharmaceuticals and
healthcare, electronics, textile and toy industries. Our SB products are mostly used for the packaging of luxury goods,
publishing applications (bookbinding), as well as for graphical applications, such as for puzzles and games.

Our identity is built on a clear vision centered on the circular economy that guides our activities as a

manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, and that represents a balanced combination between our
business and the expectations of our stakeholders; see also “—Our Production Process—Circular Business Model.”
Our ambition is to be the partner of choice of all key stakeholders with three strategic goals in mind: to offer excellent
products and services, to optimize costs and to maximize the satisfaction of our customers, all while helping drive
increased sustainability within the paper and packaging industry.

As of December 31, 2023, we served our customers through a network of ten mills (including Blendecques),

four sheeting and distribution centers, and 13 sales offices. As of December 31, 2023, we employed over 2,520
employees.

We believe that our geographical footprint across Europe and exposure to resilient end-markets (such as the

food end-market) are key strengths of our business, which we have reinforced through the recent Fiskeby Acquisition
in 2023 (in addition to Eska and Paprinsa Acquisitions in 2021). Our position as a leader in the European WLC market
is supported by our distributed network of mills, our “multi-mill” concept, whereby we seek to be able to offer similar
cartonboard products at different mills whenever possible, helping us meet our customers’ demands quickly regardless
of their proximity to a specific production site, and guarantee security of supply to our entire customer base. Our
distributed mill network is integrated by our “One Company” operating model, which helps to ensure we have both a
local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and sophistication required to efficiently respond to
our customers’ needs across the continent.

    - **_WLC. In our WLC market segment, we produce cartonboard from recycled fibers for folding carton and_**
corrugated packaging applications. According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data provided by a
global management consulting company, we are the largest non-integrated WLC producer (based on
annual production capacity as of December 31, 2023), with a market share of approximately 27% for the
year ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) by volumes
sold, in a rather consolidated European market. In terms of production capacity, WLC represents
approximately 79% of our business as of December 31, 2023 (giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby
Acquisition).

    - We had a total WLC production capacity of 1,350 thousand tons per year for the year ended
December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) of which 110 thousand
tons was attributable to our Blendecques mill, which we are planning to close by the second half of 2024
as discussed further under “Summary—Recent Developments—Closure of the Blendecques mill.”

    - **_SB. In our SB market segment, we produce SB from recycled fibers for packaging and graphical_**
applications. We had a total production capacity of 360 thousand tons per year for the year ended
December 31, 2023. In terms of production capacity, SB represents approximately 21% of our business
as of December 31, 2023. We are a leading SB producer with a global reach. Following the Eska
Acquisition, we now have three industry-leading SB production facilities (in terms of production
capacity) across The Netherlands and Italy, with the largest SB production capacity among participants
in the core market segments in which Eska operates (which include luxury packaging, bookbinding,
puzzles and games) for the year ended December 31, 2023.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition

as if it had occurred on January 1, 2023), we generated Adjusted Pro Forma Revenues from Sales of €844.6 million
and Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of €157.7 million (representing a margin of 18.7%) and we sold
approximately 1,018 thousand tons (excluding Blendecques). The charts below present the breakdown of our tons sold
by geography, by relevant end-market and by product, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2023. The
following graphs show tons sold splits of the Group (after giving pro forma affect to the Fiskeby Acquisition).

Source: Company information.

As of December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition), we served over 2,500

customers across our WLC and SB market segments and sold our products, either directly or indirectly, in over 100
countries worldwide.

We remain united by our “One Company” culture and philosophy and believe that the size of our network

and breadth of our geographical footprint give us significant competitive advantages, including greater operational
flexibility to serve our customers and manufacture our products across our network of mills, as well as enhanced
capacity to supply our products in a timely manner and the flexibility to produce our products at more than one mill.
While our network of nine paper mills is strategically located to best serve our pan-European customer base, which
requires localized service, our operations remain integrated. We centrally manage operations, and we are currently
enhancing our ability to integrate operations across our network by implementing the same ERP systems in all of our
mills. Additionally, improvements to our IT resources have allowed, and we believe we will continue to allow, us to
balance the availability of products across our network of mills, to optimize profitability and proximity to customers,
to protect their security of supply and to mitigate the risks posed by market volatility arising from changes in the
supply and demand dynamics in local markets. Over the last two years, we have pursued a broad array of technology
initiatives including the creation of sophisticated digital applications to deliver high-quality and innovative products
across the entire value chain as well as the roll-out of a comprehensive digital transformation program aimed at
achieving efficiencies through all areas of the Group, including projects on operations, logistics, procurement, human
resources, sales, planning and health and safety. Key IT products include the internal tools for corporate management
performance, managerial reporting, human capital management and portfolio project management. We will continue
to implement technological development initiatives to pursue our lean manufacturing philosophy, including through
new analytic initiatives to enhance quality integration, procurement, pricing and supply chain savings.

**_Our products and customers_**

We manufacture different types of recycled paperboard, sold as sheets or rolls, mainly to packaging

manufacturers. The majority of our sales derive from resilient and essential end-markets, such as the food end-market.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition),

more than 59% of the end-users of our WLC products operated within the resilient food market. Our SB products are

-----

purchased for use in applications such as producing packaging for the growing luxury packaging market, as well as
bookbinding, stationary, and manufacturing puzzles and games.

We are committed to sustainability and believe that are well-placed to benefit from the ongoing shift away

from plastic packaging and toward more sustainable alternatives. We believe that we have an attractive sustainability
profile, and our commitment to sustainability has been historically supported by a track record of demonstrable
achievements. For the year ended December 31, 2023 (after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition),
approximately 95% of the fibrous material we used was recycled and over 84% of all materials used consisted of
renewable materials. In addition, we have reduced our water discharges per ton of cartonboard produced by
approximately 15% since 2021.

As our business continues to evolve, we remain committed to strengthening our product portfolio and

offerings by focusing on renewable, recyclable and actually-recycled solutions (solutions with high recycling rates).
In line with the latest market trends, we are directing our development activities toward cartonboard and SB products
that can replace plastic packaging and are safe to be used for food product. We are focusing our efforts toward the
development of renewable and recyclable “barrier solutions” that are fully integrated with the fiber-based material
structure of the cartonboard. Our consistent aim is to promote and preserve the integrity of the packaged product while
ensuring recyclability of the coated and uncoated cartonboard after its use. In particular, the key themes of our product
innovation are (i) plastic to paper, with a focus on safety for food applications and barriers for grease, water and
oxygen; (ii) digitalization experience by delivering WLC and SB designed for e-commerce; (iii) environmental
experience with a continued focus on alternative sources for fibers and (iv) premium experience by delivering
premium materials and bi-colors board.

We are also currently developing a portfolio of new sustainable solutions to be rolled-out between 2025 and

2028, which we expect will increase our production volumes by more than 300 thousand tons per year. We are
committed to increase transparency in sustainability. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the external validation of
the carbon footprint of our products and undergoing a third-party life cycle assessment. These activities will allow us
to evaluate sustainability claims and prioritize product initiatives with higher sustainability score.

**Key Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths.

**_We are the leader in the attractive WLC market, well supported by the long-term plastic substitution_**

**_macrotrend._**

With a total WLC production capacity of 1,350 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2023

(after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition and including Blendecques), we have the largest production
capacity of WLC across Europe and the largest market share (27%) by volumes sold. Our position as a leader in the
European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills integrated by our “One Company” operating
model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and
sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent.

(3) Including a portion of the Ovaro mill capacity, which also manufactures SB products.

(4) Includes Competitor B acquisition of Competitor D.

As a leading WLC manufacturer, we are in the position to benefit from the growth and evolution of the WLC

market. Industry sources indicate that the WLC market segment is resilient and diversified. Just as the demand for
WLC ultimately depends on the demand from the end markets, the resilience of the WLC industry is also supported
by the diversity and by the resilience of the industry’s end markets.

The chart below is based on analysis from a global management consulting company and highlights how the

WLC demand is driven by the stable and resilient food end-market. Food end-market demand is defined by different
sub-segments, such as frozen and chilled food (19% of total demand), driven by demographic changes and
convenience trends, dry food (16% of total demand) and other food sub-segments (12% of total demand). Overall the
broad food end-market represents approximately 38% of the total demand for WLC.

We believe a number of market trends will continue to support WLC market development in Europe over the

next several years – with Southern Europe expected to experience even stronger demand growth as a consequence of
WLC’s stronger position in the region – and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

In particular, we believe there is a positive outlook for WLC over the next five years, as plastics replacement

trials start to move through to larger scale rollout. According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data provided by a
global management consulting company, there will be an additional market demand for 900 thousand tons of WLC
products between 2023 and 2028 (of which 160 thousand tons are expected by the end of 2024) due to plastic

replacement opportunities. Primarily, these opportunities are present in the food and homecare sectors due to
cartonboard’s strength and barrier properties, which make it a suitable substitution for fruit punnets, confectionery
secondary packaging and dishwasher tablets or dilutables. To a lesser extent, there are additional opportunities in the
beverage, cosmetics and pharma sectors as the cartonboard’s structural integrity, premium finish together with its
other properties make it a good fit to drink multipacks, secondary packaging for cosmetic tubs and tubes or primary
packaging for multivitamins. We also believe that the growing preference for sustainable products, along with
increasing regulatory actions against the use of plastics and plastic packaging, will likely lead a growing number of
manufacturers to switch from plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, such as the WLC packaging made
from recycled fibers that we produce.

Additionally, we expect that e-commerce growth will drive demand for WLC liners used in packaging

production. We expect that demographic shifts and changes in consumer preferences favoring convenience will
increase the demand for frozen and convenience foods, and these segments of the food end-market are especially
heavy users of WLC packaging.

The charts below illustrate (based on analysis from a global management consulting company) the estimated

growth in WLC usage in Southern Europe for the periods indicated, as well as the estimated growth (2019 – 2030) for
the various WLC end segments. These changes are driven by, among others, a preference for fiber-based materials
and sustainable products, increased popularity of frozen and chilled foods driven by geographic changes and
convenience trends, and increased focus on replacement of plastic packaging by sustainable options in light of brand
owners’ and retailers’ sustainability targets in response to increasing consumer sentiment favoring sustainability.

While these trends benefit the WLC market as whole, we believe our commitment to sustainability, leadership

in the circular economy with recycled WLC production, and established presence in serving the food end-market
uniquely position us to capture the potential growth in WLC demand driven by these factors. We believe that there is
material industry growth upside associated with increased plastic substitution, as illustrated in the chart above.

**_We also have a presence in the resilient and growing SB industry and are well-positioned to benefit from_**

**_further growth._**

As shown in the following graph, our SB production capacity ranks among the largest SB producers in

Europe.

(2) Integrated to converting; still including the recently announced closure of a 75Kton mill in the Netherlands.

The SB market segment is a stable and resilient market given the defensive characteristics of the main end
use markets, such as bookbinding and stationery. The graph below illustrates the estimated growth, according to
management estimates, of the global SB market for the periods indicated in thousands of tons.

Source: Company information

Industry sources expect that the global SB market will reach around 8.4 million tons by 2027. This growth is

primarily driven by: (i) strong opportunities in luxury packaging, an end-market expected to grow at a CAGR of
approximately 1.7% to 2027, as a result of increasing disposable incomes worldwide and increasing requests for
innovative, aesthetically pleasing and high quality products; (ii) developments in bookbinding and stationery, driven
by rising literacy rates in emerging markets and rising incomes in Asia; and (iii) increasing popularity in puzzles and
games due to an increased desire to disconnect from the digital world and from the innovative development of puzzles
and games. We believe that the US market also represents an important growth opportunity, including for our WLC

market segment, and we are relocating our sheeting and distribution center in Virginia from Chesapeake to a larger
site in Suffolk, to leverage our growth in such market.

The graph below illustrates the SB market segmented by end-use for the year ended 2019 (expressed in

percentages and excluding SB packaging).

Source: Company information

The trend towards sustainable and recyclable products further favors the use of SB, a material that is fully

recyclable, instead of plastics, and we expect to have the opportunity to drive plastic substitution via the SB market
as well, helping to further increase packaging sustainability while simultaneously increasing our company’s financial
performance and growth.

Through the acquisition of Eska, which complemented our previous acquisition of the Ovaro mill and

significantly increased our production capacity of SB products, which evolved from a minor part of our portfolio to
representing a key component of our product offering, we believe we have further expanded our products and offerings
in the SB market segment and we are well positioned to continue to expand.

**_We have a diversified product portfolio focused on essential and resilient end-markets with a well-_**

**_diversified and not concentrated customer base._**

Our business benefits from a diverse customer base and low customer concentration. For the year ended

December 31, 2023, we had a customer base of over 2,500 customers (giving _pro forma_ effect to the Fiskeby
Acquisition and including our Blendecques mill), with no single client representing more than 4% of our sales
volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest customers accounted for 22% of our total sales by
volume, and our top 100 customers accounted for approximately 64% of our total sales by volume (in each case
calculated giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition and including our Blendecques mill).

Although our customers serve participants in a number of end-markets, almost half of our products are

ultimately used in the uniquely attractive and resilient food end-market. In 2023, this end-market accounted for 49%
of our total sales by volume. The chart below indicates, for the period ended December 31, 2023, our exposure to
various end-use markets (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby and including Blendecques). The chart below
indicates our exposure to end-markets as of December 31, 2023.

(3) Includes pharma & healthcare, detergents & cleanings, beauty & cosmetics, household kitchen and gardening, IT electronics media and
technical.

(4) Includes stationery, display & showcards, bookbinding.

In addition, we expect the use of WLC packaging to increase in the food end-market as well as in the

pharmaceutical and cosmetics end-markets in response to consumer preferences for sustainability and increased
regulation for the reduction of plastic packaging use. We also believe that the higher demand for frozen and
convenience foods will further support food as being an attractive end-market for our business.

**_Pan-European, strategic asset base close to customers providing significant competitive advantages._**

We operate in accordance with our “multi-mill” and “multi-country” approaches, which we believe provide

us with significant competitive advantages in our sector, particularly given the highly localized nature of our customers
and the industry. Our multi mill concept represents one of our core operating principles. We aim to produce our
products in multiple mills whenever possible to ensure that our products are available to our customers in a flexible
and punctual manner and in close proximity to their production sites. We believe that the multi mill concept allows us
to adapt efficiently to changes in market demand and the economic cycles of the countries in which we operate. We
believe we have a well invested asset base, in terms of capacity, technical age, speed and trim compared to our industry
peers, which enables us to effectively pursue our “multi-mill” concept. As of December 31, 2023, we served our
customers through a network of ten mills (including Blendecques), four sheeting and distribution centers, and 13 sales
offices. Our mills are located in Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, Germany, France and Sweden, giving us a pan European
and strategic asset base close to our customers. As further discussed under “Summary—Recent Developments—
_Closure of the Blendecques mill,” we are currently planning to cease operations at the mill located in Blendecques,_
France, by the second half of 2024. Rather than managing each single mill to produce a single product, our mills are
designed, and operate, to manufacture multiple products whenever possible. As a result, we can shift production of
many of our products across our network of mills, which gives us flexibility to balance the availability of products at
individual plants and to integrate production planning across our mills. We also believe that our multi-mill concept
reinforces the benefits that we derive from our multi-country asset base. By increasing the interchangeability of our
mills and the specific types of our cartonboard produced in multiple mills, we also increase our ability to meet our
customers’ needs at each local plant. This allows us to reduce the time and cost required for product delivery and to
be more immediately responsive to customers’ needs and changing demands, providing meaningful upside in a market
characterized by localized preferences and requirements. Our focus on coordination within our multi-mill network
also allows us to monitor and better respond to market volatility arising from rapid changes in local demand or changes
in production at individual mills as well as from potential supply chain disruptions.

As part of the integration of the Fiskeby business following the Fiskeby Acquisition, we have successfully

applied our multi-mill concept to the Swedish plant. We believe that the multi-mill concept and post-acquisition
integration will allow us to transfer production volumes to different locations to reduce delivery times for existing
customers as well as to find new and more profitable markets and volumes.

**_We have historically demonstrated the ability to navigate in volatile environment delivering strong_**

**_financial performance._**

Starting from 2021 and 2022, as part of an industry-wide unprecedented and temporary phenomenon

affecting our entire value chain, we have experienced significant stocking and de-stocking dynamics, which resulted
in a divergence of patterns between consumption by our customers, on the one hand, and supply dynamics in our
product end-markets, on the other hand.

In particular, in 2021 and the first half of 2022, we experienced increased stocking by many of our customers,

which was primarily driven by their need to secure higher levels of inventories to meet expected market demand and
address supply chain uncertainty caused by macroeconomic concerns, such as supply chain disruptions related to
COVID-19 and other factors and heightened international tensions due to the conflict in Ukraine. Conversely, starting
in the second half of 2022, we experienced a decrease in the sale of our products, primarily as a result of the reduction
in purchase volumes by some of our customers who implemented de-stocking policies. Such customers started
reviewing their inventory management policies and decreased the level of our products held in stock as they prepared
for a generally improved macroeconomic environment in 2023 and as a result of a decrease in sales of their products
in certain end-markets, which was driven by several macroeconomic factors, including a persisting inflationary
environment, a material increases in global interest rates and general softness of private consumption with endcustomers showing recessionary behaviors.

We believe the de-stocking trend has now ended, as the stock of WLC in the European market is currently

very low as illustrated by the below chart from the European association representing the paper industry, CEPI.

This is also supported by the strong uptick in order intakes that the WLC European market is currently

experiencing, as illustrated by the below chart (source: CEPI), which clearly indicates that the demand is picking up.

-----

The decline in demand was coupled with a reduction in input costs, including the price of wastepaper starting

from the third quarter of 2022 and a normalization of energy costs starting from fourth quarter 2022. While the lower
demand and lower raw material prices generated some pressure on selling prices and we have slightly revised our
selling prices downward, we have managed to do that at a slower pace compared to our competitors due to our capacity
management and volume placement.

Importantly, due to our leading market position and size, we have been very disciplined on pricing and able

to retain more of the increase in our selling prices that we achieved over 2021 and 2022 versus the reduction in input
costs seen over the last year, allowing us to stabilize our contribution margin around €320 per ton over 2023. As
illustrated by the below chart, our current level of profitability is much higher compared that what we have been able
to achieve historically. We expect this level of contribution margin per ton to be sustainable. Additionally, we did not
sacrifice material market share to achieve this result.

(5) Figures including the La Rochette Disposal the Paprinsa Acquisition, the Eska Acquisition and the Fiskeby Acquisition.

(6) Figures for the year 2023 including the Fiskeby Group.

While through Fiskeby we also enter into long-term agreements with some of our brand partners, we are

otherwise generally not bound by long-term sales contracts, but operate instead through budget agreements and
purchase orders, which gives us flexibility to respond to market conditions. See also “—Our Customers and
_Stakeholders.” Given the encouraging order intake in the beginning of 2024 and the persisting inflationary_
environment, we have recently announced a price increase of approximately €60 per ton (representing an increase of
approximately 8% compared to our prices in December 2023) on WLC products starting from March 2024. We believe
this will continue to have a positive impact on our profitability.

Our adaptive strategy has allowed our business to navigate through periods of macroeconomic instability and

despite volatility in the paper and packaging sector across since 2021. The following graph shows the Group’s success
in EBITDA growth since 2021.

At the time of RDM Acquisition, we conservatively identified approximately €20 million of annual gross

cost savings. Since then, we have revised the amount of initiatives we expect to be able to achieve upwards, reaching
a total €64 million at the end of year 2028. These initiatives include (but are not limited to):

      - **_Plant initiatives: investment in new equipment and machinery upgrades at the plant level to reduce_**

**_We play a central role in the sustainable paper circular economy and have developed a record of_**

**_successfully executing our sustainability initiatives. We aim to continue to be a leader in this field and achieve our_**
**_well-identified long-term sustainability goals._**

As a manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, we view ourselves as playing a key role in

maintaining a sustainable circular economy. The primary raw material used in our manufacturing process is PfR and
paperboard obtained from municipal paper collection and commercial or industrial sources. We believe we are the
keystone “link” in the circular economy: we dissolve, treat and form wastepaper into recycled cartonboard, giving it
new life and use. Our WLC products are mainly sold to customers in the converting industry, who manufacture
packaging using the WLC we provide, while our SB products are sold to customers in industries such as printing and
bookbinding as well as to converters for use in packaging. After passing through the end-user, these materials can be
recycled and resupplied to us as raw materials for use in the manufacturing of new WLC or SB.

All of our products are fully recyclable, enabling them to be converted to packaging at a later stage.

Furthermore, for the year ended December 30, 2023, approximately 95% of the fibrous materials we used came from
recycled materials and over 84% of all materials used consisted of renewable materials, enabling us to foster the
circular economy.

In addition in 2022, we implemented strategic initiatives for the management and improvement of the quality

of the water used in the production from the mills of Hoogezand, Santa Giustina and Barcelona, that allow us to recycle

152


-----

the process water. In 2023, we invested in the development of the Ovaro power plant. These successful initiatives
further improved our water efficiency and contributed to strong operational performance. We have also started
building a new CHP plant in Barcelona to further reduce our GHG Emissions and achieve cost savings, which we
expect will be completed in the end of the second quarter of 2024.

The graph below depicts our contribution to the circular economy. For further detail, see also “—Our

_Production Process—Circular Business Model.”_

Source: Company information

Guided by this clear, shared vision as well as by our core commitment to sustainability and the circular

economy, we have established long-term sustainability goals and developed a track record of making our operations
more sustainable.

Going forward, we intend to build on these successes to achieve our long-term sustainability goals with

respect to promoting water efficiency, reducing the effects of climate change, waste reduction and increased recovery,
employee safety and wellbeing, diversity and responsible sourcing of materials. See also “—Environmental, Social
_and Governance (ESG) matters.”_

**_We are led by an experienced and effective management team._**

We benefit from an experienced management team led by our Chief Executive Officer, Michele Bianchi,

who has over 25 years of experience within the industry, having served as Managing Director at both DS Smith and
SCA/DS Smith Packaging. In addition, we benefit from the deep experience of our Chief Financial Officer, Simone
Montanari, who has over 25 years of experience within finance departments (previously CFO at Comau, Moncler and
Piaggio Group), and Andrea Bettinelli, our Head of Strategy, who has over 14 years of experience at RDM, among
other businesses. Other individuals with an important impact on our operations are Pierre-Yves Corbiere (Chief Sales
Officer), Gianluca Scaglioni (Head of Operations) and Krzysztof Krajewski (Chief Sustainability and Innovation
Officer) with 19, 27 and 22 years, respectively, of relevant experience in the industry. For further information on our
management team and their qualifications, see also “Management.”

**_We are committed to improving our environmental impact with well identified sustainability goals._**

Our management team has demonstrated its ability to manage and to grow our business, to adapt to changing

market conditions, to undertake strategic investments and to integrate innovative technology to our production
processes. Our management team is committed to improving our positive environmental impact by focusing on GHG
emissions, waste sent for recovery and wastewater discharge associated with production, as outlined in our

**Business Strategy**

**_Further strengthen our positioning in the WLC market and expansion in the SB market._**

Through the Eska Acquisition and Paprinsa Acquisition, we have acquired three additional production sites,

expanded our SB product offerings, solidified our market leadership on the Iberian Peninsula, and broadened the
geographic footprint of our network of mills into The Netherlands and distribution centers into the United States.
Furthermore, with the Fiskeby acquisition we have grown our market share in the recycled board market, broadened
the geographic footprint of our network of mills into Sweden and became the largest independent recycled board
producer in Europe. The Fiskeby Acquisition provided us with the opportunity to further diversify and consolidate
our position in Northern and Central Europe, enhancing our multi-mill approach, strengthening our ESG profile, while
improving the overall quality of our offering and granting us direct access to brand owners providing volumes visibility
and opportunities to accelerate plastic substitution.

**_Actively integrate our recent acquisitions to extract commercial and cost synergies and operate with a_**

**_culture of continuous improvement to perpetually strengthen our operating efficiencies and streamline our cost_**
**_structure._**

We have identified several synergy opportunities that we are actively pursuing as the process of integrating

Fiskeby progresses. We have also identified various cost savings initiatives that we conservatively believe will provide
us with potential annual gross cost savings of over €36.6 million in aggregate by the end of 2028 (noting that we have
identified additional areas of upside for further cost savings). These initiatives include (but are not limited to):

    - **_Plant initiatives:_** plant-level operational efficiencies from machinery upgrades / new equipment to
decrease variable costs (e.g., waste, which we believe could yield gross cost savings of approximately
€12.8 million per year once fully implemented);

    - **_Energy opportunities: investment in new co-generation plant and other equipment to reduce energy costs_**
(which we believe could yield gross cost savings of approximately €14.7 million per year once fully
implemented);

    - **_“ExcellenceOne” Program: a program composed of several initiatives such as lean manufacturing_**
philosophy roll-out, process analytics, maintenance, quality integration, procurement / pricing and
supply chain saving through digitalization (which we believe could yield gross cost savings of
approximately €1.2 million per year once fully implemented); and

154


-----

    - **_Fiskeby Integration: alignment of the performance of the overall equipment effectiveness to the Group_**
one, together with price repositioning, cross selling potential and procurement synergies (which we
believe could yield additional EBITDA impact of €8.0 million).

**_Leverage Fiskeby attractive product offering to expand geographical reach and increase customer base_**

We believe that the Fiskeby acquisition has been highly strategic and will provide us with the opportunity to

(i) grow our market share in the recycled board market and become the largest independent non-integrated recycled
board producer in Europe, (ii) enhance the security of our supply, (iii) expand in attractive markets such as the United
Kingdom, Baltics, Nordics and Poland, (iv) serve pan-European customers in a multi-mill reinforced approach, (v)
improve our cost structure with Fiskeby’s waste-to-energy plant that shelters the mill from any volatility moves in the
energy markets, (vi) use the higher technical performance of Fiskeby’s boards to compete with producers of virgin
fiber cartonboards, and (ix) reduce our carbon footprint, as the Fiskeby’s mill uses alternative sources of energy.

**_Continue implementing our digitalization agenda to strengthen our “One Company” culture and_**

**_multi-mill concept._**

We believe our multi-mill concept and “One Company” culture provide us with tangible competitive

advantages, and we plan to scale up the impact of these key strengths by further implementing our digitalization
agenda. In addition, we believe our digitalization agenda will allow us to further develop and integrate our multi-mill
concept in our SB sector following the Eska Acquisition in order to continuously improve and enhance our product
offerings, competitive advantages and interchangeability with products produced in the various SB mills.

Our digitalization agenda is a comprehensive digital transformation program aimed at achieving efficiencies

through all areas of the Group, including projects on operations, logistics, procurement, human resources, sales,
planning and health and safety. As such, we strive to further expand and improve our product and service offerings,
as well as our manufacturing and service processes. We view digital improvement as a key strategy to improve our
efficiency, innovation and coordination across our operations.

Through sophisticated digital applications, we are focused on continuing to deliver high-quality and

innovative products across the entire value chain and circular economy in which we operate, with a clear strategy of
continuously strengthening our operational efficiency and excellence through lean manufacturing plans and initiatives.

**_Continue developing new, innovative products to answer the needs of our customers_**

We believe that product innovation is a key pillar of our strategy and we are focused on further improving

our product offering in order to answer the needs of our clients, be on top of secular trends and capitalize on new
opportunities and unlock additional growth. In this respect, we have identified certain strategic themes which are the
key focus areas of our product innovation:

    - _Plastic to paper substitution: working on greater usage of papers for food applications and barriers for_
grease, water and oxygen;

    - _Digitalization experience: working on WLC and SB designed for e-commerce;_

    - _Environmental: working on alternative sources for fibers; and_

    - _Premium: working on creation of bi-color boards and premium materials._

**_Maintain our sustainability leadership and our focus on achieving our long-term sustainability goals._**

Sustainability is central to our business model and our management team. We are proud of our role in the

circular economy and our ability to grow the sustainability of our business alongside financial performance. To
continue to drive this forward, we have identified clear, quantifiable long-term sustainability goals for 2025 and 2030.
These goals include the following:

155


-----

    - _Climate Change: By 2030, our goal is to have reduced GHG Emissions by 30% (emissions in 2020_
equaled 0.495 tCO2 emissions per ton);

    - _Waste Reduction and Recovery: By 2030, our goal is to have reduced the total amount of waste generated_
per ton of net saleable product by 18% (total waste per ton of net saleable product in 2020 was
181 kilograms per ton) and have increased the proportion of waste sent for recovery to 90% (proportion
of waste recovered in 2020 was 73%);

    - _Water: By 2030, our goal is to have reduced wastewater discharge per ton of net saleable product by_
20% (wastewater discharge per ton of net saleable product in 2020 was 11.06 cubic meters per ton);

    - _Employee Wellbeing:_ By 2030, our goal is to have increased the employee advocacy rate to 4.5 (the
employee advocacy rate in 2020 was 3.98);

    - _Diversity: By 2030, our goal is to have increased the percentage of female employees by 30% (in 2020,_
9.5% of our employees were women); and

    - _Responsible Sourcing of Materials: By 2025, our goal is to have implemented a new program to assess_
and qualify all of our key suppliers for all relevant product categories according to ESG criteria.

Additionally, this Offering is sustainability-linked, with a Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. Our

Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework includes Sustainability Performance Targets for the most material
indicators for our business for 2025. These are:

      - _Climate Change: By the end of 2025, our goal is to have reduced GHG Emissions by 15% (from_
the 2020 baseline of 0.495 tCO2e/ton);

      - Waste: By the end of 2025, our goal is to have increased the proportion of waste sent for recovery
to 86.2% (from the 2020 baseline of 72.8%); and

      - _Water: By the end of 2025, our goal is to have reduced wastewater discharge per ton of net saleable_
product by 16.6% (from the 2020 baseline of 11.06 m3/ton).

**_Pursue disciplined investments in key focus areas._**

We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize and to grow our asset base, with a focus on disciplined

investments that we believe will strengthen our pan-European presence and support the achievement of our strategic
goals. In addition, we will also continue to explore means to strengthen and to extract greater value from our existing
operations, which may include investments in other related sectors within the circular economy or along the circular
economy value chain in which we operate. For further detail, see also “—Our Production Process—Circular Business
_Model.” We believe we have a well-invested asset base today and have a history of investing our capital responsibly_
and with a strong return on investment, and have proven our ability to successfully integrate acquired assets.

**Our History**

Our history dates back to 1967, when Cartiere del Reno was founded in Italy, in Bologna. Cartiere del Reno

subsequently followed a path of steady growth and expansion, through the acquisition of industrial plants (including
the Ovaro production plant, in 1985) and corporate transactions (such as the acquisition of Cartiera Binda De Medici,
in 1986). In 1986, Cartiere del Reno changed its name into Reno De Medici S.p.A.

In the following years, our strategy further developed through the mergers with the Italian company Saffa in

1997 and the Spanish company Sarrio in 1998.

Concurrently, Casades Inc. had been founded in Canada in 1964, operating as a cartonboard manufacturer,

and had been active in Europe since 1985, when they had acquired their first European production site at La Rochette,

156


-----

as well as additional European facilities in France, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. We began trading our
shares on the Milan stock exchange in 1996, as a result of our initial public offering.

In 2008, RDM and Cascades Europe Group combined their manufacturing plants in a newly formed company

which continued to operate under the name RDM and combined their sales activities in another entity named Careo
Group. In 2017, RDM, Cascades La Rochette and Careo Group merged into a single entity: the RDM Group.

As part of the implementation of a three-year transformation plan between 2018 and 2021, we have been

focusing on the integration of our pan-European asset base under a “multi-mill” and “multi-country” concepts in the
WLC and SB market segments and transformed RDM into a truly unified “One Company,” through a portfolio of
value added initiatives. As part of such plan, we acquired the following companies:

    - in 2017: PAC Service S.p.A., an Italian company operating in the field of cutting and processing
cardboard. This acquisition allowed us to (i) reinforce our supply chain integration strategy, (ii) smooth
through-the-cycle raw material prices, and (iii) further expand our presence in Italy;

    - in 2018: Barcelona Cartonboard SAU, a Spanish company operating in the coated cartonboard sector.
This acquisition allowed us to (i) strengthen our recycled cartonboard presence, (ii) broaden our
production capacity, and (iii) increase our proximity to key European converters (our customers);

    - in 2021: Papelera del Principado S.A. (“Paprinsa”), a Spanish company operating in the recycled WLC
business. This acquisition allowed us to (i) solidify our leading WLC position in Southern Europe, (ii)
support our multi-mill approach, and (iii) increase our potential for production capacity;

    - in 2021: Fineska Group (“Eska”), a Dutch company leader in high-quality SB. This acquisition allowed
us to (i) enlarge our recycled fiber-based production, (ii) expand our product offering through presence
in the SB market, (iii) enhance RDM brand recognition in the high margin luxury packaging business,
(iv) expand our global presence and (v) implement our “multi-mill” strategy in combination with the
Italian Ovaro mill.

Also, in 2021, the full divestment of our interests in the French former subsidiary R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S.

(“La Rochette”), which used to be our only company operating in the market of FBB—consisting in cartonboard for
folding boxboard based on virgin fibers—allowed us to focus on our two core market segments, being WLC and SB
ones. See below “—Investments and Divestments” for further detail.

In October 2021, Apollo acquired a majority stake in the Group and subsequently launched a public tender

offer on all our remaining shares. In December 2021, the tender offer was completed and our shares were delisted
from the Milan stock exchange.

Following completion of our transformation plan, we continue to implement our “multi-mill” concept and

focus on the integration of the various acquired companies into our operations and the achievement of related synergies
and cost savings through several initiatives in the following specific areas: recipe and portfolio optimization,
procurement, labor, energy efficiencies, price alignments, value engineering and digitalization.

In July 2023, we acquired Fiskeby International Holding AB (“Fiskeby”), a Swedish producer of recycled

paper board to become the largest producer of WLC in Europe. This acquisition allowed us to (i) grow our market
share in the recycled cartonboard market and become the largest independent recycled cartonboard producer in
Europe, (ii) enhance the security of our supply, (iii) expand in attractive markets such as United Kingdom, Baltics and
Poland and achieve geographical diversification towards northern Europe, (iv) serve pan-European customers in a
multi-mill reinforced approach, (v) improve our cost structure with Fiskeby’s waste-to-energy plant that shelters the
mill from any volatility in the energy markets, (vi) use the higher technical performance of Fiskeby’s cartonboard
products, such as the multiboard offset in high grammages, to compete with producers of virgin fiber cartonboard,
(vii) strengthen our sustainability profile, (viii) increase our exposure to the food segment with premium quality
cartonboard; (viii) improve visibility on volumes by leveraging Fiskeby’s direct relationship with brand owners; and
(ix) reduce our carbon footprint, as the Fiskeby’s mill uses alternative sources of energy.

**Market Segments and Products**

We manufacture different types of recycled cartonboard, sold as sheets or rolls. In particular, our products

cover two market segments: (i) WLC, representing approximately 79% of our business as of December 31, 2023 (after
giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) in terms of production capacity, and including both WLC and liner
(coated board products), and (ii) the SB market segment, representing approximately 21% of our business as of
December 31, 2023 (after giving _pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) in terms of production capacity. By_
focusing on these two types of products and market segments (WLC and SB), we are able to serve primarily essential
and resilient end-markets (such as the food, beverage and pharmaceuticals end-markets for WLC products, and the
bookbinding, puzzles and games end-markets for SB products) which are characterized by low customer concentration
and high growing applications in the luxury laminated packaging. See also “Industry.”

All our products are derived from, and based on, recycled fibers, and we operate a circular economy business

model. See also “—Our Production Process—Circular Economy” and “—Environmental, Social and Governance
_(ESG) matters.”_

For the year ended December 31, 2023 (after giving _pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition), we_

developed a production capacity of approximately 1,705 thousand tons of products, we produced approximately 1,027
thousand tons of products, we had €844.6 million Adjusted Pro Forma Revenues from Sales and we generated €157.7
million Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA. Excluding our Blendecques mill, our total production capacity for
the year ended December 31, 2023 would have been approximately 1,600 thousand tons of products.

**_Our WLC Segment_**

WLC is a type of coated cartonboard used for the production of folding cartonboard packaging and liner

packaging from recycled fibers. Our main WLC output is used to produce cartonboard boxes for food packaging,
detergent and pharmaceutically supported beauty products. Separately, our liner products are a specific WLC-based
product category that is primarily used for general packaging and display purposes, and to line corrugated packaging
for shipping boxes.

The folding cartonboard products are made of: (i) coating layers, (ii) two to three internal layers, primarily

produced from recycled fibers and (iii) pigmented coating layers. These products are predominantly used in the food,
hygiene and cleaning, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, electronics, textile and toy industries. The liner products, which
are used for corrugated packaging, are made of: (i) optional coating layers, (ii) one to three internal layers, primarily
produced from recycled fibers and (iii) optional back coating layers. These products are predominantly used in the
food, pharmaceuticals, IT and electronics, textile, display and microflute industries.

The below chart gives an overview of these two sub-categories and their predominant use, where the use of

liner packaging is represented by the display category.

WLC is produced on board machines in several stages. Firstly, a dilute suspension of cellulose fiber (pulp)

in water is formed into a thin layer of entangled fibers on a moving plastic mesh, known as the wire. Some of the
water is extracted by drainage and further layers of pulp are added to enhance the grammage, thickness and
composition of the cartonboard. The rest of the water is extracted by pressing and drying, a process during which
inter-fiber bonding develops and the board is formed. The board is usually coated to improve the whiteness,
smoothness and surface finish for printing, varnishing and the general appearance. Finally, there are a number of
finishing operations such as slitting, reeling, sheeting, labelling, palletizing and wrapping with moisture resistant
material for storage and distribution. For further information on our production process, see also “—Our Production
_Process.”_

Our production capacity in our WLC segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma

effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition) was approximately 1,345 thousand tons, representing approximately 79% of our
total production capacity for that same year. According to RDM Group’s analysis based on data provided by a global
management consulting company, we are the largest non-integrated WLC producer in a fragmented European market,
with a market share of approximately 27% by volume sold (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition
and including our Blendecques mill).

Our WLC products are primarily sold to manufacturers of packaging, producing for a wide variety of end
markets, we also see increasing opportunity to work directly with brand owners to accelerate packaging sustainability

and plastic substitution. The graph below illustrates the end-markets for our WLC products for the year ended
December 31, 2023 (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition).

Source: Company information.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition, we generated

€622 million revenue from sales in our WLC segment (as compared to €942 million for the year ended December 31,
2022 after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition), which constituted 73% of our total revenue from sales
for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as compared to 70% for the year ended December 31, 2022). Additionally, for
the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated 88% of our EBITDA in our WLC segment (after giving pro forma
effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition), as compared to 80% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**_Our SB Sector_**

With the Eska Acquisition, the production capacity of our SB sector increased significantly, and SB products

evolved from a minor part of our portfolio to representing a key component of our product offering. As of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, according to RDM Group’s analysis based on data provided by a global management
consulting company, we are the largest non-integrated producer of SB in Europe (excluding integrated producers of
SB and SB based products and converters operating in Europe).

SB is primarily used for luxury and food packaging, publishing applications (bookbinding) and graphical

applications, such as for puzzles and games. Our SB output can be currently divided in two categories, being
“specialties products” and “Eska products:”

    - The specialties products are made of: (i) one to six board plies (i.e., thin layers) laminated, (ii) base plies
coming 100% from recovered fibers, and (iii) a high variety of board thickness. The specialties products
weigh typically from 350 to 3400 g/m2 and are predominantly used in the food and luxury packaging
industries.

    - The Eska products are currently manufactured by Eska for certain end-markets with stringent
requirements and are made of: (i) one to three board plies laminated, and (ii) base plies coming 100%
from recovered fibers. The Eska products are typically slightly more than 1.0mm thick, and their weight
generally varies from 600 to 2500 g/m2. They are predominantly used in the luxury packaging,
bookbinding, stationery and puzzles and games industries.

160


-----

By the end of 2024, all our SB products will be sold under the Eska brand, with our specialties products

becoming a subcategory dedicated to “tailor made” products.

The below chart gives an overview of SB and its four predominant end-uses.

Source: Company information.

Our production capacity in our SB sector for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 360

thousand tons, representing approximately 21% of our total production capacity for that same year. As such, we are
among the top three European manufacturers by capacity of SB.

Our SB products are primarily sold to manufacturers of packaging operating for a wide variety of end
markets. The below graph illustrates the end-markets for our SB products for the year ended December 31, 2023.

161

Source: Company information

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated €230 million revenue from sales in our SB sector,

which constituted approximately 27% of our total revenue from sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**Our Production Process**

**_Circular Business Model_**

Our production plants operate in the context of the circular economy and we believe that our activities have

a positive impact on the environment throughout the whole life cycle of cartonboard production. We believe that we
are strong contributors to the circular economy, with which we have a symbiotic relationship. We are committed to
upholding this continuous, virtuous and sustainable production cycle for the long term. All of our products are fully
recyclable, enabling them to be converted to packaging at a later stage. Furthermore, for the year ended December 30,
2023, approximately 95% of the fibrous materials we used came from recycled materials and over 84% of all materials
used consisted of renewable materials, enabling us to foster the circular economy.

Operating in a circular economy is key to our business model, replacing the idea of “waste” with the concept

of “resource.” This regenerative system is based on the efficient use of raw materials, giving them a new lease on life.
We believe that we are key to the circular economy itself, being the “link in the chain” between production of
cartonboard and PfR, because we transform PfR into different types of cartonboard, which is then transformed into
packaging by our clients and, in turn, more than 95% of the packaging produced by our clients is recycled on average
after use. Adopting a circular approach means looking beyond the initial production cycle and embracing greater
responsibilities to our society and environment. See also “—Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters.”

The below graphic illustrates how our circular economy operates and functions.

162


-----

The main steps of our manufacturing process can be described as follows:

    - We source PfR in the form of used fiber-based packaging, newspaper and magazines from local
industrial and commercial companies and from local municipal paper collection, as well as industrial
waste from converters. Our technology and production systems transform the PfR into cartonboard,
giving the recycled fibers a new life.

    - The fiber-based raw materials are mixed with water to create a cellulose fiber suspension (i.e., a pulp of
cellulose fibers), and the impurities (e.g., sand, metals and plastics) present in the raw materials are
eliminated through a complex purification system.

    - The pulp suspension is formed in the wet section of the production process to a fiber web board and then
further pressed and dried to remove the water and, depending on the type of cartonboard, a coating layer
may be applied to it.

    - Once produced, the cartonboard is rolled onto special reels for direct dispatch or cut into sheets and
packaged onto pallets.

Our products are primarily intended for the converting and printing industry, using our cartonboard to make

the packaging for the products placed on the market. Clipping and scraps resulting from the converting and printing
processes are collected and delivered back to the mill, either directly or through sorting facilities as raw materials. As
for the products that are delivered on the market, once the final consumers have used them, more than 95% of the
packaging is eventually reintroduced into the virtuous cycle of recycling, thereby feeding the sustainable business
model of recycled cartonboard.

In addition in 2022, we implemented strategic initiatives for the management and improvement of the quality

of the water used in the production from the mills of Hoogezand, Santa Giustina and Barcelona, that allow us to recycle
the process water. In 2023, we invested in the development of the Ovaro power plant. These successful initiatives
further improved our water efficiency and contributed to strong operational performance. We have also started

163


-----

building a new CHP plant in Barcelona to further reduce our GHG Emissions and achieve cost savings, which we
expect will be completed in the end of the second quarter of 2024.

**_Raw Materials_**

For the production of products in our WLC and SB sectors, we rely on raw materials, the main ones being

PfR and virgin market pulp. Our cartonboard is fully recyclable and designed to be reintroduced into the paper circular
economy cycle after use, and it is biodegradable if it is not properly disposed of or recycled. To produce our products,
we rely on PfR (95%), virgin market pulp (5%) applied only on some specific stiff requirement products, and over
84% of all materials used consists of renewable materials (after giving pro forma effect to the Fiskeby Acquisition).

In addition, all our plants are certified according to FSC® and/or PEFC standards, which are the two most

widespread and globally recognized standards for ensuring that raw materials come from a chain-of-custody controlled
supply chain. For our virgin market pulp supplies, we choose only certified and/or controlled raw materials from
sustainable supply chains. In particular, 100% of all virgin market pulp that we use (after giving pro forma effect to
the Fiskeby Acquisition) is FSC® or PEFC certified, or FSC® controlled wood.

In order to have a consistent and adequate supply of raw materials, we typically enter into multi-year

agreements, as customary in our industry. In certain countries, such as Germany, The Netherlands and United
Kingdom, the supply for PfR is granted through certain procurement agreements. We are also part of a number of
yearly purchase agreements, which are renegotiated on a yearly basis. In Italy, we are member of the National
Consortium for the Recovery and Recycling of Cellulose-based Packaging (“Comieco”) and such membership grants
us certain guaranteed supply quantities at a fair market price.

Changes in raw material prices may impact our results of operations and while we generally do not have

clauses for the pass through of input costs predefined in our sales contracts, we have historically been able to pass
through increases in these costs through the regular renegotiation of contracts with our customers. Conversely, our
customers generally expect price reductions when our input costs decrease. Generally, the price adjustments do not
occur simultaneously with commodity price fluctuations but after negotiations between us and our customers.
However, we have recently changed our pricing methodology to allow us to set the price for products at the time of
delivery as opposed to the time of order, which reduces the time discrepancy between the increases in raw material
prices and the selling prices of our products, and we have also adopted a disciplined pricing policy to maintain strong
contribution margins in deflationary environments. In the year ended December 31, 2023, this resulted in stable
contribution margins above pre-COVID levels despite the soft market backdrop. See “Risk Factors—Our business
_depends on the continued and uninterrupted supply of raw materials used in our products. If we are unable to secure_
_sufficient quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials rises, it could negatively affect our ability to meet_
_our customers’ demands and materially adversely affect our financial results.”_

_“Multi-Mill” Concept_

As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we have ten mills (including Blendecques) across six European

countries: France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. In order to address the continued
underperformance of the Blendecques mill, we are currently considering strategic alternatives and currently intend to
cease operations at the Blendecques mill by the second half of 2024. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Closure
_of the Blendecques mill.”_

We adopted, and operate under, our “multi-mill” concept which refers to one of our core operating principles,

which is that we aim to produce similar products in multiple mills whenever possible so as to ensure that our products
are available to our customers, regardless of their proximity to a specific production site, in a flexible and punctual
manner notwithstanding any changes in market demand or the economic cycles of the individual countries in which
we operate. We believe that the quality of our production assets is high, in terms of capacity, technical age, speed and
trim, which enhances our ability to effectively pursue our multi-mill concept. Our multi-mill concept also facilitates
our development of a consolidated multi-country asset base, providing a closer geographic proximity to a number of

164

key clients which, among others, allow us to timely address their change in needs. Overall, we believe that this
approach helps to increase customer satisfaction. See above “Summary—Pan-European, strategic asset base close to
_customers providing significant competitive advantages.” The following graphics depicts a summary of our operating_
facilities as of December 31, 2023.

intend to cease operations at the Blendecques mill by the second half of 2024. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Closure of the
_Blendecques mill.”_

(8) Villa Santa Lucia plant was on standstill from August 2022 to December 2022 and then from July 2023 to March 2024, due to the unforeseen
overhaul of the area’s municipal effluent treatment plant in 2022 and the local Italian court decision to revisit the case and further review its
operations in 2023. Following extensive discussions with local authorities, on March 4, 2024, the Villa Santa Lucia mill resumed operations.
See “Summary—Recent Developments—Re-opening of the Villa Santa Lucia mill.”

The “multi-mill” concept is supported by an integrated business planning process that uses centralized digital

tools to align forecasted demand with the available capacity of the mills.

Source: Company information

We successfully implemented the same multi-mill strategic approach to Eska, which we acquired in 2021, in

the solidboard market and Fiskeby, which we acquired in 2023, in the packaging board market. See “—Investments
_and Divestments.”_

_The Sheeting Centers_

Each of our mills has the capacity to perform the cutting activity through which our products are made in the

size and format requested by our clients. In addition, we have four sheeting and distribution centers that focus on
cutting activities and serve as warehouses. Two sheeting and distribution centers are located in Italy, near Milan
(R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l.) and near Padova (PAC Service S.p.A.), respectively. The activities performed in these two
centers consists of cutting cartonboard sheets in the format required by clients from cartonboard reels. The activities
conducted by R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l. and by PAC Service S.p.A. are slightly different. R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l. operates
as a service provider of the Group, receiving reels of products from other RDM facilities, cutting them and then
delivering them to the final customers. R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l. also provides this kind of service to a limited number
of external customers. PAC Service S.p.A., instead, buys reels (half of which are manufactured by RDM at our mills,
and the rest is acquired at arms-length), cuts them into small, customized lots and is able to deliver them to clients
within 48 hours. Customers generally pay more for the kind of service offered by PAC Service S.p.A. vis-à-vis the
ordinary purchase of cartonboard. We also own an additional sheeting center in Spain (Eska Sheeting Center
Barcelona), which is equipped to cut sheets to the required size and to repackage them for shipment to clients. Eska
Sheeting Center Barcelona also has a stock of customer specific boards which can be cut to size and quickly delivered
to clients when needed. Finally, we operate one sheeting center in the U.S. (Eska Sheeting Center in Suffolk, Virginia)
which, like Eska Sheeting Center Barcelona, has a warehouse where a broad range of top-selling and customer-specific
board is kept in stock and this stock can then be cut and quickly delivered to clients when needed.

_Our Sales Network_

We have ten sales offices spread across nine European countries for the WLC segment and three sales offices

in two European countries, and one outside Europe, for the SB segment, some of which also sell products to
neighboring countries. Most of our sales are directly managed by our employees from the sales offices. In order to
penetrate those geographic areas, which are not physically close to our sales offices, we employ certain agents that
report to our relevant sales offices. We also have a sales back-office organization spread around Europe to support our
sales organization. This allows us to coordinate our sales through our own sales network, which supports our main
European and overseas country markets and addresses the multiple needs of our customers, ensuring widespread
coverage and sales globally.

_Transportation and Distribution_

We predominantly rely on external service providers to ship our products. The transport companies that we

use are chosen at a local level from each local head of logistics and the terms that govern our relationships are
customary for the industry. We usually enter into ex-works transportation contracts, pursuant to which ownership of
the property is transferred when the purchaser takes the goods.

In addition, each of our facilities has a head of logistics who manages transportation at a local level.

**_Our Customers and Stakeholders_**

_Customers_

As of December 31, 2023, we had over 2,500 customers, serving several blue-chip companies such as Tod’s,

Nestle, Danone, McDonalds, Gucci, Bauli, Caffè Vergnano, Melegatti and Heineken. As of December 31, 2023, our
top customer represented 4% of our total revenue, with our top 10 and top 100 customers representing 22% and 64%
of our total revenue, respectively.

167


-----

Our business relationships with our customers are generally based on yearly budget agreements and purchase

orders, rather than long-term contracts. Through the budget agreements, our clients set targets of products they expect
to need each year, committing to buy certain volumes from us. These budget agreements allow us to forecast the
production volume needed to satisfy most of our clients and allow these clients to place recurring orders whenever
they need. However, through Fiskeby we also enter into long-term agreements with some of our brand partners. These
agreements usually include a volume rebate threshold mechanism that makes the traded volume more secure. The
model of our contractual relationships with customers gives us flexibility to respond to market conditions and allowed
us to successfully pass on eight price increases from January 2021. Following an encouraging order intake at the
beginning of 2024, we have recently announced a price increase starting from March 2024.

_Stakeholders_

We adopt a multi-stakeholder approach and are in constant dialogue with our internal and external

stakeholders. This dialogue is a decisive tool for us and our operations, as it enables us to better address the challenges
posed by the external context and make better decisions regarding business development and the management of our
impact on the environment and the wider society. The chart below depicts the overview of our various stakeholders.

In addition, the below materiality matrix summarizes the results of a continuous engagement activity that

analyses the current and future expectations of our multiple stakeholders and resulted in the identification of 15
material topics. The matrix reflects the topics of greatest relevance and priority to our business based on the result of
an assessment that includes several factors, such as risks, opportunities, strategy and market trends, in order to build
a balanced analysis. We recently updated our matrix to incorporate a “double-materiality” analysis by our senior
management, taking into account the potential financial impact of each topic. Our materiality matrix was also used as
the baseline to establish our long-term sustainability goals for 2020—2030 (see also “—Environmental, Social and
_Governance (ESG) matters”)._

**_Strategic Initiatives_**

We identified various cost-saving and improvement initiatives that could booster our profitability in the

coming years. These initiatives include:

    - Investing and implementing operational excellence plans in our mills with the goal of improving
operational efficiencies from machinery upgrades and new equipment, ensuring better quality and higher
production volumes, decreasing variable costs and reducing waste. As of December 31, 2023, we
realized €4.1 million of aggregated cost savings through these initiatives, out of €16.8 million of
aggregated cost savings and expected to be generated in full by the end of 2028.

    - Dedicating capital expenditures to energy use management, including investments in co-generation
plants and other energy equipment, as the majority of our capital expenditures are spent on energyrelated items and energy is a material driver of our cost structure. As of December 31, 2023, we realized
€5.6 million of aggregated synergies through these initiatives, out of €20.3 million of aggregated
synergies identified and expected to be generated in full by the end of 2028.

    - Developing commercial and cost synergies with the recently acquired Paprinsa, Eska and Fiskeby
businesses, including (i) with respect to Paprinsa, through optimization of the manufacturing process,
reduction of procurement and labor costs, increasing energy efficiencies and adding a third shift to
increment sales and volumes, (ii) with respect to Eska, through price alignment and portfolio
optimization as well as capacity increase, and (iii) with respect to Fiskeby, through price re-positioning,
cross-selling, alignment of the overall equipment effectiveness to the Group and sustainable value
generation. As of December 31, 2023, we realized €15.0 million of aggregated cost savings and synergies
through these initiatives, out of €23.0 million of aggregated cost savings and synergies identified and
expected to be generated in full by the end of 2028.

    - Implementing our lean manufacturing philosophy by investing in digital tools, such as process analytics,
maintenance, quality integration, procurement, pricing, and supply chain saving through digitalization.
As of December 31, 2023, we realized €2.5 million of aggregated cost savings through these initiatives,
out of €3.7 million of aggregated cost savings and expected to be generated in full by the end of 2024.

    - To further improve innovation and customer satisfaction, we launched a program for the creation,
through an ERP, of a unique integrated platform for the order-to-cash management of all customer orders

169


-----

across the mills (the “TIETO TIPS”). We are currently working on a detailed roll-out plan with the aim
of implementing the TIETO TIPS in all our mills by the end of 2027. The TIETO TIPS will allow us to
ensure greater homogeneity, in line with our “multi-mill” concept, streamline operations, improve
efficiency, and ultimately enhance the overall customer experience from the processing of the order to
the offering of support services.

**_Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters_**

Environmental responsibility is a critical pillar of our corporate identity and business model. We believe that

we are a sustainable development player with a circular economy vision (see also “—Our Production Process—
_Circular Economy”) and we have already identified clear sustainability long-term goals for 2030 (the “Sustainability_
**Plan 2020-2030 Goals”). Our management team has demonstrated its ability to manage and grow our business, adapt**
to changing market conditions, undertake strategic investments and integrate innovative technology to our production
processes.

We look to grow our environmental positive impact by focusing on reducing GHG Emissions, increasing our

proportion of waste sent for recovery and reducing wastewater discharge, as well as increasing the use of recycled
cartonboard as an alternative to less sustainable packaging, such as plastic. The charts below illustrate our long-term
objectives with respect to GHG Emissions, waste sent for recovery and wastewater discharge.

Source: Company information, ICMA, Sustainalytics. The Framework and SPO can be found on the website at www.rdmgroup.com.

(1) Calculated using SBTi methodology.

In defining our long-term sustainability goals, we focus on precise objectives of great relevance to our

business and society as a whole. We believe that the pursuit of these objectives can lead to achievement of other
environmental, social, ethical and economic objectives.

We are committed to continuously upgrading our processes to ensure the efficient management of our energy

resources, and to use cleaner fuels more efficiently to reduce GHG Emissions.

We work to improve our production processes to optimize the use of water and to reduce the amount of waste

generated per ton of production. We are currently in the process of collecting all the relevant information to subscribe
a commitment letter with SBTI, the Science Based Target Initiative, a collaboration between the CDP (it was the
Carbon Disclosure Project), the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Once the commitment letter is signed, we will have two years to submit new GHG
Emissions reduction targets validated by SBTI. The below outlines our Sustainability Plan 2020-2030 Goals.

Our commitment to long-term sustainability goals has been reinforced with the issuance in 2021 of the

Existing Notes, which feature certain interest rate step-ups in case we are unable to achieve the following sustainability
targets by the end of 2025: a 15% reduction in GHG Emissions, an increase in the proportion of waste sent for recovery
to 86.2%, and a 10% reduction in specific wastewater discharge, in each case compared to the respective 2020 baseline
levels. This commitment will be confirmed with the issuance of the Notes, which will feature interest step-ups for the
following sustainability targets: a 15% reduction in GHG Emissions by the end of 2025, a 18% increase in the
proportion of waste sent for recovery by the end of 2025, and a 16.6% reduction in specific wastewater discharge by
the end of 2025, in each case compared to the respective 2020 baseline levels. While the GHG Emission sustainability
targets for the Notes remain the same as the Existing Notes, the waste sent for recovery and wastewater discharge
sustainability target has been made more ambitious compared to those in the Existing Notes. We believe that efficient
resource management is crucial to achieve these goals. For this reason, in 2022, we invested in a high-efficiency power
plant in Ovaro, Italy, installed three new steam boilers in Hoogezand, Netherlands, including one e-boiler, and carried
out investments to improve the recovery system of process water to reduce the amount of water withdrawn and
discharged. The mills of Sappemeer in The Netherlands and Fiskeby in Sweden also use anaerobic wastewater
treatment technology to treat their own wastewater and generate biogas. In 2023, we also started building a new CHP
plant in Barcelona that we expect to be completed by the second quarter of 2024, which we expect will reduce our
carbon emissions.

Furthermore, we believe that our production process and our facilities contribute to the achievement of the

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”). Namely, while in our daily activities we continuously aim
at generally improving our ESG-related practices and specifically complying with and contributing to the entire group
of SDGs, we have identified some practices and policies that we believe contribute to their achievement, including:

(i) our behavior-based safety program implemented at five of our mills contributes to SDG 3,
promoting occupational health and safety;

(ii) our investments in technical and vocational training and skill development contributes to SDG 4,
promoting continuous learning and skills development. In 2023, we invested €850 thousand in these
projects;

171


-----

(iii) the significant decrease in the use of water in our operations as part of our long-term commitment
to reduce specific wastewater discharges contributes to SDG 6, protecting the water ecosystems.
Since 2021, we reduced specific water discharges by 15%;

(iv) our goal to use renewable and clean energy across all our operations contributes to SDG 7,
increasing the energy efficiency of operations. Since 2020 we reduced our energy intensity by 7%;

(v) our adoption, whenever possible, of national collective agreements that guarantee good working
conditions contributes to SDG 8, promoting full employment and decent work. Over 2,300 people
have found employment opportunities with our Group;

(vi) the successful launch of an operational excellence manufacturing program at four of our mills to
increase modernization and sustainability contributes to SDG 9, modernizing industrial processes
to make them more sustainable;

(vii) the use of renewable, recyclable and recycled products contributes to SDG 12, adopting sustainable
patterns of production and consumption. 95% of our fiber-based materials are sourced from recycled
paper;

(viii) our significant investments to increase the efficiency of our own combined heat and power (“CHP”)
plants and cartonboard production processes contribute to SDG 13, taking action to combat climate
change and its impacts. In 2022, we completed our CHP plant in Ovaro, Italy, while we aim to
complete our CHP plant in Barcelona, Spain, in 2024;

(ix) our sourcing of virgin market pulp entirely from certified and/or controlled sources that ensure
compliance with a sustainable management of forests contribute to SDG15, promoting a sustainable
management of forest-related resources; and

(x) our participation in more than 30 local and international associations to support innovation in our
sector contributes to SDG 17, aiming at strengthening partnerships for a sustainable development.

We have also increased our emphasis on integrating ESG considerations into our decision-making process

by establishing, in 2022, a dedicated ESG Committee. The ESG committee has the following duties and
responsibilities in the areas of environment, sustainability and governance: (a) proposing, supporting and updating the
Board of Directors on relevant sustainability issues; (b) monitoring the implementation of the strategy, actions,
performance, objectives and sustainability key performance indicators and assessing their consistency with the targets
and the international best practice; (iii) reviewing, with the support of the internal departments, the sustainability report
and non-financial information and submitting them to the Board of Directors for the approval; and (iv) assessing
potential risks and business opportunities by monitoring the applicable regulatory framework, the external scenarios
and the specific sector dynamics. See “Management—The Issuer—Board Committees.”

In addition, we are also a member of various associations and working groups, locally and internationally,

that support innovation and sustainable development of the fiber-based packaging industry and recycling sector. For
example, we are an active member of “4evergreen”, an alliance that brings together companies across the fiber-based
packaging value chain who are committed to increasing circularity and sustainability, and Pro Carton, a European
association of carton and cartonboard manufacturers whose goal is to promote the use of carton and cartonboard as an
economically and ecologically-balanced packaging medium. Mr. Bianchi, our Chief Executive Officer was appointed
as President of Pro Carton in October 2022.

Finally, most of our production facilities are located in the European Union. Therefore, we are regulated

under various EU, national and local laws relating to environmental regulation, occupational health and safety and
other regulatory matters. Our operations are subject to comprehensive laws and regulations relating to water effluents,
air emissions, discharge and disposal of materials into the environment; the generation, registration, storage, handling,
use and transportation of chemicals; the protection of natural resources and endangered species, and the remediation

172


-----

of soil contaminated with hazardous chemicals that might be accidentally released during the course of our operations,
with the long-term goal of permanently reducing accidents.

**_Health and Safety_**

Health and safety are integral values of our business activities and we are working to achieve full ISO 45001

certification at all our mills. We have adopted a “Zero Accident” policy and promote a safety culture at all levels, in
order to prevent dangerous situations and reduce the likelihood of accidents in all our facilities. We want all employees
to be satisfied and to work safely. To do so, we encourage collaboration between workers and management and
empower our employees to promote everyone’s wellbeing. In 2022, we achieved a “Zero Accident” safety
performance at the mill of Ovaro and the sheeting centers PAC Service and Eska Board Ibérica SAU, and a low
accident rate at our remaining production sites.

We adhere to a health and safety policy that promotes the highest standards of safe facilities operation to

prioritize the health of our employees and third parties. In order to ensure and monitor compliance with our health and
safety policy we:

    - measure our health and safety performance;

    - assess our processes in order to reduce risks and to seek continuous improvement in health and safety
practice and performance;

    - maintain management systems that help to protect employees, visitors, contractors and the public from
injury or ill-health; and

    - take all reasonably practicable steps to develop a positive safety culture throughout our Group;

    - deliver safety training to our employees; and

    - starting from 2022, implement safety programs to promote best practices across all sites.

Safety is managed by operational functions at each mill who, before 2022, reported directly to the chief

operating officer. Starting from 2022, we enhanced our safety governance structure by dedicating a full-time
managerial position to health and safety. The appointment of a health and safety manager aims at improving the
integration of safety across all sites, deploying safety programs and ensuring the adoption of plans for the improvement
of health and safety.

**_Research and Development_**

Our focus on innovation allows us to strengthen our product portfolio by focusing on renewable, recyclable

and recycled solutions. We believe that the growing preference for sustainable products, along with increasing
regulatory actions against the use of plastics and plastic packaging, will increase the demand for sustainable
alternatives to plastic, such as WLC packaging made from recycled fibers that we produce. In line with the latest
market trends, we are directing our development activities toward solutions that can replace products made of plastic
materials and are safe to be used for food products. We focus our efforts on renewable and recyclable barrier solutions
that are fully integrated with the fiber-based material structure of the cartonboard. In doing this, we aim at promoting
and preserving the integrity of the packaged product, while maintaining the recyclability of the coated cartonboard
after its use. We are also currently developing a portfolio of new sustainable solutions to be rolled-out between 2025
and 2028, which we expect will increase our production volumes by more than 300 thousand tons per year. We are
committed to increase transparency in sustainability. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the external validation of
the carbon footprint of our products and undergoing a third-party life cycle assessment. These activities will allow us
to evaluate sustainability claims and prioritize product initiatives with higher sustainability score.

We have consistently pursued research and development activities to ensure the constant improvement of

production processes and product innovation. This is achieved through collaboration among our product innovation

and development department, our production team, the most important European research centers in the industry and
through partnerships with some of our customers.

The below chart illustrates our project innovation focus areas:

Source: Company information.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

Our manufacturing facilities are located across Europe. Our production mills and sheeting centers comprise

the majority of our asset base (See also “—Our Production Process—Production Facilities”).

We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our business purposes for the foreseeable future.

Ongoing productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on upgrading and
modernizing facilities to reduce costs and improve efficiency and productivity. These actions reflect our continued
commitment to realign manufacturing facilities to maintain our competitive position in the markets in which we
operate. We continually review our operations and evaluate strategic opportunities.

The Group’s headquarters are located at Viale Isonzo 25, 20135 Milan, Italy. We own the property of all our

mills, the PAC Service sheeting center and our WLC sales office in Spain. We rent our headquarters, RDM Magenta
sheeting center and all our sales offices except the one in Spain.

**_Investments and Divestments_**

From time to time, we enter into material acquisitions and distribution insourcing transactions, which grow

our business both vertically and horizontally, increasing our presence and capacity in our core segments. From time
to time, we also divest certain assets or business operations to focus on our core segments. The following paragraphs
describe our most significant acquisitions and disposals finalized in the recent past.

_Paprinsa Acquisition (2021)_

We acquired Paprinsa in July 2021 for an enterprise value of €31 million. Paprinsa is one of the main

European players in the WLC sector. It operates a mill with one of the lowest technical ages (10-15 years) and the
largest trim width (4.8 meters) on the market. Paprinsa is specialized in the production of cartonboard from recycled
fibers (WLC), microflute and corrugated sheets, serving the packaging industry in Spain and abroad. Paprinsa’s mill
is utilizes one of the most up-to-date technology in Europe due to significant investments between 2015 and 2021,
including more than €30 million of capital expenditures. Because it also has one of largest trim widths (4.8 meters) in
Europe, it gives us the opportunity for future production growth. Overall, this acquisition allowed us to (i) consolidate

174


-----

our leading WLC position in Southern Europe, (ii) support our multi-mill approach, and (iii) increase our potential for
capacity via an additional shift we have added in the plant. We also created a dedicated team and a task force to ensure
a smooth and successful integration following the acquisition of Paprinsa.

_Eska Acquisition (2021)_

We acquired Eska in July 2021 for an enterprise value of €155 million. Eska is a Dutch company and the

world’s leading pure-play provider of high-quality SB, operating as long-term partner to more than 700 customers
globally. It operates two industry-leading production facilities in The Netherlands (the Hoogezand and Sappemeer
mills). See “—Our Mills.” The two Eska facilities have the largest combined production capacity in Eska’s core market
segment, SB. This acquisition allowed us to enlarge our recycled fiber-based SB production, to expand our product
offerings and to leverage our multi-mill concept in the SB sector, in which we can now operate with three plants. The
Eska Acquisition will also broaden our geographical presence, extending our coverage in the Asian and American
markets and giving us further EU exposure in the key Nordic market. We also created a dedicated team and a task
force to ensure a smooth and successful integration following the Eska Acquisition.

_La Rochette Disposal (2021)_

In April 2021, we sold RDM La Rochette, the only company of our group operating in the FBB market, for

an enterprise value of €28.8 million. The rationale of this divestment was to leave the FBB market in order to focus
on WLC and SB. La Rochette did not represent a competitive asset in our portfolio in terms of quality, technology
and capacity relative to best-in-class manufacturers of FBB. Investing in La Rochette would have been expensive and
would not have yielded an attractive return on investment for the Group.

_Fiskeby Acquisition (2023)_

In July 2023 we acquired Fiskeby, for an enterprise value of €150 million. Fiskeby is a Swedish producer of

high-quality recycled cartonboard mainly for the food industry (using liquid packaging and other coated fibers as raw
materials), and the leading and sole WLC mill in Scandinavia. This acquisition allowed us to (i) grow our market
share in the recycled cartonboard market and become the largest independent recycled cartonboard producer in
Europe, (ii) enhance the security of our supply, (iii) expand in attractive markets such as United Kingdom, Baltics and
Poland, (iv) serve pan-European customers in a multi-mill reinforced approach, (v) improve our cost structure with
Fiskeby’s waste-to-energy plant that shelters the mill from any volatility moves in the energy markets, (vi) use the
higher technical performance of Fiskeby’s board to compete with producers of virgin fiber cartonboard, and (ix) reduce
our carbon footprint, as the Fiskeby’s mill uses alternative sources of energy such as a waste combustion from its
waste-to-energy plant generating over 70% of energy consumption of the Fiskeby Group. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, the Fiskeby Group generated approximately €101 million of revenues from sales and
approximately €22 million of EBITDA, and incurred in approximately €2.9 million of maintenance capital
expenditures. As of December 31, 2023, Fiskeby Group’s mills had an overall capacity of 170 thousand tons and the
Fiskeby Group employed over 260 employees. Given its strategic geographic position, Fiskeby’s main customers are
based in Sweden (21%), Germany (21%), Poland (14%) and the United Kingdom (10%).

We believe that we have a qualified workforce with appropriate educational backgrounds. We invest in

training, enhancing knowledge sharing and informal learning tools and we believe that the skills and knowledge of
our employees are a strategic resource In addition, we stimulate teamwork, collaboration between different generations
and cultures, and sharing of experiences and opinions. To facilitate this, we have created:

    - our “Change Management Steering Committee” to promote positive change at all organizational levels
and in any business area; and

    - our “Youth & Restyling Committee” to put forward proposals on how to integrate the vision of millennials
and younger generations into our management style and strategic goals.

In addition, we consistently assess the technical, digital and soft skills of our employees and offer tailored

training to all professional categories. For example, in 2022 we launched a specific program for employees that have
been promoted to middle and senior manager roles, to enhance leadership skills and provide personalized guidance.
In addition, in 2023 we implemented a training program on cybersecurity, to educate users on best practices and
techniques to prevent and mitigate cyber threats.

As part of our Sustainability Plan 2020-2030 Goals, we intend to increase the percentage of women employed

by us by 30%. See also “—Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters.” As of December 31, 2023, 11.4%
of our direct employees were women, which represents an increase of 19.6% compared to 9.5% in 2020. As part of
our training strategy, we also employ new graduates and prepare them within our institution for managerial positions.
Our graduated interns represented 17% of our total employees as of December 31, 2023 (as compared to 16% as of
December 31, 2022).

Our workforce is characterized by modest fluctuation levels and the average job tenure of our employees is

approximately 17 years.

We believe that we offer our employees competitive compensation packages and a dynamic work

environment that encourages initiative and is based on merit. As a result, we have generally been able to attract and
retain qualified personnel. To promote a dynamic and meritocratic work environment, we have adopted a performance
incentive system in which bonuses are granted according to the achievement of certain personal goals and measurable
company objectives including, for the senior managers, long-term sustainability goals.

We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced

any material labor disputes in the past.

Our employees, not including interim or provisionary employees, are spread across Italy, France, the Iberian

Peninsula, Germany and the rest of Europe. The below table includes the geographical split for the periods indicated.

to property (including buildings, plants, machinery and stock, including as a result of catastrophic events such as fire,
flood, storms and earthquakes), industrial accidents, third-party liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, and cybercrime. We run a loss prevention program with the aim of assessing our operational risks and take action to prevent
any potential business interruption event. This program is carried out consistently with our all-risk insurance policy
and assesses whether our insurance is adequate for our business risks and whether the developments in our insurance
policies reflect of the changing needs of our business. Moreover, managing operational risks though a group-wide loss
prevention program enables us to reduce our risk exposure alongside mitigating our insurance costs.

**_Legal Proceedings_**

We are from time to time subject to legal proceedings of civil and administrative legal proceedings and we

make special provisions to cover possible losses related to these legal proceedings. We do not currently have any
pending material legal proceedings other than the following ones: (i) a criminal action for illegal trafficking of waste
brought against certain former employees, a consultant and a senior representative of RDM arising from the same
seizure of the landfill located at Villa Santa Lucia plant; (ii) a criminal action for manslaughter after a fatal accident
occurred at the Ovaro plant in 2018; (iii) certain commercial and administrative disputes, such as the pending litigation
with the Municipality of Cassino (Frosinone) about the payment of certain environmental taxes for the years between

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING AND GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of our significant indebtedness after giving effect to the Transactions does not_

_purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified by, the underlying documents. Unless otherwise defined in this_
_Offering Memorandum or unless the context requires otherwise, terms defined in the Revolving Credit Facility_
_Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement will have the same meanings when used in this section._

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Agreement Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Offering, on March 21, 2024, the Issuer as original borrower and original guarantor,

the arrangers and the agent party thereto and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as security agent have entered into a super
senior revolving facilities agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of

€100 million on a committed basis. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower
under the Revolving Credit Facility in euro, sterling and US dollars or certain other currencies by the drawing of cash
advances, the issue of bank guarantees and similar instruments (including letters of credit and performance bonds)
and/or by way of ancillary facilities. Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at
any time. The borrowings will be available to be used (i) for refinancing, defeasing, replacing, cash collateralising,
back-stopping or otherwise discharging (including on a cashless basis) the Existing Revolving Credit Facility or
certain other indebtedness of the Group and paying any breakage costs, redemption premium, make-whole costs and
other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection thereto; and/or (ii) financing or refinancing any other related
amounts, including fees, costs, premium, taxes (including stamp duty), expenses and other transaction costs incurred
in connection with (i) above; and/or (iii) for financing or refinancing the general corporate and working capital
purposes of the Group.

All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to closing of the Offering and other customary

conditions.

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contemplates the incurrence of additional uncommitted revolving

facilities in a maximum amount not to exceed (together with the initial revolving commitments) the greater of €100
million and 100% of EBITDA whether as a new commitment or facility or as an additional tranche of any existing
facility or by increasing the commitments under an existing facility. Such additional facilities may rank _pari passu_
with or junior (but not senior) in right of payment to the Revolving Credit Facility. The lenders of any such additional
facilities shall not have the benefit of (x) guarantees from any member of the Group which is not an Obligor (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or (y) security over assets other than the Transaction Security (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), except where the same security (to the extent permitted by law) is granted
in respect of the other facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any additional facility will be those agreed between the

Issuer and the relevant lenders of that additional facility, provided that no additional facility may have a maturity date
that is earlier than the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility, except where the lenders the Revolving Credit
Facility are offered the same earlier maturity date.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized

from and including the Closing Date (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) until the date falling one
month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

186


-----

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer is the original borrower and original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility. A mechanism

is included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to accede as a
borrower and/or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain conditions. The Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement also requires that each company in the Group as is necessary to ensure that the Guarantor Coverage
Test (as defined below) is met becomes a guarantor within a certain period after the Closing Date (subject to agreed
security principles) and in the future certain other entities as needed for the Guarantor Coverage Test to be met will
also need to become guarantors (subject to agreed security principles).

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (1) the date that is 4.5 years after the Closing Date

and (2) the date falling six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. Each advance will be repaid on the last day of
the interest period relating thereto, subject to a customary netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such
date. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on the maturity date for the
Revolving Credit Facility.

Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-borrowed

during the availability period for that facility, subject to certain exceptions.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the rate per annum equal to

the aggregate of the applicable margin and EURIBOR, or in relation to cash advances in sterling, SONIA, or in relation
to cash advances in U.S. dollars, SOFR (as each term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). The
initial margin under the Revolving Credit Facility will be 3.50%. Provided no Event of Default (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in respect of non-payment, insolvency or breach of the financial covenant has
occurred and is continuing, the margin on the loans may be reduced if the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio
(as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) is within a certain range.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit

Facility from (and including) the Closing Date (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) to (and
including) the last day of the availability period for the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate equal to 30% of the
applicable interest rate margin. The commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the
availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full
or on the date on which a lender cancels its commitment. No commitment fee shall be payable unless the Closing Date
occurs.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay the agreed agency fees to the agents in connection with the Revolving

Credit Facility and will pay any separately agreed upfront fees or underwriting fees to the mandated lead arrangers in
connection with the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Guarantees_**

Subject to Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations under applicable laws, the Issuer and

the other Obligors that accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from time to time will provide senior
guarantees of all amounts payable to (x) the Finance Parties (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)
by the Issuer as original borrower and original guarantor, or as applicable, any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries which
accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as an additional borrower or an additional guarantor and (y) the
hedging banks under certain secured hedging agreements (pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement).

187


-----

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles), within a certain

period after the Closing Date, such subsidiaries of the Issuer as is necessary to ensure that the guarantors represent not
less than 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and any Material
Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction (which will
comprise Italy, Germany and The Netherlands)(the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) will be required to become
guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing initial Guarantor
Coverage Test will be satisfied by the Accession Date Additional Guarantors becoming guarantors under the
Revolving Credit Facility.

Furthermore, if on the last day of each financial year of the Issuer, the Guarantor Coverage Test is not met,

within 120 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant financial year, other subsidiaries of the
Issuer (subject to agreed security principles and certain other exceptions) are required to become guarantors until the
Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on the last
day of the relevant financial year).

**_Security_**

It is expected that from and after the Closing Date, the Notes (subject to agreed security principles) will be

secured by the same collateral that secures the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in the section entitled
“Description of the Notes—Security; the Collateral.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the collateral (whether or

not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Notes.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties (with

certain representations and warranties being repeated), subject to certain customary materiality, knowledge and other
qualifications, exceptions and baskets, including: (i) status; (ii) binding obligations; (iii) non-conflict with
constitutional documents, laws or other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v) validity and admissibility in
evidence/authorizations; (vi) governing law and enforcement; (vii) insolvency; (viii) no default; (ix) financial

interests; (xvii) sanctions and anti-corruption; (xviii) no filing or stamp taxes; (xix) center of main interests; (xx) pari
_passu ranking; and (xxi) anti-terrorism._

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related

definitions (with certain customary adjustments) that apply to the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility
also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for transactions of this type. Set forth below is a
brief description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, knowledge or other
qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

**_Affirmative Covenants_**

annual audited and quarterly financial statements (in a manner consistent with the reporting to be provided to the
holders of the Notes) and compliance certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance with laws; (iv) payment of taxes;

Revolving Credit Facility are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the Indenture.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

The Issuer is required to notify the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement upon becoming

aware of a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), including the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Group whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, following
which each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is entitled to notify the Issuer requiring repayment
of all outstanding amounts owed to that lender and the cancellation of that lender’s commitments.

**_Financial Covenant_**

The Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant providing that the Issuer shall ensure that the

Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in respect of each
testing period (beginning after three full financial quarters have elapsed after the Closing Date) shall not exceed 8.0:1,
which shall not be tested unless the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) exceeds 40% of the
greater of (x) the Total Revolving Facility Commitments (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) at
the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and (y) the Total Revolving Facility Commitments outstanding
on such a financial quarter end date.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for some of the same events of default, with certain

customary adjustments, as under the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for certain customary
events of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or
grace periods. The events of default include: (i) failure to pay amounts when due subject to grace periods; (ii) failure
to comply with the financial covenant, subject to equity cure rights; (iii) failure to comply with any other provision of

comply with a material term of, or breach of representation or warranty by certain parties under, the Intercreditor
Agreement subject to a 30 business day grace period and (viii) repudiation and rescission.

**_Governing Law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law provided that the information

undertakings, negative covenants, events of default and New York law definitions listed in the relevant schedules to
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New York.

**Agreement”) dated on or about the Issue Date. By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to**
have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have
authorized the Trustee (the “Senior Secured Notes Trustee”) and the Security Agent to enter into the Intercreditor

Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement
because it, and not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes. Unless expressly
stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, and/or the Indenture (the “Senior Secured Notes Indenture”), the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.

Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Intercreditor

Agreement.

**_Parties_**

The initial senior secured parties (together the “Senior Secured Parties”) will include, among others, the

agent under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “Senior Agent”), the Security Agent, the lenders, issuing banks and
ancillary lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “RCF Lenders”), the arrangers of the Revolving Credit
Facility, and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also allow for accession by (1) creditors of future loan or bond indebtedness

(that are not subordinated in right of payment to any Super Senior Liabilities (as defined below) or Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities) incurred by the Issuer and/or the Debtors which is permitted, under the terms of the Revolving Credit
Facility documents, the documentation governing any other Super Senior Lender Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Notes documents, to share in the Transaction Security shared by the Senior Secured Parties (the “Future Pari Passu
**Debt”) and (2) (A) hedge counterparties party to certain interest rate or foreign exchange hedging agreements that are**
secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Hedging Agreements”) (the “Super Senior Hedging Banks”)
by virtue of being designated as such and (B) hedge counterparties party to hedging exposure with respect to any
Super Senior Lender Liabilities, any Senior Secured Note Liabilities or any Future Pari Passu Debt, other than the
Super Senior Hedging Agreements (the “Pari Passu Hedging Agreements”) (the “Pari Passu Hedging Banks” and,
together with the Super Senior Hedging Banks, the “Hedging Banks”) and the providers of Operating Facilities which
are secured on a pari passu basis. Holders of Future Pari Passu Debt and such Hedging Banks and such operating
facilities providers are also Senior Secured Parties.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also allow for accession by creditors of future loan or bond indebtedness

incurred by the Issuer and/or the Debtors which is permitted under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility
documents, the documentation governing any other Super Senior Lender Liabilities and the Senior Secured Notes
documents, to share in the Transaction Security shared by the Senior Secured Parties on a junior ranking basis, and
provided further that such future indebtedness complies with agreed parameters for the relevant class of such future
indebtedness set out in the finance documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility. Any such future indebtedness
that is:

(1) subordinated to the debt owing to the Senior Secured Parties (the “Senior Secured Debt”) and
complies with agreed parameters for second lien debt set out in the finance documents relating to
the Revolving Credit Facility shall be “Future Second Lien Debt” for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement. Holders of Future Second Lien Debt are “Future Second Lien
**Creditors;”**

(2) subordinated to the Senior Secured Debt, ranked after the Future Second Lien Debt in terms of any
recoveries from Transaction Security which such future indebtedness is permitted to share and
complies with agreed parameters for unsecured debt set out in the finance documents relating to the
Revolving Credit Facility shall be “Future Unsecured Debt” for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement. Holders of Future Unsecured Debt are “Future Unsecured Creditors;” and

(3) subordinated to the Senior Secured Debt, ranked after the Future Second Lien Debt in terms of any
recoveries from Transaction Security which such future indebtedness is permitted to share and
complies with agreed parameters for senior subordinated debt set out in the finance documents
relating to the Revolving Credit Facility shall be “Future Senior Subordinated Debt” for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement. Holders of Future Senior Subordinated Debt are “Future
**Senior Subordinated Creditors.”**

There will be a single Security Agent appointed to act at all times on behalf of all Senior Secured Parties,

Future Second Lien Creditors, Future Senior Subordinated Creditors and Future Unsecured Creditors.

Neither the Issuer nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (each a member of the “Group”) nor any shareholder

of a member of the Group which is not otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of the Senior
Secured Parties, Future Second Lien Creditors, Future Senior Subordinated Creditors or the Future Unsecured
Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured, will be party to the Intercreditor Agreement save for:

191


-----

(i) any shareholder of the Issuer in respect of any existing or future loan made to the Issuer (each a
“Shareholder Subordinated Lender”) (and the Intercreditor Agreement will contain subordination
provisions and restrictions relating to the receivables owing from the Issuer to any Shareholder
Subordinated Lender (the “Shareholder Liabilities”)), and

(ii) certain members of the Group that lend to a Debtor (each an “Intragroup Lender”) that will in
certain circumstances accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the loans or
indebtedness owing from such Debtor to such member of the Group in respect of intra-group loans
(the “Intra-Group Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Agreement will contain subordination provisions
relating to any Intra-Group Liabilities. However, Debtors will not be prohibited from incurring,
amending or making payments in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities until an acceleration event
under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or other relevant debt)
is continuing.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the present and future moneys, debt, liabilities and obligations

(“Liabilities”), as the case may be, in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility
**Liabilities”) and other Super Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes**
**Liabilities”), the Future Pari Passu Debt (the “Future Pari Passu Liabilities”), the amounts owing to the Super**
Senior Hedging Banks under the Super Senior Hedging Agreements (the “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities”) and
the amounts owing to the Pari Passu Hedging Banks under the Pari Passu Hedging Agreements (the “Pari Passu
**Hedging Liabilities”), the amounts owing under the Operating Facilities (the “Operating Facility Liabilities”) and**
certain costs and expenses of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (the “Senior Secured Trustee Liabilities”), the
arrangers of Senior Secured Debt that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Priority Arranger Liabilities”)
and the creditor representatives of Senior Secured Debt that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Priority
**Creditor Representative Liabilities”) will rank equally (without preference among them) in right and priority of**
payment and in priority to the liabilities of the Debtors, as the case may be, in respect of the Future Second Lien Debt
(the “Future Second Lien Liabilities”), Future Senior Subordinated Debt (the “Future Senior Subordinated
**Liabilities”), Future Unsecured Debt (the “Future Unsecured Liabilities”), the arrangers other than Priority Arranger**
Liabilities (the “Non-Priority Arranger Liabilities”) and the creditor representatives other than the Priority Creditor
Representative Liabilities (the “Non-Priority Creditor Representative Liabilities”), the Intra-Group Liabilities and
the Shareholder Liabilities.

The Future Second Lien Liabilities, the Future Unsecured Liabilities, the Future Senior Subordinated

Liabilities, the Non-Priority Arranger Liabilities and the Non-Priority Creditor Representative Liabilities will rank
equally (without preference among them) in right and priority of payment, and in priority to the liabilities of the
Debtors, as the case may be, in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Liabilities. The Intra-Group
Liabilities will rank in right and priority of payment senior to the Shareholder Liabilities.

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement shall provide that the Transaction Security shall rank and secure the following

liabilities in the following order (and subject to the proceeds of such security being distributed in accordance with the
Payments Waterfall, as defined below):

    - **first, the Revolving Credit Facility Liabilities and other Super Senior Lender Liabilities, the Super Senior**
Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the
Operating Facility Liabilities, the Future Pari Passu Liabilities, the Priority Arranger Liabilities, the
Priority Creditor Representative Liabilities and the Senior Secured Trustee Liabilities; and

    - **second, the Future Second Lien Liabilities, the Future Unsecured Liabilities, the Future Senior**
Subordinated Liabilities, the Non-Priority Arranger Liabilities and the Non-Priority Creditor

192


-----

Representative Liabilities, in each case to the extent that the Transaction Security is stated to secure such
Liabilities.

If security is to be granted for Future Pari Passu Debt then, to the extent such Future Pari Passu Debt cannot

be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Debt without existing security first being released, the parties
to the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Parties”) agree that such Future Pari Passu Debt will (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional security documents securing the same assets subject
to the relevant security on a second- or lesser-ranking basis and such Future Pari Passu Debt will nonetheless be
deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu with
Senior Secured Debt which would otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated above and any amounts to be
applied towards such Future Pari Passu Debt shall be applied accordingly. In the event that it is not possible to permit
the recreation of additional security documents as referred to above, no amendments or release of security under the
existing security documents shall be permitted unless permitted under the documents thereby secured (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the retaking of any such security as required by the relevant secured document), or if not so
permitted under a specific document, without the consent of the required creditors under that document.

If security is to be granted for Operating Facility Liabilities then, to the extent such Operating Facility

Liabilities cannot be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Debt without existing security first
being released, the Parties agree that such Operating Facility Liabilities will (to the extent permitted by applicable
law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional security documents securing the same assets subject to
the relevant security on a second- or lesser- ranking basis and such Operating Facility Liabilities will nonetheless
be deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu
with Operating Facility Liabilities which would otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated above and
any amounts to be applied towards such Operating Facility Liabilities shall be applied accordingly. In the event
that it is not possible to permit the recreation of additional security documents as referred to above, no
amendments or release of security under the existing security documents shall be permitted unless permitted
under the documents thereby secured (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the retaking of any such security as
required by the relevant secured document), or if not so permitted under a specific document, without the consent
of the required creditors under that document.

If security is to be granted for Future Second Lien Debt then, to the extent such Future Second Lien Debt

cannot be secured on a second ranking basis behind the Senior Secured Debt and/or on a pari passu basis with other
Future Second Lien Debt without existing security first being released, the Parties agree that such Future Second Lien
Debt will (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional security
documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a lesser-ranking basis and such Future Second
Lien Debt will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by
such security as contemplated above and any amounts to be applied towards such Future Second Lien Debt shall be
applied accordingly. In the event that it is not possible to permit the recreation of additional security documents as
referred to above, no amendments or release of security under the existing security documents shall be permitted
unless permitted under the documents thereby secured (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the retaking of any such
security as required by the relevant secured document), or if not so permitted under a specific document, without the
consent of the required creditors under that document.

If security is to be granted for Future Unsecured Debt then, to the extent such Future Unsecured Debt cannot

be secured on a subordinated basis to the Senior Secured Debt and/or on a pari passu basis with other Future Unsecured
Debt without existing security first being released, the Parties agree that such Future Unsecured Debt will (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional security documents securing
the same assets subject to the relevant security on a lesser-ranking basis and such Future Unsecured Debt will
nonetheless be deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security as
contemplated above and any amounts to be applied towards such Future Unsecured Debt shall be applied accordingly.
In the event that it is not possible to permit the recreation of additional security documents as referred to above, no
amendments or release of security under the existing security documents shall be permitted unless permitted under
the documents thereby secured (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the retaking of any such security as required by
the relevant secured document), or if not so permitted under a specific document, without the consent of the required
creditors under that document provided that in no event shall any security be granted to secure the Future Unsecured

193


-----

Liabilities unless such security is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Debt documents, the Future Pari Passu Debt
documents or any Future Second Lien Debt documents to be granted in favor of the Future Unsecured Liabilities.

If security is to be granted for Future Senior Subordinated Debt then, to the extent such Future Senior

Subordinated Debt cannot be secured on a subordinated basis to the Senior Secured Debt and/or on a pari passu basis
with other Future Senior Subordinated Debt without existing security first being released, the Parties agree that such
Future Senior Subordinated Debt will (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution
of additional security documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a lesser-ranking basis and
such Future Senior Subordinated Debt will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement to be secured by such security as contemplated above and any amounts to be applied towards such Future
Senior Subordinated Debt shall be applied accordingly. In the event that it is not possible to permit the recreation of
additional security documents as referred to above, no amendments or release of security under the existing security
documents shall be permitted unless permitted under the documents thereby secured (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the retaking of any such security as required by the relevant secured document), or if not so permitted under a
specific document, without the consent of the required creditors under that document provided that in no event shall
any security be granted to secure the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities unless such security is not prohibited by
the Senior Secured Debt documents, the Future Pari Passu Debt documents or any Future Second Lien Debt documents
to be granted in favor of the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities.

Equivalent provisions to the three paragraphs above are included in the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of

additional credit facilities that are to benefit from a similar position under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to
that of the Revolving Credit Facility. See the section entitled “General” below.

**_Payments and Prepayments; Senior Secured Debt_**

and (ii) Enforcement Action for purposes of this paragraph (b) shall not include action taken to

waiver or permitted remedy thereof).

If an event of default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of such fact)

any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to enforcement) relying solely
on that event of default shall cease to continue.

**_Restrictions on Enforcement by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt; Standstill_**

Prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured Debt and all the Future Second Lien Debt, neither the Future

Senior Subordinated Debt Representative nor the holders of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt may take
Enforcement Action with respect to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt without the prior consent of or as required
by an Instructing Group (as defined below), except if:

(a) an event of default under the debt documents for the Future Senior Subordinated Debt is continuing;

(b) the Senior Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Debt and the Future Second
Lien Debt have received notice of the specified event of default from the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Representative;

(c) a Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired or is otherwise
terminated; and

(d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Future Senior Subordinated Standstill
Period, provided that no such Enforcement Action may be taken if the Security Agent is taking
Enforcement Action or acting in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group to take
steps for Enforcement and such proposed Enforcement Action in relation to the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt documents might reasonably be likely to adversely affect such Enforcement
Action or Enforcement by the Security Agent.

A “Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the Future

Senior Subordinated Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice on the Senior Agent and the other
representatives of the Senior Secured Debt and the representative of any Future Second Lien Debt until the earliest of:

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action, provided that (i) the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative and holders of Future Senior Subordinated Debt may only take
the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Security Agent and may not

204

take any other Enforcement Action against any other member of the Group or Third Party Security
Provider and (ii) Enforcement Action for purposes of this paragraph (b) shall not include action
taken to preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider owing any Future Senior Subordinated Debt against whom Enforcement Action is to be
taken;

(d) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt in the form of notes occurs
for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt; and

(e) the expiration of any other Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period which was outstanding at
the date that the current Future Senior Subordinated Standstill Period commenced (other than as a
result of a cure, waiver or permitted remedy thereof).

If an event of default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of such fact)

any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to enforcement) relying solely
on that event of default shall cease to continue.

**_Enforcement by Holders of Senior Secured Debt_**

Prior to the date upon which all amounts (actual or contingent) owing under the Revolving Credit Facility

and other credit facilities that are Super Senior Lender Liabilities are fully discharged and paid in full and all
commitments thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (the “Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date”), the Security
Agent will (subject as further set out below and other than in certain limited circumstances specified in the Intercreditor
Agreement where the Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority Future Second Lien Creditors (as
defined below) or the Majority Future Unsecured Creditors (as defined below)) act on the instructions of (i) the RCF
Lenders, the lenders of such other Super Senior Lender Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Banks whose super
senior credit participations represent more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate super senior credit participations of all such
persons and their relevant representatives (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) to the extent the relevant
matter is prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes documents or the Future Pari Passu Debt documents, the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of Future Pari Passu Debt and the Pari Passu Hedging Banks whose aggregate
senior secured credit participations represent more than 50% of the aggregate senior secured credit participations of
all such creditors (the “Majority Senior Secured Parties”), in each case subject to the consultation period referred
to below and provided that such instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles set forth below.

Following the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date but prior to the date upon which all Senior Secured

Debt is discharged and paid in full and all commitments thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (the “Senior Secured
**Debt Discharge Date”), the Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Parties (other**
than in certain limited circumstances specified in the Intercreditor Agreement where the Security Agent will act on
the instructions of the Majority Future Second Lien Creditors (as defined below) or the Majority Future Unsecured
Creditors (as defined below)).

Following the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date but prior to the date upon which all Future Second Lien

Debt is discharged and paid in full and all commitments thereunder are irrevocably cancelled (the “Future Second
**Lien Discharge Date”), the Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority Future Second Lien Creditors**
(as defined below). Following the Future Second Lien Debt Discharge Date but prior to the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority Future Senior Subordinated
Creditors and following the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent will act on the
instructions of the Majority Future Unsecured Creditors (as defined below). In each of the scenarios outlined in the
above two paragraphs, the relevant parties giving instructions to the Security Agent shall be the “Instructing Group.”
Each Primary Creditor (other than certain creditor representatives), Shareholder Subordinated Lender and Intragroup
Lender will agree in the Intercreditor Agreement that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by or under
the supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation
or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider as instructed by the

205


-----

Security Agent (acting as directed by an Instructing Group provided that such instructions have been given in
accordance with the restrictions in the Intercreditor Agreement).

**_Consultation_**

Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date and prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent,

to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction Security and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal
and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction Security on a distressed disposal, and the taking of any other
actions consequential on (or necessary to effect) the enforcement of the Transaction Security (“Enforcement”), the
relevant representative of the Senior Secured Debt (or, to the extent that the Future Second Lien Creditors are permitted
to do so, the Future Second Lien Debt Representative or, to the extent that the Future Unsecured Creditors are
permitted to do so, the Future Unsecured Debt Representative or, to the extent that the Future Senior Subordinated
Creditors are permitted to do so, the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative) shall notify the Security Agent,
and the Senior Secured Debt representatives that the applicable Transaction Security has become enforceable. As soon
as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions to enforce
Transaction Security or take other Enforcement Action given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the
Majority Senior Secured Parties and/or Majority Future Second Lien Creditors (as defined below) and/or Majority
Future Unsecured Creditors (as defined below) and/or Majority Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (as defined
below) (as applicable), the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt,
following which, the Senior Agent or creditor representative of other Super Senior Lender Liabilities (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors), each Operating Facility Lender, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(acting on instructions of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement) and the representative of the holders of Future Pari Passu Debt will consult in good
faith with each other and the Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such
persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be
given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (the “Consultation Period”).

No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to

the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of the
Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles set
forth below (“Qualifying Instructions”)) where:

(a) any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting
the Issuer, any Third Party Security Provider, any Debtor or (prior to the discharge of the Revolving
Credit Facility) any subsidiary that is a “Material Company” under the Revolving Credit Facility
(as applicable) (each a “Relevant Company”); or

(b) the Instructing Group or, as applicable, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior
Secured Parties determine in good faith (and notifies each other representative agent of the other
Senior Secured Parties, the Operating Facility Lenders and the Security Agent) that any delay caused
by such consultation could reasonably be expected (A) to reduce the amount likely to be realized to
a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the Payment Waterfall described
below) the payments then due and payable under the Revolving Credit Facility to the RCF Lenders,
and the lenders, ancillary lenders and issuing banks under any other credit facility that ranks on a
consistent basis with the Revolving Credit Facility (together, the “Super Senior Lender
**Liabilities”) and to the Super Senior Hedging Banks in respect of the Super Senior Hedging**
Liabilities (together, the “Super Senior Liabilities”) would not be discharged in full or (B) to have
a material adverse effect on the ability to effect an Enforcement or a Distressed Disposal and, in
each case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of
the Senior Secured Parties, or Super Senior Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant Instructing
Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured

Parties have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the same.

206


-----

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes silence is

deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received from either Instructing Group by the end of the Consultation
Period (which have not be resolved), the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from
enforcing the Transaction Security and/or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the
instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Parties, in each case provided such instructions are Qualifying
Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation
Period shall be deemed revoked.

If prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date:

(a) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been repaid in full in cash within six months of the end of the
Consultation Period (or within six months of the event of default giving rise to the right to commence
an Enforcement if no such Consultation Period is required);

(b) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other
Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within three
months of the event of default giving rise to the right to commence an Enforcement if no such
Consultation Period is required); or

(c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the Security Agent has
not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that
time with respect to such Relevant Company or a Third Party Security Provider, then the Security
Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Majority Super
Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions and the Security Agent
shall be entitled to assume that any instructions for enforcement given to it are Qualifying
Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Parties (to the extent
conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Parties).

**_Security Enforcement Principles_**

Unless otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, enforcement of the Transaction Security must be

conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which are summarized as follows:

(a) It shall be the priority and over-riding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to
maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from
enforcement of the Transaction Security, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor
Agreement, the recovery by the RCF Lenders and the lenders of other Super Senior Lender
Liabilities, the Hedging Banks, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Future
Pari Passu Debt, the Operating Facility Lenders, the holders of the Future Second Lien Debt (to the
extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure such debt) and the holders of the Future
Unsecured Debt (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure such debt) (the
“Security Enforcement Objective”) subject to applicable law.

(b) The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Required Holders (as
defined below), the Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders (as defined below) and (to the extent
relating to the definition of Security Enforcement Objective or paragraph (a) above) the Majority
Future Second Lien Creditors.

(c) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will, subject to
applicable law, be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either (1) all
proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for
distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (2) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement
will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in

207


-----

accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in
full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(d) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a
member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds a threshold (or its
equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of
the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent
shall (unless such enforcement or sale is made pursuant to a public auction, a public offering or
process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion
from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or
other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of
businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be
enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the
Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective and maximize recovery,
(B) that the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of view after taking
into account all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the
Security Enforcement Principles, provided that the provider of such opinion may limit its liability
in respect of such opinion to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

(e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice
of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Turnover_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that if any Primary Creditor (as defined below) receives or

recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security except in accordance with the “Application of
_Proceeds/Waterfall” described below, that it will (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case_
of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee):

received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay
an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities
owed to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the

proceeds of any guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility or other Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes, Future Pari Passu Debt, Operating Facility Liabilities, Future Second Lien Debt and/or Future Unsecured Debt
(the “Senior Guarantee Liabilities”) except in accordance with the “Application of Guarantee Proceeds/Waterfall”
described below, that it will (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee):

    - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor (or if less, the amount
received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay
an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed

208

to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

Unsecured Creditor, Shareholder Subordinated Lender or Intragroup Lender receives or recovers any payment or
distribution not permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or applied other than in accordance with the “Application
_of Proceeds/Waterfall” described below, that it will (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the_
case of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee):

the definitions of certain terms therein. Capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” section and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.

The Issuer will issue the notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of €590 million. Following the Issue

Date, the Issuer may issue additional notes from time to time as described below under “—Additional Notes.”

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

The notes will be, upon issuance:

    - general senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - secured as set forth under “—Security; the Collateral;”

    - equal in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future Indebtedness and other obligations that
are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, including the obligations
under the Credit Agreement;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that will receive proceeds
from any enforcement action over the Collateral on a priority basis, including the obligations under the
Credit Agreement;

221


-----

    - effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by
assets that do not secure the notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

    - structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer’s existing and future
Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes as set forth under “—Guarantees;” and

    - senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s future Subordinated Indebtedness.

The Guarantees of each Guarantor in respect of the notes will be:

    - a general senior obligation of such Guarantor;

    - secured as set forth under “—Security; the Collateral;”

    - equal in right of payment to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future Indebtedness and other
obligations that are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, including

Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes as set forth under “—Guarantees”; and

    - senior in right of payment to any of such Guarantor’s future Subordinated Indebtedness.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock by

the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the issuance of Preferred Stock by the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries,
such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Under certain circumstances, the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial amounts of Indebtedness, and such Indebtedness
may be secured Indebtedness. The Indenture will not limit the amount of Indebtedness that any direct or indirect parent
company of the Issuer may incur or the incurrence of liabilities that do not constitute Indebtedness. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—We may incur additional indebtedness, including at the level of our_
_non-Guarantor subsidiaries, which could increase our risk exposure from debt and could decrease your share in any_
_proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency or other winding-up of such subsidiaries,” “—Certain_
_Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of_
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”_

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the notes, any

Guarantee and the Indenture would also constitute Collateral. All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the

_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, guarantees and security may be limited or capped and certain assets will not

be pledged in relation to the notes (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles,
including (without limitation):

    - if providing such security or guarantee would be prohibited or limited by general legal or statutory
limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance (including under Article 2358 and/or 2374 of the
Italian Civil Code), corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, foreign exchange laws or regulations (or
analogous restrictions), transfer pricing, earnings stripping, controlled foreign corporation, thin
capitalization, exchange control and capital maintenance rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar matters or providing such guarantee or
security would be outside the applicable pledgor’s capacity or conflict with fiduciary duties of directors
or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the
potential to result in material risk of personal or criminal liability of any director or officer of the Issuer
or any of its Subsidiaries after the use of reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and
without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome such prohibitions or obstacles
(to the extent reasonably practicable);

    - if the time and cost of providing the guarantee or security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to
the holders of the notes. In particular, it is acknowledged that the Issuer and/or Guarantor will not opt
(where possible) for the _Imposta Sostitutiva_ regime pursuant to Article 15 and subsequent of Italian
Presidential Decree no. 601/1973, as amended and supplemented from time to time. Accordingly, Italian
security that requires payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured obligations
will not be taken unless it can be executed by way of exchange of correspondence or minimized upon
execution (including by converting quotas of Italian limited companies into shares or through a cap to
the secured obligations agreed between the Security Agent and the Issuer, each acting reasonably). NonItalian security that requires payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured
obligation will not be taken if tax duty cannot be minimized upon execution (including through a cap to
the secured obligations agreed between the Security Agent and the Issuer, each acting reasonably);

    - if a class of assets includes material and immaterial assets and the cost involved in creating security over
the immaterial assets is not proportionate to the benefit, only the material assets in that category will be
subject to security;

223


-----

- if in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical or disproportionately costly or would
unduly disrupt the business of the Group to grant a guarantee or create security over certain categories
of assets, guarantee will not be granted and/or security will not be taken over such assets;

- if any assets or member of the Group are subject to legal requirements, contracts, leases, licenses or any
other third party arrangements which may prevent those assets from being charged or such member of
the Group from providing a guarantee provided that the relevant member of the Group will use
commercially reasonable endeavours (for a specified period of time) to obtain any necessary consent to
charging any such assets or providing a guarantee if the Security Agent (acting in good faith) specifies
prior to the date of the security document that a relevant asset or guarantee is material and the Issuer is
satisfied that such endeavours will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy, or
otherwise, will be excluded from any relevant security;

- if providing such security or granting such guarantee requires consent before such assets may be secured
or where providing such security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any
rights, benefits and/or obligations of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of those assets or
require any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to certain
conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors (but without
adverse impact on relationships with third parties);

- if providing such security or granting such guarantee would have a material adverse effect (as determined
in good faith by the Issuer) on the ability of the Issuer or any Subsidiary to conduct its operations and
business in the ordinary course as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture, or materially adversely
affects the tax arrangements of the Issuer or such Subsidiary or any direct or indirect equityholder of the
Issuer, and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take
or not take any other action shall be subject to this principle provided that the relevant member of the
Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact
on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle;

- if security over such assets or guarantee from such person is required to support acquired indebtedness
to the extent such indebtedness is not restricted by the Indenture, or if the terms of the documentation
governing such acquired indebtedness prevents the granting of such security or guarantee;

- if the time and cost (including material adverse tax consequences or adverse effects on interest
deductibility and stamp duty, registration taxes, notarisation and registration fees) of providing a
guarantee or security (and the terms or perfection of such security) is disproportionate to the benefit of
obtaining such guarantee or security;

- no member of the Group will be required to grant security or guarantees if it is not a Wholly Owned
Subsidiary of the Issuer or to the extent that to do so is not within their legal capacity or where to do so
would conflict with the fiduciary duties of directors or contravene any legal prohibition, contractual
restriction or regulatory condition or would result in (or in a risk of) personal or criminal liability on the
part of any director or officer, provided that the relevant entity shall use commercially reasonable
endeavours to overcome any such obstacle;

- the Group will not be liable for any fees, costs, taxes, expenses or other amounts payable in connection
with any re-taking, re-registration, re-notarization or other requirement for perfection, presentation,
novation or protection of security or guarantees on transfers or assignments by the holders of the notes;

- if the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or limited to minimise fees and duties
where the benefit of increasing the guarantee or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such
fees and duties;

- any Security Document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified if required by law in
order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence or for the document to bear

224


-----

a “certified date” as a matter of Italian law and where possible, the transaction security documents
governed by Italian law will be executed by way of exchange of correspondence (scambio di
_corrispondenza commerciale), or outside Italy, in order to minimise any documentary tax cost connected_
with their execution;

    - if the assets are located outside a jurisdiction in which the Issuer or a Guarantor is incorporated (the
“Security Jurisdictions”);

    - (i) all security interests (other than as set forth in subclauses (ii) and (iii) below) shall be governed by
the law of, and secure only assets located in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor
of the security interest; and no action in relation to security interests (including any perfection step,
further assurance step, filing or registration) will be required in jurisdictions where the grantor of the
security interest is not incorporated; (ii) security interests over shares shall be governed by the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the issuer of those shares to the extent such jurisdiction is a Security
Jurisdiction; and (iii) security interests over an intercompany loan shall be governed by the law
governing such intercompany loan to the extent it is a Security Jurisdiction;

    - in the case of security from or guarantees over, or over assets of, any joint venture, non-wholly owned
subsidiary or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any entity that is not wholly-owned;

    - if certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or another external body’s)
consent may be required to enable the provision of a guarantee or security;

    - certain notifications, deliverables and other notices will only be provided at the request of the Security
Agent after the notes are accelerated (subject to certain exceptions) and no notices shall be required to
be sent to insurers, third party debtors or other contractual third parties prior to an acceleration that is
continuing;

    - in the case of assets subject to security which is a Permitted Lien; and

    - no control agreements or control, lockbox or similar arrangements will be required with respect to any
deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodities accounts or other assets.

Unless contrary to applicable law, each Security Document will contain a clause which records that: (i) if

there is a conflict between the Security Document and the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement then (to the extent permitted by law and to the extent it would not prejudice the creation,
perfection, validity or enforceability of the Security created under the transaction security documents) the provisions
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, shall take priority
over the provisions of the Security Document; and (ii) notwithstanding any provision of a Security Document, but
without prejudice to the creation or perfection of the relevant security and to the undertakings of TopCo under the
Security Documents to ensure that security is at all times granted over the entire percentage of the shares in the Issuer
held by TopCo (except as otherwise permitted by the Indenture), the terms of the Security Documents shall not operate
or be construed so as to prohibit or restrict something which would otherwise be permitted or not prohibited under the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will also, to the extent legally possible, secure liabilities under the Credit Agreement, and may

secure any future hedging agreements, any additional notes and certain other future indebtedness on a pari passu basis
with the notes; provided that certain obligations (including (i) certain priority Hedging Obligations and Bank Products
and (ii) Obligations in respect of the Credit Agreement) are designated under the Intercreditor Agreement as having
super senior priority and will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals
in priority to holders of the notes pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing and
_Guarantee Agreements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “Impairment of

_Security Interest,” the Collateral may also secure other Indebtedness, including on a basis junior to, pari passu with_

225


-----

or senior to the notes, and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted to grant security over the Collateral
in connection with future issuances of their Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
including any additional notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any
proceeds received upon the enforcement over any Collateral, after the liabilities in respect of Indebtedness designated
as super senior have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in payment of all liabilities in
respect of obligations under the Indenture and the notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness incurred and secured
by the Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Agreements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens” below._

The Liens over the property and the other assets constituting the Collateral securing the notes and Guarantees

will be released automatically in any of the circumstances contemplated by the release provisions contained in the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, and the Security Agent shall take any necessary
action reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer to the extent necessary to effectuate any such release of the
Collateral subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Upon request of the Issuer and upon receipt of an
Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent in respect of such release have been
satisfied, the Security Agent shall execute, deliver or acknowledge any necessary or proper instruments of termination,
satisfaction or release to evidence the release of the Collateral permitted to be released pursuant to the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. At the request and expense of the Issuer, the Security Agent
shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release (in the form provided by the Issuer and
agreed by the Security Agent). Each of the following releases shall occur automatically without the consent of the
holders, and without any action on the part of the Security Agent, unless action is required by it to effectuate the
release in accordance with the terms of the preceding sentence:

    - if a Guarantor is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture;

    - if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - in connection with any Permitted Combination under the covenant described under “—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;”_

    - other than with respect to the pledge of shares of the Issuer upon a disposition not prohibited by the
provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales;”

    - only with respect to the security interests in respect of the entire Capital Stock of the Issuer, within a
reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in which the Issuer is the IPO Entity; provided
that such security interest so released shall promptly be granted in favor of the Notes in the event that
the Initial Public Offering does not complete for any reason;

    - pursuant to an IPO Pushdown permitted by the Indenture;

    - other than with respect to the pledge of shares of the Issuer, upon the release of the security interest
securing such Collateral under the Credit Agreement (other than in connection with discharge of the
obligations thereunder) or in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Liens” if the Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral in favor_
of the notes is released;

    - other than with respect to the pledge of shares of the Issuer, in connection with a reorganization otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

    - upon the defeasance or discharge of the notes as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge,” in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;_

    - as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;”

226


-----

    - as described under “—Impairment of Security Interest;”

    - as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

    - upon the full and final payment and performance of all financial obligations of the Issuer under the
Indenture and the notes;

    - in connection with a Permitted Parent Reorganization; and

    - as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or

imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability.”_

**Security Documents**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted (or confirmed and/or extended, as the case may be)

over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the notes and
the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into among, _inter alios, the relevant security provider, the_
Security Agent for itself and as agent for the secured parties (and with respect to the Security Documents governed
by Italian law, also as Security Representative (as defined below) and legal representative (mandatario con
_rappresentanza)), and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by Italian law, the Trustee acting for itself_
and in its capacity as the Trustee, under the Indenture and also as Noteholders’ Representative (if appointed) (as
defined below). The Security Agent will also act in the name and on behalf of the lenders under the Credit Agreement
and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the security interests in favor of such
parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable

laws, only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to enforce the
Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee (including in its role as Noteholders’ Representative, if appointed) and
the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions and since the Holders are not a party to the Security
Documents, the Holders will not, individually or collectively, be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture (including in its role as Noteholders’
Representative, if appointed), who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement)
provide to the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) instructions received from the Holders
pursuant to the Indenture in respect of the Collateral.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the notes

and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by security interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the
notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the security interests will be_
subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Future Guarantees and the Notes—Collateral and_
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Indenture must

be exercised by the Security Agent. The Holders may only act through the Trustee (including in its role as Noteholders’
Representative, if appointed), who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement)

227


-----

provide to the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) instructions received from the Holders
pursuant to the Indenture in respect of the Collateral.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the

security interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor
Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the security interest or the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security
Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral.”

**Enforcement of Security Interests**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce

the security interests. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Future Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar_
arrangements in relation to future indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Credit Agreement, the Holders, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured

by the Collateral and the Trustee (including in its role as Noteholders’ Representative, if appointed) have, and by
accepting a note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents.
Furthermore, each Holder by accepting a note will have deemed to have appointed the Security Agent as mandatario
_con rappresentanza pursuant to Article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code and as security representative (rappresentante_
_per le garanzie) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf. The creditors_
under the Credit Agreement, the Holders, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the
Trustee have, and by accepting a note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i)
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with
any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification,
amendment, confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement, release or discharge expressed to be executed by the
Security Agent in its name and on its behalf.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take any action that would have the

result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence
of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with
respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the notes, and the Issuer shall not, and shall
not permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders of the notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over
any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Liens;” _provided, that the_
Issuer and any Guarantor may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled
“—Certain Covenants—Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged,
transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the
applicable Security Document.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien

in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as
applicable, or pursuant to the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable. Subject to the
foregoing, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the
same assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral
Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) effect a Permitted Parent Reorganization; or (v) make any other change thereto
that does not adversely affect the holders of the notes in any material respect as determined by the Issuer in good faith

228


-----

and evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and the Security Agent; provided, however, that
(except where permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and holders of
other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with the Indenture), no Security Document may be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking
of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement or modification or release (followed by a substantially concurrent
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and
the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security
Agent, from an Independent Financial Advisor or investment bank of international standing which confirms the
solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by a substantially
concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (2) a certificate from the principal
financial or accounting officer of the Issuer or the Board of Directors which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement, or release, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any
qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents,
so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien
is not subject.

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the

Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions
without the need for instructions from the holders of the notes.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i)

that is not prohibited by the Indenture to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and_
either to share in the Collateral or any Lien or to rank pari passu or junior in right of payment to the notes and pari
_passu or junior in right of payment to any Guarantee (or, in the case of Indebtedness which ranks super senior with_
respect to the proceeds from enforcement over the Collateral and certain distressed disposals in accordance with the
definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens,” to provide for such super senior status with respect to enforcement
recoveries and certain distressed disposals), or (ii) the proceeds of which are used, in whole or in part, to refinance the
notes or Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (i), the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the request
and cost of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the notes, enter into one or more intercreditor
agreements or deeds with the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their
representatives) (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor
Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially similar terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favorable to the holders of the notes), including substantially similar
terms as applies to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security and
guarantees; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the
Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, a reference to the
Intercreditor Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent

on behalf of the holders of the notes to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the notes thereby; provided, however, that the Trustee and

229


-----

the Security Agent (if applicable) have received an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer certifying that such transaction
would comply with the covenant described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of holders

of the notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement: (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) to increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such
Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred not in violation of the Indenture), (3) to add
Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) to further secure the notes (including
additional notes permitted to be Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (5) to make provision for pledges of the
Collateral to secure additional notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (6) to facilitate a reorganization
otherwise permitted by the Indenture, (7) as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or (8) to make any
other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of notes in any material respect. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or as permitted by
the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into
any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a note, shall be deemed (i) to have agreed to

and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), (ii) to have
appointed, authorized and instructed the Trustee and the Security Agent as applicable to enter into, and give effect to
the provisions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and any amendment,
restatement or modification thereto as contemplated above), on each Holder’s behalf and to be bound thereby and to
perform their respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith, (iii) to
have agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of the Security Agent as security representative (rappresentante per le
_garanzie) of the Holders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code, (iv) authorized_
the Security Agent and the Trustee, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into the Security
Documents and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and exercise their respective rights
thereunder in accordance therewith, and (v) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the
Collateral in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents.

Please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the

_Collateral—Holders of the Notes will not receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral until after certain super_
_senior creditors are repaid and may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral” and “Description of_
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available to

the holders of the notes upon request and will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at the office of the Issuer.

The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to what is provided for in paragraph “—Meeting of

_Holders of the Notes” below._

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined

below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments
with respect to the notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee of
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the holder or holders thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).
For so long as the notes are Global Notes, the Issuer will make each interest payment to holders of record in the notes

230


-----

at the close of business (in the relevant clearing system) on the Business Day immediately before the due date for such
payment. If the due date for any payment in respect of any notes is not a Business Day, the holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any further
interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

Principal, interest and premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities

(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of a Paying Agent in London, United
Kingdom as specified in the Indenture. In addition, interest payments on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid
by bank transfer to the persons entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. To the
extent Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of
record of such notes on the Business Day immediately preceding,, and .

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent” and, collectively, the “Paying

**Agents”) for the notes. The initial principal Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.**

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar” and, collectively, the “Registrars”)

for the notes. The initial Registrar for the notes will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and will maintain a register
on behalf of the Issuer for so long as the notes remain outstanding reflecting ownership of the notes outstanding from
time to time (the “Register”). The Registrar will send a copy of the Register to the Issuer on the Issue Date. The Issuer
will also maintain a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Transfer Agent for the notes will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC. The Paying Agent will make payment on, and the Transfer Agent will facilitate transfers of,
notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent without prior notice to the Holders of

the notes. For so long as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish
a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com). The Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the notes.

**Issuance, Transfer and Exchange**

The notes will initially be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons, in

denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes in denominations of less than
€100,000 will not be available. The notes will be issued as follows:

    - notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date,
be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

    - notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited
with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

The Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global

**Notes.” Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have**
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of
interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification

231


-----

requirements summarized below and described more fully under “—Notices.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry
Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream,
as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

A holder of the notes may transfer or exchange the notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer

or exchange, the Registrar may require a holder of the notes, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements
and transfer documents and the Issuer may require a noteholder to pay any Taxes required by law or permitted by the
Indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any note (i) selected for redemption, (ii) for a period of
15 days prior to the sending of a notice of redemption or (iii) to be redeemed or tendered and not withdrawn in
connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

Book-Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Note of a given series may be transferred to a Person who

takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note of the same series only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Note of a given series may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of BookEntry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Note of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and such transfer is in compliance with any applicable blue sky securities
laws of any state of the United States.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon

transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a BookEntry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note
to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000

aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is
expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for
a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance
with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized
below and described more fully under “—Notices.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be

transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in
connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any

Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Definitive Registered
Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Definitive Registered
Notes to be redeemed in part;

232


-----

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable
to such Definitive Registered Notes; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the

registered holder of a note as the owner of it for all purposes.

The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any

restrictions on transfer imposed under the Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest
in any note other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly
required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, the Indenture, and to examine the same to
determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.

**Terms of the Notes**

The notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will mature on, 2029.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

Each note will bear interest at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”) of (i) three-month EURIBOR

(subject to a 0% floor) plus (ii) %, as determined by the Calculation Agent, from the Issue Date or from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for payable quarterly to holders of record at the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding each interest payment date on,, and of
each year, commencing on, 2024. Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the
Interest Period concerned divided by 360.

**_Calculation of Interest_**

From and including, 2026 (the “Step-up Date”), the interest rate on each note shall increase by either

(i) 0.125% (if one (1) Sustainability Performance Target is not certified as achieved), (ii) 0.250% (if two (2)
Sustainability Performance Targets are not certified as achieved) or (iii) 0.375% (if three (3) Sustainability
Performance Targets are not certified as achieved), to the extent the Issuer has failed to certify on or prior to the
Certification Date to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an Officer’s Certificate, which shall also include
the Assurance Letter, that it has achieved the Sustainability Performance Target(s) by the Testing Date. The Trustee
and Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the Officer’s Certificate and the Assurance Letter, shall
have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Assurance Letter or related Officer’s Certificate, verify
the attainment of the Sustainability Performance Target(s), or make calculations, investigations or determinations with
respect to the attainment of the Sustainability Performance Target(s). Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall
be required to make any onward notifications (to noteholders or any other Person) relating to the interest rate or the
Issuer having achieved (or not achieved) its Sustainability Performance Targets. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall
have no liability to the Issuer, any noteholder or any other Person acting in good faith on any Assurance Letter and
related Officer’s Certificate.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of

interest on the notes.

1. “Assurance Letter” means an assurance letter from an External Reviewer confirming whether the
Sustainability Performance Target(s) has (or have) been met.

2. “Calculation Agent” means any Person designated by the Issuer to calculate the interest rate in
respect of the notes. The initial Calculation Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.

3. “Certification Date” means April 30, 2026.

233


-----

4. “Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

5. “EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m.
Brussels time, on the Determination Date; provided that, EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If
Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date,
the Issuer will request the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone
inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as
a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination
Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in
euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for the
Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are
so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer,
to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading
European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Period will
be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then EURIBOR
for the Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding
Interest Period.

If the Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that:

(i) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(ii) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(iii) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

(iv) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital
markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(v) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to
calculate any payments due to holders of the notes using EURIBOR (each a “Benchmark Event”),

the Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent of such Benchmark
Event and the Issuer shall appoint a Rate Determination Agent and such Rate Determination Agent, acting
in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is
substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary
authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or
body or that is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or
comparable to the notes, as more fully set forth in the Indenture (and any applicable adjustment spread
required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic
prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders of the notes as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR
(the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”). The Issuer
and the Rate Determination Agent shall notify the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent in writing
at least ten (10) Business Days prior to any Determination Date of such Successor Rate in order that the
Calculation Agent and Paying Agent can confirm that they will be able to calculate the interest in respect of
the notes with such Successor Rate and, once confirmed, the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s
Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, one Business Day prior to
any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee,
the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further
enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the

234


-----

Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the
Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with
the Successor Rate which may, in its reasonable opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation
Agent to any additional liabilities or increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections. Holders
of the notes shall be bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action
or consent by the holders of the notes or the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor
Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all cases, not be less than 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the
holders of the notes of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread). Following the adoption
of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed
to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).

6. “euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that at the
relevant time have adopted the euro.

7. “External Reviewer” means a qualified provider of third-party assurance or attestation services
(e.g., auditing or similar firm) appointed by the Issuer to review the Issuer’s performance with
respect to the Sustainability Performance Target(s).

8. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date,
with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date.

9. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1.0 million and (ii) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

10. “Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international
standing or an independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the
Issuer) as appointed by the Issuer at the expense of the Issuer, or, (b) if it is not reasonably
practicable to appoint a party as referred to under (a), the Issuer.

11. “Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page or screen so designated on Reuters (or such
other page or screen as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be
nominated as the information vendor).

12. “Sustainability Performance Target” means each of the following targets: (i) the Issuer’s target
to reduce the group’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions amount by 15% by the end of 2025 (from
the 2020 baseline of 0.495 tCO2e/ton), (ii) the Issuer’s target to increase the group’s proportion of
waste sent for recovery to 86.2% by the end of 2025 (from the 2020 baseline of 72.8%) and (iii) the
Issuer’s target to reduce the group’s waste water discharges per ton by 16.6% of net saleable
production by the end of 2025 (from the 2020 baseline of 11.06 m3/ton) (together the
“Sustainability Performance Targets”).

13. “TARGET Day” means any day on which the T2 is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

14. “T2” means the real time gross settlement system operated by the Eurosystem, or any successor
system.

15. “Testing Date” means December 31, 2025.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on each Determination

Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the notes in respect of
the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the
Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period,
multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All
percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred

235


-----

thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g.,
4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from
such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards). The
determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful
default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the notes be
higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not
be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the notes is permitted under any applicable law.

The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate in effect with respect to the notes in accordance with the

applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the notes to receive
the payments of interest on such notes will be subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to compliance with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain

_Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and_
_“—Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to issue additional notes, which shall have terms substantially_
identical to the notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered by the Issuer to the Trustee with a copy to the Paying Agent (“additional notes”):

(1) the title of such additional notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such additional notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such additional notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such additional notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate
or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which
such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record
dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon
which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such additional notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of additional notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such additional notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such additional notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
additional notes.

At the Issuer’s election, additional notes may be established in one or more supplemental indentures to the

Indenture in lieu of an Officer’s Certificate.

Such additional notes may, at our election, be treated, along with all other notes, as a single class for the

purposes of the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters
which are not specifically distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the
Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “notes” shall be deemed to include references to the notes
initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any additional notes. Additional notes may also be designated to be the

236


-----

same series as the notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all
material respects to such initial notes. However, in order for any additional notes to have the same ISIN, CUSIP or
Common Code, as applicable, as the notes initially issued on the Issue Date, such additional notes must be issued with
no more than de minimis original issue discount or be fungible with the initial notes for Italian income tax purposes
and U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Optional Redemption**

On and after, 2025, the Issuer may redeem the notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from

time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice sent electronically or mailed by first-class mail
to each holder’s registered address or provided otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, at par, plus Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but
excluding the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, at any time prior to, 2025, the Issuer may redeem the notes at its option, in whole at any

time or in part from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice sent electronically or
mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address or provided otherwise in accordance with the procedures
of Euroclear or Clearstream at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus
the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the notes

or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

At any time prior to, 2025, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice sent electronically

or mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address or provided otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, the Issuer may at its option from time to time redeem during each twelvemonth period commencing with the Issue Date up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes
(calculated after giving effect to any issuance of any additional notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the
principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any.

**_General_**

In connection with any redemption of notes (including with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the

amount of the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering, Incurrence of Indebtedness, Change of Control or other
transaction), any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including the completion of any related Equity Offering or other transaction. In addition, if such redemption or notice
is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed (without the need for a new redemption notice) until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by
the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed and/or that such notice
may be rescinded at any time by the Issuer if the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that any or all of such
conditions will not be satisfied (or waived). For the avoidance of doubt, if any redemption date shall be delayed as
contemplated by this paragraph and the terms of the applicable notice of redemption, such redemption date as so
delayed may occur, subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, at any time after the original
redemption date set forth in the applicable notice of redemption and after the satisfaction (or waiver) of any applicable
conditions precedent, including, without limitation, on a date that is less than 10 days after the original redemption
date or more than 60 days after the applicable notice of redemption. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice
that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may
be performed by another Person.

237


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the notes (including any Change of

Control Offer (as defined below)), if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such
a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the
Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice; provided
that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the notes that
remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the price
offered to each other holder in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

Subject to applicable federal and state securities laws, the Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from

time to time purchase notes or our other indebtedness. Any such purchases may be made through open market or
privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise,
upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer or any such affiliates may determine,
which may be more or less than the consideration for which the notes offered hereby are being sold.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the notes, it will, for so long as the notes are listed on the

Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption
and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such
redemption.

None of the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, or any of their respective agents

shall have any responsibility or liability for any actions taken or not taken by Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer (including any successor entity) under or with respect to the

notes or by or on behalf of the Guarantors under or with respect to any Guarantee will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes
is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction
or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the
Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated, established or resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having power to tax or (2) any jurisdiction from or through payment under
or with respect to on any such note or Guarantee is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax, by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor or the Paying Agent (each,
a “Tax Jurisdiction”), is required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or
with respect to the notes or by or on behalf of the Guarantors under or with respect to any Guarantee, including,
without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, if any, the Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will, subject to Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons, pay such additional
amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such
payments by each Holder of the notes after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the respective amounts that would have been received by each
Holder in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_ _however, that no_
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on the account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the existence of any actual or
deemed present or former connection between the Holder of the relevant notes (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the
relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability
company or corporation) or the beneficial owner of the relevant notes and the relevant Tax
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been resident for tax purposes in, or
being or having been a citizen, resident or national thereof or being or having been incorporated
therein, present or engaged in a trade or business or maintaining a permanent establishment therein
or having a place of management present or deemed present, or being physically present therein),
other than any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of any note or

238


-----

the enforcement or receipt of payment under or in respect of any Note, the Indenture or any
Guarantee; or

(2) any Taxes imposed or withheld as a result of the failure of a Holder or beneficial owner of the
relevant notes to comply with any written request, made to that Holder or the Holder on behalf of
that beneficial owner in writing at least 15 days before any such withholding or deduction would be
payable, by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors: (a) to provide timely or accurate information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, domicile, establishment, residence or
identity of such Holder or beneficial owner, or (b) to make any valid or timely declaration or similar
claim or satisfy any certification information or other reporting requirements, which, in each case
sub (a) and (b), is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of
the relevant Tax Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of
deduction or withholding of, such Taxes, but, in each case, only to the extent that the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such declaration, certification, documentation or other
information; or

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of any
note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is
first made available for payment to the Holder or beneficial owner of the notes (except to the extent
that such Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to Additional Amounts on account
of such Taxes had the note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period); or

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, capital gains, excise, wealth, net worth, personal property
or similar Tax, assessment or other governmental charge; or

(5) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of _imposta sostitutiva_ (pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time
(“Legislative Decree No. 239”) and any related implementing regulations, and pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Legislative Decree No. 461”)) and any related
implementing regulations) and any related implementing regulations; provided that:

(i) Additional Amounts shall be payable in circumstances where the procedures required
under Legislative Decree No. 239 or Legislative Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from
an exemption from _imposta sostitutiva_ have not been complied with due solely to the
actions or omissions of the payor or their agents; and

(ii) for the avoidance of doubt, no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to Taxes
to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva if the Holder becomes subject
to imposta sostitutiva after the Issue Date by reason of amendments to the list of countries
which allow for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, currently provided for
by Italian Ministerial Decree dated September 4, 1996, as subsequently amended, or by
reason of the approval of the ministerial Decree to be issued under Art. 11 par .4 let c) of
Legislative Decree No. 239, as subsequently amended or superseded, providing for a new
list of countries which allow for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, whereby
such Holders country of residence does not appear on the aforesaid amended or new list
(the “White List”); or

(6) any Taxes to the extent that such Taxes result from payment to a non-Italian resident legal entity or
a non-Italian resident individual which is an entity or individual resident in a country which does
not appear on the White List; or

(7) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment made under
or with respect to the notes or any Guarantee; or

239


-----

(8) any Tax imposed or withheld on or with respect to any payment if such holder of the notes is not
the beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that the beneficial owner of the payment would
not have been entitled to Additional Amounts with respect to such payment had such beneficial
owner been the holder of such note; or

(9) [Reserved]; or

(10) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any
official interpretations thereof, any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or official practices adopted
pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States
with respect to the foregoing sections of the Code or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section
1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(11) any combination of items (1) through (10) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will pay, and reimburse the Holder of the notes

for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes,
or similar charges or levies imposed by a Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of
any of the notes, the Indenture or any Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein or the receipt
of any payment with respect thereto ((i) other than in connection with a transfer of the notes after the Issue Date and
to the extent such Taxes are attributable to the receipt of any payments of principal or interest with respect to the notes,
and (ii) limited to any such Taxes that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6) and (8)
through (11) or any combination thereof in the immediately preceding paragraph of this section entitled “Additional
_Amounts”, as applicable), excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any registration, stamp duty, documentary or other_
similar tax, charge or levy arising from the execution of any formality made directly by, or on behalf of the holder and
not necessary to maintain, preserve, establish, or enforce the rights of such holder under the notes, any Guarantee, any
Security Document, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional

Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the notes or any Guarantee, the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent on a date at least 30 days prior to the
date of payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 45th day prior to that payment date,
in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall deliver such Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent promptly as practicable thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information
reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date. The Trustee
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely and without liability or further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate
as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor or any other applicable withholding tax agent will make all withholdings

and deductions in the minimum amount required by law to be made by them and will remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will
furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date that the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
is made, an Officer’s Certificate attaching copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as
the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence
of payments by such entity. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive evidence, without further
inquiry, of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the holders of the notes. Such copies or such other evidence of payment shall be made
available to the holders of the notes upon reasonable written request.

Whenever the Indenture, the notes or this “Description of the Notes” mentions the payment of amounts based

on the principal amount, interest or any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the notes or any
Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include, without duplication, the payment of Additional Amounts to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

240


-----

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by

a holder or beneficial owner of its notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor
Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated, organized, engaged in business or otherwise resident for
tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such person on the notes
(or any Guarantee) and any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On, 2029, the Issuer will redeem the notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and

cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any.

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less

than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the notes (which notice will be irrevocable and distributed
to Holders in the same manner as described in “—Optional Redemption”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed by the
Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and that will become
due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the notes
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is prior to the Tax Redemption Date
and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in
respect of the notes or any Guarantee, the Issuer or any Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts
(but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount payable cannot be paid by the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it, including the
appointment of a different paying agent (provided that changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer or Guarantor is not a
reasonable measure for purposes of this section), as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols, official guidance
or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Tax Jurisdiction affecting taxation which change or
amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum
(or, if the relevant Tax Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the date on which such Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction under the
Indenture); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official
position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations, official guidance, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice), which change, amendment, application
or interpretation is announced and becomes effective on or after the date of this Offering
Memorandum (or, if the relevant Tax Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the date of this
Offering Memorandum, the date on which such Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction under
the Indenture) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”).

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which

the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect
of the notes or Guarantees were then due, and unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, sending of any notice of redemption of the notes pursuant to the

foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that there has been such Change in Tax
Law which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or sends
notice of redemption of the notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect

241


-----

that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor taking
reasonable measures available to it.

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence, without

liability or further inquiry, of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which
event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders of the notes.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in

which any successor to the Issuer or a Guarantor (as appropriate) is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident
for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions
will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer will not be required to make any other mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with

respect to the notes.

**Selection and Notice**

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the notes for redemption will be made by the Paying Agent

or the Registrar in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable; provided that no such
selection shall result in a holder of notes with a principal amount of notes less than the minimum denomination for
the notes as set forth in “—Issuance, Transfer and Exchange.” If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
of redemption relating to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note
in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on notes or portions
thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuer has deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the
principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest (if any) on, the notes to be redeemed. None of the Trustee, the Transfer
Agent, Paying Agent or the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

So long as any notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for

trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the
holders of the relevant notes shall to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules be posted on the official
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

**Guarantees**

On or about the Issue Date the notes will not be guaranteed. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor

Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles (including, among others, limitations arising due to corporate benefit
rules) (i) no later than 60 days after the Issue Date, the following subsidiaries of the Issuer: Fineska B.V., Eska B.V.,
Eska International B.V., Eska USA B.V. and R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH and (ii) from time to time, each of the Issuer’s
other Restricted Subsidiaries that becomes a Borrower or a Guarantor (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) under
the Credit Agreement, in each case, are expected to, subject to the limitations described under “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,” provide a guarantee in relation_
to the notes or to the benefit of holders of the notes on a senior secured basis for the performance and punctual payment
when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture
and the notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the notes, expenses, indemnification
or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors being herein called the “Guaranteed Obligations”).

Each Guarantee will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and contractually limited as it relates to its

Guarantor, to reflect limitations under the Agreed Security Principles and applicable law with respect to, among other
things, maintenance of share capital, legal or corporate benefit, thin capitalization, tax issues, fraudulent conveyance,
financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to such Guarantor and its shareholders, directors and general
partners which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by each relevant Guarantor. See

242


-----

“—Security; the Collateral.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the notes or could even be equal to or reduced to zero. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral,” “Risk Factors—The Issuer, and RdM
_are incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as insolvency_
_laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Each Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders of the notes and their
successors, transferees and assigns.

A Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) the sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor if after
such sale, disposition or other transfer, such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or the
sale, disposition or other transfer of all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor, in each case
if such sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer is made in a manner not in violation of the
Indenture;

(b) (i) the Issuer designating such Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or (ii) such Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary in
accordance with the definition of “Excluded Subsidiary” (unless such subsidiary continues to
provide a guarantee under the Credit Agreement);

(c) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor under the Credit Agreement;

(d) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that is required to guarantee the notes pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” the release or discharge of
any Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the notes, provided that no
other Indebtedness is at the time guaranteed by the Guarantor that would result in the requirement
that the Guarantor provide a Guarantee pursuant to the same covenant;

(e) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance,” or if the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, including as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(f) the merger or consolidation of such Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is
the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or upon the liquidation or dissolution of such
Guarantor following the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to the Issuer or another
Guarantor;

(g) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;”

(h) as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(i) pursuant to or as contemplated by “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”
or “—Certain Covenants—IPO Pushdown;”

243


-----

(j) upon the release or discharge of all other Guarantees by such Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Issuer
or any other Guarantor;

(k) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture
and the notes; or

(l) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that following a Reversion Date, if any,
each Guarantor shall be reinstated to the extent and within the timeframe required under “—Certain
_Covenants—Future Guarantors.”_

Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary, including trade creditors, and

claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary, generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of such Subsidiary over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including the holders of the notes. The notes,
therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors)
and preferred stockholders (if any) of any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above and upon request of the Issuer, the Security

Agent and, to the extent reasonably requested, the Trustee shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any
release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions and will, at the cost and expense of the Issuer, execute any
documents reasonably required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Guarantee, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected without the consent of the holders of the notes or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.
Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the notes to reflect any such release,
termination or discharge.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events after the Issue Date (each, a “Change of Control”), each

holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof (the “Change of Control Payment”), plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), except to the extent the Issuer has previously or
concurrently elected to redeem the notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”:

(1) the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all the
assets (other than Capital Stock, debt or other securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to a Person other than any of the Permitted Holders, a
Restricted Subsidiary or an IPO Entity, provided that a Change of Control under this clause (1) shall
not be deemed to have occurred if such Change of Control is also a Specified Change of Control
Event; or

(2) the Issuer becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) of the acquisition by any Person or group
(within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, or any successor
provision), including any group acting for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of
securities (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), other than any of the
Permitted Holders, in a single transaction or in a related series of transactions, by way of merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination or purchase of beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), of more
than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer, or any direct or indirect parent
of the Issuer that holds directly or indirectly an amount of Voting Stock of the Issuer such that the
Issuer is a Subsidiary of such holding company unless the Permitted Holders have, at such time, the
right or the ability by voting power, contract or otherwise to elect or designate at least a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer (provided that, for purposes of this
determination, to the extent any Person or group includes both Permitted Holders and non-Permitted

244


-----

Holders (any such Person or group, the “Subject Group”), and the Subject Group does not itself
constitute a Permitted Holder, then the Voting Stock of the Issuer directly or indirectly beneficially
owned by such Permitted Holders in such Subject Group shall not be treated as being beneficially
owned by such Subject Group), provided, further, that (i) no Change of Control shall be deemed to
occur by reason of the Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of an IPO Entity and (ii) a Change of Control
shall not be deemed to have occurred if such Change of Control is also a Specified Change of Control
Event; or

(3) TopCo (or New Holdco in a transaction constituting a Permitted Parent Reorganization) ceases to
directly own the percentage of the total issued share capital of the Issuer owned on the Issue Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) the transfer of assets between or among the Issuer and its Restricted

Subsidiaries shall not itself constitute a Change of Control, (B) a Person or group shall not be deemed to have
beneficial ownership of securities subject to a stock purchase agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (or
voting or option agreement related thereto) prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such
agreement and (C) the right to acquire Voting Stock (so long as such Person does not have the right to direct the voting
of the Voting Stock subject to such right) or any veto power in connection with the acquisition or disposition of Voting
Stock will not cause a party to be a beneficial owner.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction in which the Issuer or a parent entity of the Issuer

becomes a subsidiary of another Person (such Person, the “New Parent”) shall not constitute a Change of Control if
(a) the equityholders of the Issuer or such parent entity immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own, directly
or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, at least a majority of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of
the Issuer or such New Parent immediately following the consummation of such transaction, substantially in
proportion to their holdings of the equity of the Issuer or such parent entity prior to such transaction or (b) immediately
following the consummation of such transaction, no Person, other than a Permitted Holder, the New Parent or any
subsidiary of the New Parent, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, more than
50% of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer or the New Parent.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right

to redeem the notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer shall send electronically, mail by firstclass mail or otherwise provide in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, a notice
(a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder with a copy to the Trustee describing:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to
purchase such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of purchase (subject to
the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment
date);

(2) the transaction or transactions constitute a Change of Control;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is sent, except that if a Change of Control Offer is made in advance of a Change of Control
and conditioned upon such Change of Control as stated below, the expected repurchase date will be
stated and may be based on a date relative to the closing of the transaction that is expected to result
in the Change of Control and may be tolled until the closing of such transaction) (the “Change of
**Control Payment Date”) and the record date; and**

(4) the instructions determined by the Issuer that a holder must follow in order to have its notes
purchased.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the

extent lawful:

245


-----

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
notes so tendered plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and
unpaid interest if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes
in order to reflect thereon the portion of such notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to
and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

Holders electing to have any notes purchased shall be required to surrender the notes, with an appropriate

form duly completed, to the Issuer at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the
purchase date. The holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Issuer receives not later than two Business
Days prior to the purchase date a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder, the principal
amount of the notes which was delivered for purchase by the holder and a statement that such holder is withdrawing
his election to have such notes purchased. Holders whose notes are purchased only in part shall be issued new notes
equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third

party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant
to the Indenture as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment
of the applicable redemption price.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such

Change of Control, with a purchase date to occur upon, or within a specified period of time not to exceed 15 days
after, the consummation of such Change of Control.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14(e)-1 of the Exchange Act

and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of such covenant, the Issuer
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance.

Debt agreements to which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a party may prohibit the Issuer

from purchasing any notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when
the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing any notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the
purchase of such notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does
not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such
case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The Credit Agreement will, and future credit agreements or other debt agreements to which the Issuer or a

Restricted Subsidiary becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer
would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change
of control that triggers a default under our Credit Agreement or such other Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of
such defaults or seek to refinance our Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such

246


-----

a waiver or refinance the Credit Agreement and such other Indebtedness, such defaults could result in amounts
outstanding under our Credit Agreement and such other Indebtedness being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the holders of notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited

by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—Future liquidity and cash flow
_difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do_
_so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision that_
_will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate_
_events, including an event deemed not to be a change of control when, at the time of such event, our consolidated net_
_leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels.”_

The Change of Control purchase feature of the notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or

discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase
feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a
transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject
to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions,
refinancings, securitizations or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital
structure or credit ratings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—Future liquidity and cash flow
_difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do_
_so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision that_
_will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate_
_events, including an event deemed not to be a change of control when, at the time of such event, our consolidated net_
_leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the

Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control with respect to the notes has occurred and whether a holder of the notes may require the Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes

as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the notes.

If and for so long as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted

for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will
publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control
Payment Date in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger
_Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the_
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status._**

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two Rating Agencies

and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the Issuer and its

247


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants or provisions (collectively, the “Suspended
**Covenants”):**

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
_Stock;”_

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries;”

(4) “—Asset Sales;”

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(6) “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets;” and

(7) “—Future Guarantors;”

(8) “—Impairment of Security Interest;” and

(9) the second paragraph of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under

the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”)
one or both of the relevant Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned
to the notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be
subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events.

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is

referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant
Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Cash Proceeds shall be reset at zero. In the event of any
such reinstatement on a Reversion Date, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries prior to such Reversion Date (and no action taken or omitted to be taken following a Reversion Date in
connection with honoring, complying with or otherwise performing or consummating any contractual commitments
or obligations entered into during a Suspension Period) will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the
Indenture with respect to the notes; _provided_ that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made after any such
reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under the
caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period
(accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made
as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) and (2) all Indebtedness
Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been
Incurred or issued pursuant to clause (c) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”_

In addition, for purposes of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements

and arrangements entered into by the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with an Affiliate of the Issuer during
the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered into on or prior to the Issue
Date, and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
_Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any_
of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been existing on the Issue Date.

The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant

Suspension Event or Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if
such events have occurred, (ii) make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension

248


-----

Period on the Issuer’s and its Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the holders of the
notes of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock._**

The Indenture will provide that:

(1) the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock;
and

(2) the Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor) to
issue any shares of Preferred Stock,

_provided, however, that the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired_
Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries may issue shares
of Preferred Stock (any such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock Incurred or issued pursuant to this proviso, the “Ratio
**Debt”), in each case if (a) other than in the case of Senior Secured Debt, either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio**
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Applicable Test Date would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 or (y)
the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Applicable Test Date would
have been no greater than 4.7 to 1.00 or (b) in the case of Senior Secured Debt, the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt
Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Applicable Test Date would have been no greater than 3.8
to 1.00, in each case, determined on a _pro forma_ basis (including a _pro forma_ application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been Incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been
issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred, at the beginning of such fourquarter period.

100% of EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date; provided, that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant
to this clause (a) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing does not exceed the greater of
(I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause
(a) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being
refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and
fees, underwriting discounts and other fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance
costs, associated with such refinancing);

(ff) Letters of credit, guarantees, performance bonds or other similar instruments or obligations issued
or relating to liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental
requirement (including in connection with the requirements of concessions, licenses or other
approvals from governmental authorities).

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness,

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred as Ratio Debt, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, as of the Applicable
Test Date, divide and/or classify, or at any later time re-divide and/or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant. With
respect to clauses (d)(1), (k), (r)(ii), (s)(i), (x), (dd) and (ee) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness as
Ratio Debt, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into
an item of Indebtedness Incurred as Ratio Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Indebtedness Incurred or deemed
Incurred under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant
to clause (a) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any
portion of such Indebtedness. The Issuer will also be entitled to divide, classify or reclassify an item of Indebtedness
in more than one of the types permitted in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant without giving pro forma
effect to the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) Incurred pursuant to the
second paragraph of this covenant when calculating the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
(or any portion thereof) that may be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a

Debt Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid (including the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue
Date), shall, at the option of the Issuer, only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the
date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. Accrual of
interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount or deferred financing costs, the
payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the
same class, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as
a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, the outstanding
principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once and guarantees of, or obligations in respect
of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of
Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence

254


-----

of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this
covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of

Indebtedness, the euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent), in the case of
revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded
if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the outstanding, in the case of term debt, or, if greater, committed principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer

and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect
to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in
which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing.

**_Financial Calculations. When calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in_**

connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination shall be the Applicable Test Date and such
Applicable Metric shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Applicable Transaction as if it
occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate
any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance
of doubt, (x) if any such Applicable Metric is exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (including
due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at
or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted
hereunder and (y) such Applicable Metric shall not be retested at the time of consummation of such transaction or
related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur on any date prior to
consummation of the relevant Applicable Transaction, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness (and the use of proceeds thereof) and Liens) shall be deemed to have occurred on such date and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any Applicable Metric under the Indenture after such date and before
the consummation of such transaction.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro
denominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro
transaction is made. No Default or breach under the Indenture shall arise merely as a result of any subsequent change
in currency exchange rates.

In respect of any four full fiscal quarter period, exchange rates used in relation to an item of Consolidated

Total Indebtedness may be, at the election of Issuer, (i) the weighted average exchange rates for that period, (ii) the
exchange rate used in the relevant financial statements as of the last day of such period, (iii) the exchange rate as in
effect on the date that Indebtedness was incurred or (iv) the exchange rate on the Issue Date; provided that, where
applicable and at the election of the Issuer, any amount of Indebtedness will be stated so as to take into account the
hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in respect of or by reference to that Indebtedness.

Any Applicable Metric where an element is set by reference to a percentage of EBITDA shall be tested by

reference to the applicable level of EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (unless otherwise specified)
for the relevant 12-month period preceding the Applicable Reporting Date prior to the Applicable Transaction Date.
Accordingly, any amounts incurred on the basis of such EBITDA-based basket shall (provided that such amounts are,
at the time of incurrence, duly and properly incurred in accordance with the relevant basket, test or permission) be
treated as having been duly and properly incurred without the incurrence of an Event of Default even in the event that

255


-----

such EBITDA-based basket subsequently decreases by virtue of operation of that calculation. If (x) any restriction,
basket, threshold or permission is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “fixed component”)
and a percentage of EBITDA (the “grower component”) and (y) the grower component of the applicable restriction,
basket, threshold or permission exceeds the applicable fixed component at any time, the fixed component shall be
deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower component reached from time to time and shall not
subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower component.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period or

any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during
such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive)
between the permitted amount in the preceding Annual Periods and the amount thereof actually used
or applied by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries during such preceding Annual Periods (the
“Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the
following Annual Periods and the permitted amount in such following Annual Periods shall be
reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”) _provided that,_ for the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent such Applicable Metric provides an alternative method of
increasing the amount permitted by that Applicable Metric by applying unused capacity from prior
periods or capacity from future periods (an “Alternative Carry Forward/Back Provision”), the
Issuer may choose to apply either the provisions of this clause (i) or the applicable Alternative Carry
Forward/Back Provision when calculating the Applicable Metric but Alternative Carry
Forward/Back Provision may not be combined with the provisions of this clause (i); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against
the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such
Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the
Carry Back Amount.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit_**

any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

securities);

proviso to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of

(23) dividends, loans, distributions, advances or other payments by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to or on behalf of any Parent to service the payment of principal amounts, interest
amounts and premiums, discounts, catch-up payments, make-whole amounts, fees, costs, expenses,
hedging, tax, break costs and indemnification obligations under or in respect of any Indebtedness
the Net Cash Proceeds of which have been contributed or loaned to the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries; and

(24) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount, when taken together with all other Restricted
Payments made pursuant to this clause (24) that are at that time outstanding, not to exceed the
aggregate amount of Declined Excess Proceeds plus Available Proceeds,

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted under clauses_
(6)(b), (7), (8), (10), (21) and (22), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would
occur as a consequence thereof.

The Issuer will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to

the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid prior
to the time of designation) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted
Investments in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such
designation will only be permitted if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted
at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

For purposes of the covenant described above, if any Investment or Restricted Payment would be permitted

pursuant to one or more provisions described above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to clauses
(c)(1) to (c)(7) of the first paragraph of this covenant) and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition
of “Permitted Investments,” the Issuer may divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment in any manner
that complies with this covenant and may later divide and reclassify any such Investment or Restricted Payment so
long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so divided and/or reclassified) would be permitted to be made in
reliance on the applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification. In the event that a Restricted Payment (or
any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) is divided, classified or reclassified under clause
(22) above or clause (31) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” (such clauses, the “Incurrence Clauses”), the
determination of the amount of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment that may be made pursuant to the
Incurrence Clauses shall be made without giving _pro forma_ effect to any substantially concurrent Incurrence of
Indebtedness to finance any other Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion
thereof) divided, classified or reclassified under any of the above clauses or the definitions thereof other than an
Incurrence Clause.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as

permitted by the Indenture to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent
Entity or any Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and
to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action
by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer_**

will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create
or otherwise cause to become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to:

(a) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
(1) on its Capital Stock or (2) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by,
its profits; or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(b) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,

except in each case for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect or entered into or existing on the Issue Date,
including pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Hedging Obligations and the other documents relating
to the Transactions;

(2) the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents, the
Indenture, the notes, any additional notes permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture, and in each
case any exchange notes and guarantees thereof;

(3) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation, order or the terms of any license, authorization,
concession or permit, or required by any regulatory authority;

264


-----

(4) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
which was in existence at the time of such acquisition or at the time it merges with or into the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary or assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from such
Person (but not created in contemplation thereof or to provide all or any portion of the funds or
credit support utilized to consummate such acquisition other than in connection with the Incurrence
of Indebtedness of the type contemplated by clause (d) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock and Preferred Stock”), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or_
the properties or assets of any Person and its Subsidiaries, other than the Person, or the property or
assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired or the property or assets so assumed;

(5) contracts or agreements for the sale of assets, including customary restrictions with respect to a
Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of
all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) Indebtedness secured by a Lien that is otherwise permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenants
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
_and Preferred Stock” and “—Limitation on Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the_
assets securing such Indebtedness;

(7) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by banks, suppliers, customers or
landlords under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice or industry norm or arising in connection with any Permitted Liens;

(8) customary provisions in joint venture, operating or other similar agreements, asset sale agreements
and stock sale agreements in connection with the entering into of such transaction;

(9) purchase money obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations and other capital or finance lease
obligations in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the nature described in
clause (c) above;

(10) customary provisions contained in leases, licenses, contracts and other similar agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norm (including
leases or licenses of intellectual property) that impose restrictions of the type described in clause (c)
above on the property subject to such lease, license, contract or agreement;

(11) any encumbrances or restrictions contained in any Permitted Securitization Document with respect
to any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary or any Standard Securitization Undertakings;

(12) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of (a) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a Guarantor or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not
a Guarantor, in each case that is Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
_and Preferred Stock;” provided_ that, in the case of clause (b), either (i) such encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument will not materially adversely affect the Issuer’s
ability to make anticipated principal or interest payment on the notes (as determined by the Issuer
in good faith), (ii) such encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more restrictive, taken as
a whole, than those contained in the Transaction Documents or the Indenture (with respect to other
indentures) or the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date (with respect to other credit
agreements), (iii) such encumbrance or restrictions are customary for transactions of the type of
such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or (iv) such encumbrances and restrictions
apply only during the continuance of a default or event of default covenant relating to such
Indebtedness;

265


-----

(13) any Restricted Investment not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” and any Permitted Investment;_

(14) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do
not, individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of property or assets of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary thereof in any manner material to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
thereof;

(15) existing under, by reason of or with respect to Refinancing Indebtedness; _provided_ that the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the agreements governing that Refinancing Indebtedness
are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements
governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(16) restrictions or conditions contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply,
purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party
entered into in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ that such agreement prohibits the
encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the
subject of such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does
not extend to any other asset or property of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or
property of any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(17) in the case of clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant, any encumbrance or restriction that
restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that
is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any such lease,
license (including without limitations, licenses of intellectual property) or other contracts; and

(18) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above imposed or
effected by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in
clauses (1) through (17) above or any new arrangements on substantially similar terms; _provided_
that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings or new arrangements are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not
materially more restrictive as a whole with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions
than those contained in the dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment,
modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving

dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock shall
not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or
advances made to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any such
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Asset Sales. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted_**

Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives or will receive
consideration (measured as of the Applicable Test Date) at least equal to the Fair Market Value of
the Equity Interests issued or assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of (x) a Permitted Asset Swap and (y) any Asset Sale, or series of related Asset
Sales, with a purchase price not exceeding the greater of (i) €40 million and (ii) 25 % of EBITDA
as of the Applicable Test Date, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with
all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the
amount of:

266


-----

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance
sheet or in the notes thereto or, if Incurred, increased or decreased subsequent to the date
of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected in the Issuer’s or such
Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the notes thereto if such Incurrence, increase or
decrease had taken place on the date of such balance sheet, as reasonably determined in
good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities
that are by their terms subordinated to the notes) that are assumed by the transferee (or a
third party on behalf of the transferee) of any such assets or Equity Interests or that are
otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction with such transferee;

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days of the receipt thereof
(to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received);

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with
all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at
that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) €40 million and (y) 25% of EBITDA
as of the Applicable Test Date (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value);

(d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection
with such Asset Sale; and

(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary received
from Persons who are not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision.

Within 18 months after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of any

Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from such
Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) to repay, redeem, repurchase, discharge or defease Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto);

(2) to repay, redeem, repurchase, discharge or defease Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto), _provided_ that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall so
reduce such Indebtedness, the Issuer or such Guarantor will equally and ratably reduce Obligations
under the notes (A) through open-market purchases, (B) by redeeming notes if the notes are then
redeemable as provided under “—Optional Redemption” or (C) by making an offer (in accordance
with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders of the notes;

(3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the
form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such Person is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer), New Projects, assets, property or capital expenditures in each case used
or useful in a Similar Business, or to make acquisitions or investments not prohibited by the
indenture or to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the date on which the
Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Cash Proceeds was contractually committed;

267


-----

(4) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the
form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such Person is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer), properties or assets that replace the properties and assets that are the
subject of such Asset Sale or to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the
date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Cash Proceeds was contractually committed;

(5) to repay, redeem, repurchase, discharge or defease Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is
not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute
Collateral (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto), other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the provisions described_
in clauses (3) and (4) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 18 months after the Asset Sale that generated
the Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary has entered into and not abandoned or rejected
a binding agreement to acquire the assets or Capital Stock of a Similar Business, make an investment or make a capital
expenditure in compliance with the provision described in clauses (3) and (4) of this paragraph (an “Acceptable
**Agreement”) with the good faith expectation that such acquisition, purchase or capital expenditure will be completed**
within six months after the end of such 18-month period; provided, further, that if any Acceptable Agreement is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason after the end of such 18-month period and before an amount equal to such Net
Cash Proceeds is applied, then such unapplied amount shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below) unless the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding agreement (a “Second Acceptable Agreement”)
within six months of such cancellation or termination of the prior binding agreement; provided, further, that the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary may only enter into a Second Acceptable Agreement under the foregoing provision one
time with respect to each Asset Sale and to the extent such Second Acceptable Agreement is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds is applied or is not applied within six
months of such Second Acceptable Agreement, then such unapplied amount shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any amount, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce

Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise use such amount in any manner not prohibited by
the Indenture. Any amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale that is not applied as provided and
within the time period set forth in the two preceding paragraphs (it being understood that any portion of such Net Cash
Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase notes, as described in clause (2) above, shall be deemed to have been
invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.”

When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) €40 million and (y) 25% of

EBITDA of the Applicable Test Date (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer to all holders
of notes, and, at the option of the Issuer, to the holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor
(an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that
may be purchased out of the Applicable Percentage of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event such Pari Passu Indebtedness was issued with significant
original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, such lesser price, if any, as may be offered to the holders of such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness), to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture or agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the
notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will
commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to the Applicable Percentage of Excess Proceeds within ten (10) Business
Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceeds the Excess Proceeds Threshold by mailing or electronically sending
or otherwise providing in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, the notice
required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may, at its option, satisfy the
foregoing obligations with respect to an amount equal to or less than the amount of any Net Cash Proceeds from an
Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 18 months (or such longer period as
provided above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds below the Excess Proceeds Threshold. To the extent that the
aggregate amount of notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor tendered pursuant to an

268


-----

Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount of Excess Proceeds with respect to which an Asset Sale Offer has been made,
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use such remaining Excess Proceeds (the “Declined Excess Proceeds”)
for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes or the Pari Passu
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds
subject to the Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer shall select or cause to be selected the notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness
in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall
be reset to zero.

If the aggregate principal amount of notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor

surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds subject to the Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer shall
select or cause to be selected the notes in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities
exchange, if any, on which such notes are listed (and the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if such
notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable, by lot or by such other method as the Issuer deems
appropriate. Selection of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that ranks equally in right
of payment with the notes or the relevant Guarantee will be made pursuant to the terms of such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness.

The procedures for an Asset Sale Offer will be substantially the same as for a Change of Control Offer. The

Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and
regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes pursuant
to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Future credit agreements to which the Company becomes a party may limit or prohibit the Company from

purchasing any notes as a result of an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Company is required to make an Asset Sale
Offer at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing the notes, the Company could seek the consent of
its lenders to permit the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain
prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute
an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be

waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

**_Transactions with Affiliates. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of_**

its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose
of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any
transaction or series of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the
benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
consideration in excess of the greater of (x) €16 million and (y) 10% of EBITDA of the Applicable Test Date, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable, when taken as a whole,
to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of (x) €40 million and (y) 25% of EBITDA as of
the Applicable Test Date, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a resolution adopted in good faith by the
majority of the Board of Directors approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate provided to the Trustee certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause
(a) above.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (b) of this

paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

269

meets the requirements of clause (a) of the preceding paragraph;

of business;

(7) any agreement, instrument or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date (including by or in respect

a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date as determined by the
Issuer in good faith);

(8) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its

Memorandum and, in each case, any amendment thereto or similar transactions, agreements or
arrangements which it (or any Parent) may enter into thereafter; _provided,_ _however, that the_
existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under, any future amendment to any such existing transaction, agreement or arrangement or under
any similar transaction, agreement or arrangement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be
permitted by this clause (8) to the extent that the terms of any such existing transaction, agreement
or arrangement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new transaction,
agreement or arrangement are not otherwise materially adverse to the holders of the notes when
taken as a whole as compared to the original transaction, agreement or arrangement as in effect on
the Issue Date or described in this Offering Memorandum, as determined in good faith by the Issuer;

**_Liens._** The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted

Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or Incur any Lien that secures obligations under any Indebtedness on any
asset or property of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, except: (x) in the case of any asset or property that
constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens and (y) in the case of any asset or property that does not constitute
Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens or (ii) Liens other than Permitted Liens; provided that with respect to clause (y)(ii) that
(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the notes or the applicable Guarantee of a Guarantor, as
the case may be, are secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by a Lien on such property or assets that is
senior in priority to such Liens; and (2) in all other cases, the notes or the applicable Guarantee of a Guarantor, as the
case may be, are equally and ratably secured.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lien securing the notes granted pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall

be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness
described above of their Lien on the property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed
release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness (except upon foreclosure or default of such
Indebtedness)), (b) any sale, exchange or transfer to any Person other than the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of
the property or assets secured by such Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such Lien in each case in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, (c) payment in full of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes,
(d) a defeasance or discharge of the notes in accordance with the procedures described below under “—Defeasance”
or “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or (e) in connection with an IPO Pushdown as specified in the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien (or any portion thereof) need not be

permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition
of “Permitted Liens” or “Permitted Collateral Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be
permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien (or any portion thereof) meets the
criteria of one or more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of
“Permitted Liens” or “Permitted Collateral Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer may,
in its sole discretion, divide, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if Incurred at such later
time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant, and as of the Applicable Test Date will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such
item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of permitted Liens (or any
portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or “Permitted Collateral Liens” or pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant and, in such event, such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) will be treated as being Incurred or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof)
or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof without giving pro forma effect to such item (or any portion thereof) when
calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) that may be Incurred pursuant to any other
clause or paragraph (or any portion thereof) at such time.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of

the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms or in the form of
common stock, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock of the
same class, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, any fees, underwriting discounts, accrued
and unpaid interest, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith and increases in the
amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in
the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Reports and Other Information._**

For so long as any notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Reporting Entity’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2023, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following
information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Reporting Entity as of the end of the two
most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of
the Reporting Entity for the two most recent fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such
financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b)
unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the Reporting
Entity (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement
or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available, together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the
most recently completed fiscal year to which such annual report relates, unless such _pro forma_
information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (2) or (3) below (provided
that such _pro forma_ financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense, and, in the case of a material acquisition, the Reporting Entity may instead
provide acquired company financials to the extent reasonably available without unreasonable
expense or burden); (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements,
including a discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial condition and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Reporting Entity; (d) a brief description of the
business, management and shareholders of the Reporting Entity, material affiliate transactions and
material debt instruments (unless such contractual arrangements were described in a previous annual
or quarterly report, in which case the Reporting Entity need describe only any material changes);
and (e) a description of material operational risk factors and material recent developments (provided
that the information described in clauses (d) and (e) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited
consolidated financial statements);

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Reporting Entity, beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2024, all quarterly reports of the
Reporting Entity containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash
flow for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance
sheet date, and the comparable prior year period for the Reporting Entity, together with condensed
footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited _pro forma_ income statement information and balance sheet
information of the Reporting Entity (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the
provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together
with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly
report relates (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent
available without unreasonable expense or burden, and in the case of a material acquisition, the
Reporting Entity may instead provide acquired company financials to the extent reasonably
available without unreasonable expense); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any acquisition, disposition or restructuring that is material to the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of the chief executive officer,
executive chairman or chief financial officer at the Reporting Entity or change in auditors of the
Reporting Entity or any other material event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event;

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to (i) contain any_
reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or IFRS or (ii) include separate financial statements
for Guarantors or non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Reporting Entity or include financial statements for any period
other than the Reporting Entity’s fiscal year or fiscal quarter.

274


-----

All financial statements and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in

effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above
may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods.
Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity, the requirements
of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the Issuer or the IPO Entity complies with
the reporting requirements of such stock exchange where the shares of the IPO Entity are listed.

Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of

the Issuer. At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1) and (2) of

the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies
of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer or the Reporting Entity or (ii) otherwise to
provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the
extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the
preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such
reports to the holders of the notes and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the notes. The Issuer will also make
available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long
as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro
MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, to the extent and in the manner permitted
by such rules, by posting such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

In addition, so long as the notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Reporting Entity

is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer
shall furnish to the holders of the notes and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the notes, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Issuer will also hold quarterly conference calls, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31,

2024, for all holders of the notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the
notes and securities analysts to discuss such financial information and, prior to the date of each such conference call,
will announce the time and date of such conference call and either include all information necessary to access the call
or inform holders of the notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser of the notes
and securities analysts how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the applicable password
or login information (if applicable).

The Issuer may satisfy its obligations and the requirements of this covenant with respect to financial

information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to any Parent (any such entity that
provides such financial statements, information or other documents from time to time, the “Reporting Entity”)
consolidating reporting at its level in a manner consistent with that described in this covenant; _provided_ that such
financial information is accompanied by consolidating information or some other form of reconciliation that explains
in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Reporting Entity and its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports and Other Information” covenant shall be made in the

English language.

**_Future Guarantors._** The Indenture will provide that, to the extent legally possible and subject to the

Intercreditor Agreement and to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer will cause each Restricted Subsidiary (other
than any Excluded Subsidiary) that is a Borrower or a Guarantor (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in respect of

275


-----

any Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Agreement, to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which such Subsidiary will become a Guarantor under the Indenture within twenty (20) Business Days of
the date that such guarantee has been granted pursuant to any Credit Agreement.

Each Guarantee will be contractually limited as it relates to such Guarantor, to reflect limitations under the

Agreed Security Principles and applicable law (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations
or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally). See “—Guarantees” and “—Security; the Collateral.” By
virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the notes or could even be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Each Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—

_Guarantees.”_

**_IPO Pushdown_**

(a) At the option of the Issuer, on, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Issuer shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the
relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis that (unless otherwise set out in
the Pushdown Notice):

(i) references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply
only
to the IPO Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time (or the Issuer, Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, if so elected), although, save as otherwise
permitted by the Indenture, the Issuer shall remain the same entity;

(ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations, financial definitions and financial ratio calculations
shall exclude any holding company of the IPO Entity and any Person who is not a
Subsidiary of the IPO Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of
the IPO Entity (or as otherwise permitted by the Indenture);

(iii) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to a holding company of the Issuer or a holding company of the
IPO Entity and any Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO Entity performing a particular
role or acting in a particular capacity shall (unless specified otherwise in the Pushdown
Notice) be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Entity (to the extent applicable and unless
the context requires otherwise) and provided that nothing in this paragraph (a), including
the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action taken by the
IPO Entity prior to such designation, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default
or an Event of Default;

(iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants, Defaults or Events of
Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or the Security Documents or otherwise shall apply to any Person of which the
IPO Entity is Subsidiary or any Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO Entity (whether
in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) (or to the IPO Entity, if so elected);

(v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity or any
Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or
otherwise) (or to the IPO Entity, if so elected) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or

276


-----

indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or
a Default or an Event of Default;

(vi) each holding company of the IPO Entity and any Person who is not a Subsidiary of the IPO
Entity, shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under and in
connection with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and any security granted by it or any holding company of it; and

(vii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement and which is a holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement and all obligations and
restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Issuer
that person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement and shall have no further
rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement); and (B) there shall be no
obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and (C) any term of the Indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or any other agreement which requires or assumes that any
person be a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or that any liabilities or obligations be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this provision).

(b) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture
or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or the Security Documents or any other agreement or instrument reasonably required
by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is reasonably required by the Issuer in order to facilitate
or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above, provided that such amendment,
replacement or other document or instrument does not impose any obligations on the Trustee or the
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Security Agent, does not
affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Security Agent under such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are
each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the holders of the notes (without any consent by the
holders of the notes) to execute any such amendment or replacement documents and/or take such
other action on behalf of the holders of the notes (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost
of the Issuer), subject to the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction.

(c) For the purpose of this covenant and the Indenture, the “IPO Entity” shall be the Issuer (or any
Affiliate), any Parent, any Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary (or any successor of any such
Person) as notified to the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO
Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event, provided that (i) the IPO Entity shall be an entity which
will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a holding company
thereof) and (ii) a Subsidiary of the Issuer may not be designated as the IPO Entity unless the Issuer
is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of such IPO Entity.

(d) If a Pushdown Notice is delivered to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) above in relation to a
contemplated IPO Event, the Person who delivered that Pushdown Notice shall be entitled to revoke
that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice
to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph
(d): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)(i) to (a)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that
Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance
on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer or the relevant

277


-----

Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security
Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any person party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Shareholder Creditor” has been released from the
Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown
Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior written notice to the Issuer and that Person, that Person
shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as a Shareholder Creditor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (d) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer

from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation
of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of
any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any other
document or instrument or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any
person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether

or not it is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of its properties or assets (other than Capital Stock, debt or other securities of any Unrestricted Subsidiary but
otherwise determined on a consolidated basis), in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) either (a) the Issuer is the surviving Person or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger or winding up (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership,
limited liability company or similar entity organized or existing under the laws of any member state
of the European Union, the United Kingdom, any British Crown Dependency or the United States
of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada or Switzerland (each a “Permitted Jurisdiction”) (the Issuer or such Person, as the case
may be, being herein called the “Successor Company” for the purposes of this paragraph);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer
under the Indenture and the notes, pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or
instruments;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at
the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness as Ratio Debt; or

(b) either (I) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be less than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
immediately prior to such transaction or (II) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the
Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than such ratio
for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) stating that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture.

278


-----

The Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer under the

Indenture and the notes and in such event the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations
under the Indenture and the notes and, to the extent the transaction constitutes a Permitted Combination, the pledge
over the shares of the Issuer may be released.

Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4) above, (a) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may

consolidate with, merge into or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties
and assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or IPO Entity, (b) the Issuer may merge or consolidate with an
Affiliate incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Issuer in another
jurisdiction that is a Permitted Jurisdiction, so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is not increased thereby, (c) the Issuer may convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership,
limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer
or any Permitted Jurisdiction and (d) the Transactions may occur (any transaction described in this sentence, a
“Specified Merger/Transfer Transaction”).

The Indenture will further provide that subject to certain limitations in the Indenture governing release of a

Guarantee upon the sale or disposition of a Subsidiary Guarantor, each Subsidiary Guarantor will not, and the Issuer
will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such
Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person (herein called the
“Successor Guarantor”) unless:

(i) the surviving company (or company to which assets are transferred) in such liquidation, merger,
sale, transfer or other disposition is the Issuer or a Guarantor; or

(ii) such sale or disposition or consolidation or merger is not in violation of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales;” or

(iii) (1) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that

becomes an obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time of
such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(2) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) shall have delivered or caused to
be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which may
be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) stating that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture complies with the Indenture; and

(3) the Successor Guarantor expressly assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under the
Indenture and the notes, pursuant to a supplemental indenture.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be

substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, as applicable, and such Guarantor
will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s
Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in the proceeding paragraphs of this covenant, (1) a Guarantor

may merge or consolidate with an Affiliate (including any IPO Entity) incorporated or organized solely for the purpose
of reincorporating or reorganizing such Guarantor in another jurisdiction that is a Permitted Jurisdiction, so long as
the amount of Indebtedness of the Guarantor is not increased thereby, (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may amalgamate,
merge or consolidate with or into, or wind up into, liquidate, dissolve, or sell, assign, lease, convey, transfer or
otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties or assets to a Restricted Subsidiary or the Issuer, and (3) a Subsidiary
Guarantor may convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized
or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or any Permitted Jurisdiction.

279


-----

This “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” covenant will not apply to (i) any

transaction or arrangement pursuant to a Specified Merger/Transfer Transaction or an IPO Pushdown, (ii) a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer in order to comply with any law, rule, regulation or order, recommendation or direction of, or agreement

Permitted Parent Reorganization or (iv) a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between
or among the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Permitted

**Defaults**

An “Event of Default” will be defined in the Indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any note when the same
becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any note when due at its Stated Maturity,
upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer for 120 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the holders
of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (with a copy to the
Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the provisions
of the Indenture described in “Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain covenants—Reports and Other Information” or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall
be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in
the Indenture;

(4) the failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written
notice given by the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with its other obligations, covenants
or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above) contained in the
notes or the Indenture;

(5) the failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer to pay any Indebtedness for
borrowed money (other than Indebtedness owing to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any
Permitted Securitization Financing which is non-recourse to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such
Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount of such
Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds the greater of (A) 25% of EBITDA as of the Applicable
Test Date and (B) €40 million or its foreign currency equivalent;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer to pay final and non-appealable
judgments aggregating in excess the greater of (A) 25% of EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date
and (B) €40 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by
enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not discharged,
waived or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final and, in the event such
judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

280


-----

(8) a material portion of the Guarantees with respect to the notes provided by the Guarantors cease to
be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or shall be asserted in
writing by any Guarantor not to be in effect or not to be legal, valid and binding obligations (other
than in accordance with the terms thereof) and such Default continues for 30 days after written
notice of such Default shall have been given by the Trustee;

(9) failure by TopCo to comply with its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Security
Documents and any such Default continues for 30 days after written notice of such Default shall
have been given to the Trustee; or

(10) unless such Liens have been released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, the Liens in favor of the holders of the notes with respect
to all or substantially all of the Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable and any such Default
continues for 30 days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and

whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is affected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order
of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a Default under clause (3) or (4) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the

holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes notify the Issuer of the Default and the
Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clause (3) or (4) hereof after receipt of such notice;
_provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to a breach by the Issuer of its obligations, covenants_
or agreements pursuant to clause (3) or (4) above which occurred more than two years prior to such notice of Default.
Any time period providing for the cure of any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default described under the first
paragraph of this section may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or
alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or

reorganization of the Issuer) is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding notes by written notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default
relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on the notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the
part of the Trustee or any holders of the notes. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal
amount of outstanding notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default

and all consequences thereof (including, without limitation, the declaration of acceleration of the notes) will be
annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the notes, if
within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that
(x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders
thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, default, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such
Event of Default or (z) the default or acceleration that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured or waived.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default

occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy
with respect to the Indenture or the notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

281


-----

(2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes have requested
in writing that the Trustee pursue the remedy;

(4) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense;

(5) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(6) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a
direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a

responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use
the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes are given

the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee
or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction
that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other
holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee
will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses
caused by taking or not taking such action.

Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event

of Default under the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to provide (i) a notice of Default under
the first paragraph of this section or (ii) a notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first
paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing
**Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that**
such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing
**System”) or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners**
that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction
relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or
otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. Subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law and without
prejudice to what is provided for in paragraph “—Meeting of Holders of the Notes” below, any Directing Holder that
does not provide a Position Representation with a Noteholder Direction shall not be eligible to vote or direct its interest
as a Holder in respect of such Noteholder Direction. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing
a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably
request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant
Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant
required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or
the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the Issuer

determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (which shall be
provided by the Issuer to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable
basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification
Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing
Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such
matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in
accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy

282


-----

its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time,
not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with
respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed
pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant.

Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such

Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of
notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly
provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event
of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be
deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default,
shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder
Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant or a court
of competent jurisdiction has ruled that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position
Representation or its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such
Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve
the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee
shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken
by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction
(provided that the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance with the provisions of the preceding
paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation
or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any Agent) shall not be liable

to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any
Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine
in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if
a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) to investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position
Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) to inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if
a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) to enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) to monitor
any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) to monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event
of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) to otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations
with respect to any Net Short position or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights, protections and
benefits under the Indenture at all times, including without limitation for actions that are taken and subsequently stayed
or annulled.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee

may on behalf of the holders of the notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under
the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or Additional Amounts on,
or the principal of, the notes.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s

Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after becoming aware of any events which constitute certain
Defaults that are continuing, written notice of such events, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes
to take in respect thereof, it being understood that the Indenture will provide that if a Default or an Event of Default
occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at
the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection
with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to

provide a notice of Default or notice of acceleration may not be given by the Trustee or holders of the notes (or any
other action taken on the assertion of any Default) with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders
of the notes, more than two years prior to such notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to
provide a notice of default or notice of acceleration (or other action).

283


-----

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is complying with

its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of
Default or other event that would require redemption of the Notes has occurred.

The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to what is provided for in paragraph “—Meeting of

_Holders of the Notes” below._

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture, the notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the

Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (together, the “Notes Documents”) may be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such notes) and any existing or past default or compliance with any
provisions of such documents may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such notes); provided, in each case, that if any amendment, waiver or other modification
will only affect one series of the notes, only the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
then outstanding notes of such series (and not the consent of at least a majority of all notes then outstanding), shall be
required.

However, without the consent of the holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of the notes

affected then outstanding, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of notes whose holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any
note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any note or change the time at which any such
premium is payable as described under “—Optional Redemption;”

(5) make any note payable in money other than that stated in such note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on such holder’s notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s notes;

(7) expressly subordinate the notes or any Guarantee related thereto to any other Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Guarantor other than as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Additional Amounts” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such notes in any material respect or amends the terms
of such notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the Issuer and the Guarantors agree to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(9) release (i) all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the holders in the
Collateral or (ii) any Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security
Documents or the Indenture, as applicable, and except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement;

284


-----

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on, the notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the notes by the holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes, and a waiver of the
Default or Event of Default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions that require the holders’ consent described
in clauses (1) through (10) of this sentence,

provided that if any such amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one series of notes then outstanding under
the Indenture and does not or would not affect holders of the notes generally, then only the consent of the holders of
not less than 75% in principal amount of the notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the notes)
shall be required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of the notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and the

Security Agent (if applicable) may amend any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency, as set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate provided to the Trustee;

(2) provide for the assumption by a Successor Company of the obligations of the Issuer under any of
the documents referenced above;

(3) provide for the additions of guarantees of the notes or Collateral or the assumption by a Successor
Guarantor of the obligations of a Guarantor under any of the documents referenced above;

(4) add to the covenants of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the benefit of the holders of the
notes or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect or
that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the notes or the Trustee;

(6) provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

(7) provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes;

(8) comply with the covenant relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets;

(11) conform the text of the Indenture, the notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees to any
provision of this Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the
Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of the Indenture, the notes, the Security Documents
or the Guarantees;

(12) evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee or security agent;
_provided that the successor trustee or security agent, as applicable, is otherwise qualified and eligible_
to act as such under the terms of any of the documents referenced above;

(13) provide for the succession of any parties to the Indenture (and other amendments that are
administrative or ministerial in nature) and any of the other documents referenced above;

285


-----

(14) provide for a reduction in the minimum denominations of the notes;

(15) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of the
notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and
administration of the notes; provided that compliance with the Indenture as so amended may not
result in the notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities
laws as determined in good faith by the Issuer;

(16) provide for the assumption by one or more successors of the obligations of any of the Guarantors
under any of the documents referenced above;

(17) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(18) mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, grant, perfect or extend a security interest in favor of the Security
Agent (for the benefit of the holders of the notes or the parties to the Credit Agreement), in any
property which is required by the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Credit
Agreement to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to
be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit
of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture
and the covenant described under “—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(19) make any amendment of an administrative or ministerial nature to the provisions of the Indenture
to facilitate an IPO Pushdown;

(20) add any Guarantee or collateral with respect to the notes; or

(21) add, release, terminate, discharge or retake the security interests created by the Security Documents
or any Guarantees as provided by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and provide evidence in respect thereof.

The consent of the holders of the notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of

any proposed amendment, waiver or consent. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment, waiver or consent. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of notes
given in connection with a tender of such holder’s notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

The Indenture also will provide that each holder, by accepting a note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and

accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether
then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business
hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

For so long as the notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules

of such exchange so require, the Issuer will inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any of the foregoing
amendments, supplements and waivers and public a notice of any of the foregoing amendments, supplements and
waivers on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com) to the extent required by, and in the
manner permitted by, the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clauses (3) and (9) above or

as contemplated by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” in each case in respect
of the provision of a Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the notes, a supplemental indenture providing for the
accession of such Guarantor shall be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, such additional Guarantor and the
Trustee (and no other party).

286


-----

The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to what is provided for in paragraph “—Meeting of

_Holders of the Notes” below._

**Meeting of Holders of the Notes**

A meeting of the Holders of the notes will be convened to the extent required by article 2415 of the Italian

Civil Code and a resolution resulting from any such meeting will be sanctioned in accordance with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law. All meetings of Holders of the notes will be held in accordance with Italian applicable laws
and regulations.

In addition to the provisions described above under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”, in

accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil Code, the Indenture will include provisions for the
convening of meetings of the Holders of the notes to consider any matter affecting their interests, including, without
limitation, the modification or abrogation by extraordinary resolution of any provisions of the notes or the Indenture.
A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, (ii) by the Noteholders’ Representative
(if appointed) (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least 5.0% of the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the Holders

of the notes will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of more than
one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any further
adjourned meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or further adjourned meeting will be
validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or represent Holders of more than one-third of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes; provided, however, that the Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a
higher quorum (to the extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals, as set out under Article 2415 paragraph
1, item 2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the amendment of the economic terms and conditions of
the notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary resolution passed at a meeting of Holders of the notes (including
any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons present that hold or represent holders of not less than one-half of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver,”

and to the extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to pass an extraordinary
resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuer may amend certain
_economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all the holders of the Notes with the vote of_
_either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.” Any resolution duly passed at any_
such meeting shall be binding on all the holders of the notes, whether or not such holder was present at such meeting
or voted to approve such resolution. To the extent provided by the Italian Civil Code, the resolutions passed by a
meeting of Holders of the notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant to Articles 2377 and 2379 of the Italian Civil
Code.

The Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” will be

in addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and
_Waiver.” As such and notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to_
complying with the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of the Notes” must also comply with the
other provisions described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

This section “—Meeting of Holders of the Notes” is subject to compliance with Italian law in all respects.

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the

notes on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the Holders of the

287


-----

notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of the Security Agent, as security representative (rappresentante
_per le garanzie) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security Representative”)_
in order to create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees securing and guaranteeing the notes and entitle
it to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders of the notes all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security interests and guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture
each Holder of the notes from time to time, by accepting a note, shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the
appointment of the Security Agent as Security Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the Holders of the notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’

**Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the Holders of**
the notes in order to represent the interests of the Holders of the notes pursuant to Article 2418 of the Italian Civil
Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Holders of the notes. If the Noteholders’
Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the Holders of the notes, the Noteholders’ Representative shall be
appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has its registered office upon request by one or more Holders of
the notes or upon request by the directors of the Issuer. The Noteholders’ Representative remains appointed for a
maximum period of three financial years but may be subsequently reappointed thereafter.

This section “—Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative” is subject to compliance with

Italian law in all respects.

**Italian Usury Law**

Notwithstanding any provisions in the Indenture to the contrary, (x) the Issuer and each Guarantor (by signing

the Indenture and any supplemental indenture, as applicable) and (y) each holder (by accepting a note) shall be deemed
to have acknowledged, accepted and agreed that, if the remuneration applicable to the notes (including interest, default
interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of compensation related to the notes (the “Total
**Remuneration”)) at any time exceeds the maximum remuneration permitted under Italian law no. 108 of March 7,**
1996, as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations (the “Italian Usury Law”), then
the Total Remuneration shall immediately and automatically be reduced to the maximum admissible remuneration
pursuant to the Italian Usury Law for, and limited to, the period during which it is not possible to apply the
remuneration as originally provided.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, manager, authorized signatory, incorporator or holder of any equity interests

in the Issuer or any Parent or any Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the
Guarantors under the notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each holder of the notes by accepting such note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to
waive liabilities under the federal securities laws under local contract and tort laws and/or under local company laws.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding notes when:

(1) either (a) all the notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed notes which

have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in
trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged
from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the notes not
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and
payable at their stated maturity within one year or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Issuer, are
to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the
Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or an
entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for this purpose) funds in amount sufficient to pay

288


-----

and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes to the date of deposit (in the
case of notes that have become due and payable) or to the date of maturity or redemption, as
applicable, together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the Trustee (or an entity
designated or appointed (as agent) by it for this purpose) to apply or cause to be applied such funds
to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be; _provided_ that upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee
(or an entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for this purpose) equal to the Applicable
Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in each case calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption (and any such deficit will be set forth
in a written notice delivered to the holders and the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed (as
agent) by it for this purpose) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the redemption date) only
required to be deposited with the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for
this purpose) on or prior to the date of the redemption;

(2) the Issuer and/or the Guarantors have paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) stating that all conditions precedent under
the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of such Indenture have been complied with;
_provided that any such counsel may rely on such Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including_
as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1) and (2)).

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations and all obligations of the Guarantors under the notes

and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing
temporary notes, registrations of notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust). The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under certain covenants that are described in
the Indenture, including the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,” the operation of the cross-acceleration
provision, the bankruptcy provisions and the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security
default provision described under “—Defaults” and the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of
_Control” and “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” (“covenant defeasance”). If the_
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor will be released from
all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee and will cease to be subject to the Indenture.

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise

of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to the notes, payment
of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the notes, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event
of Default specified in clauses (3), (4) (with respect to any Default by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
with any of its obligations under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”), (5), (6) (only with respect to
a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Defaults.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance

**trust”) with the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) money or**
euro-denominated European Government Obligations, which shall be delivered to the Trustee (or an entity designated
or appointed (as agent) by it for this purpose), for the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the notes
to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to
the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions to the effect that the beneficial
owners of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such

289


-----

deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case
of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling received from or published by the Internal
Revenue Service or a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law); _provided_ that upon any redemption that
requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture
to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for this
purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in each case calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption (and any such deficit will be set forth in a
written notice delivered to the holders and the Trustee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the redemption date)
only required to be deposited with the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for this purpose)
on or prior to the date of the redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to a legal defeasance need not be delivered if all notes not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) are due and payable within one year or (y) have been or will become due
and payable within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in

connection with the notes and Guarantees thereof is euro, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any holder or by the Trustee,
in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the
Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with
the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If that euro amount
is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any note, the Issuer and the
Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event,
the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of
making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of
the matter stated therein for the holder of a note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise
to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder of a note or
the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any
other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any note, any Guarantee
or to the Trustee.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide

that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent
Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee, the Security Agent, Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be permitted to

engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee, the Security Agent or
any Agent becomes the holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same
rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer
Agent.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such

terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the holders of a majority in

290


-----

principal amount of the then outstanding notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and
(2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable
of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any holder who has
been a bona fide holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment
of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by

the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and

expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of

the holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any of the notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange shall so require, notices with respect to the notes will be
published in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort)
or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange (www.luxse.com). For so long as any notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to holders will be
delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.
Such notices may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com), to the extent
and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Description of the Notes,” the notice requirements in the

Indenture will be subject to the applicable rules of Euroclear and Clearstream for so long as the notes are represented
by Global Notes. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream concerning the content,
timing or procedure for delivering notices conflict with any requirements applicable to notices under the Indenture, a
notice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the Indenture if it complies with such mandatory rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements under the
Indenture.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more

than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent
means and shall be sufficiently given to such holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice
or communication to a holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other holders. If a notice
or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any, on

the notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for the payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer
or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the substantial majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United

States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

291


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the notes and

the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will, in the Indenture, (a) in the case of the Issuer or a Guarantor not
organized in the United States, appoint a Guarantor or other entity organized in the United States as its agent for
service of process and (b) irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the notes and the Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be

governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law
principles to the extent the law of another jurisdiction would be applied thereby (unless indicated otherwise herein, in
particular the provisions relating to the meeting of the noteholders, the security representative and the representative
of the noteholders that shall be subject to compliance with Italian laws).

period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date, will
be given _pro forma_ effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial
officer) as if they (and the change of any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period, and
if since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary

shall have made or determined to make any dispositions, consolidations, acquisitions and other
Investments, operational changes, business realignment projects or initiatives, restructurings,
reorganizations or Irrevocable Repayments that would have required adjustment pursuant to this
definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto
for such period as if such dispositions, consolidations, acquisitions and other Investments,
discontinued operations, operational changes, business realignment projects, cost saving initiatives
or other initiatives, New Projects, restructurings, reorganizations, capital expenditures,
constructions, repairs, replacements, improvements, equipment optimization programs or
Irrevocable Repayments had occurred (or such operational or cost savings had been realized) at the

event that is contemplated by the definition of “Specified Change of Control Event” (any such
transaction, a “Specified Change of Control Transaction”), and solely for the purpose of making the
determination pursuant to “Specified Change of Control Event,” EBITDA for such period shall be
calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including anticipated synergies and expenses and
cost savings expected to be obtained from the Specified Change of Control Transaction) as if such
Specified Change of Control Transaction (including such synergies and expenses and cost savings)
had occurred on the first day of such period;

(3) the EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in good faith by a responsible
accounting or financial officer, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein)
disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded;

(4) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in good faith by a
responsible accounting or financial officer, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests
therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be obligations of the specified Person or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(5) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(6) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period;

(7) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and such Indebtedness is to be given pro forma
effect, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging
Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term as at
the Calculation Date in excess of 12 months, or, if shorter, at least equal to the remaining term of
such Indebtedness); and

(8) interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation will be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably
determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the specified Person to be the rate of
interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of EBITDA, Fixed Charges and Consolidated Net

Income, calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer
(including in respect of anticipated cost savings and synergies) as though the full effect of synergies and cost savings
were realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run rate cost
savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer) of cost savings
programs and synergies that have been initiated by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries as though such cost savings
programs and synergies had been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant period. Any such _pro forma_
calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith determination of the Issuer, to reflect
(1) all adjustments of the nature used in connection with the calculation of “Run Rate Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA”
(as defined elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum) for the _pro forma_ twelve months ended December 31, 2023
included in this Offering Memorandum and (2) anticipated run-rate EBITDA reasonably expected to be achieved (in
the good faith determination of the Issuer) from New Projects (and the achievement of related operating expense

Project is then committed or expected to be initiated (in each case, unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise), under
development or is otherwise in process.

The Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that

immediately after giving effect to such designation:

(x) (1) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary could Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness as Ratio Debt;

immediately prior to such designation or (II) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be less than or equal to such ratio for the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such designation,

in each case on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation; and

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by

one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”).

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more

global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited with,
or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as
operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered in
the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary. Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered,
global form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be
issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Restricted Book Entry Interests”)

and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book Entry Interests” and, together
with the Rule 144A Restricted Book Entry Interests, the “Book Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants or otherwise in
accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture and any applicable securities laws of any state
of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.

Book Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained

in book entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or
pledge Book Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book Entry Interests will not
be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or

its nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the
Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective

agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their

respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book Entry Interests in such Global Note from
the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary will surrender
such Global Note to the Paying Agent for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common Depositary
will request the Paying Agent to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in
the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in
connection with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate

341


-----

basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided,
however, that, subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, no Book Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,

premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent who will make payment to or to the order
of the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts
without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of
_the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent_
described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book Entry Interests
after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise
received in respect of such Global Note or Book Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or
deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent

or any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the Common Depositary (or
its nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective agents
has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book Entry Interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility

of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of,

premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to holders
of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euros.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of

the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor any
of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs,
losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with
any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a

holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which
such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any
discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes.

342


-----

However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”),
and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of

Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may change
from time to time.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book Entry Interests in

the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Restricted Book Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A

Restricted Book Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing
on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Rule 144A Restricted Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of

a Regulation S Book Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided
in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any
other exemption (if available) under the Securities Act.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book Entry Interest for a Rule 144A

Restricted Book Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of
the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the

form of a Book Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book Entry Interests in such
other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book Entry Interest.

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Exchange’s Euro

MTF Market and to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange upon their issuance. Transfers of interests in the
Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance
with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to
time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers

of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified
at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes if:

    - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for
the Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor;

    - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

343


-----

    - the owner of a Book Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

    - Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book Entry Interest, its current
procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to
all owners of Book Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes (subject to receipt of the same from the

Issuer), registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required
by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent

and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may

transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of
the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
_provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000,_
in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the
Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the
maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes

have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent)
will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The
Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an
indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a
Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered
Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to

become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book Entry Interests in a Global Note

only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

So long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Exchange’s Euro MTF Market and listed on the Official

List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of
Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation. Payment of principal, any repurchase price,
premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in 125 Old
Broad Street, 5th Floor, London, EC2N 1AR, United Kingdom so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the
Exchange’s Euro MTF Market and listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require.

344


-----

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book Entry System Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or

Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional euro bonds in registered form.
Book Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same

day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be
made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other

communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions

involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may
find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or
Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**Clearing Information**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and

Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes numbers for the Notes are set out
under “Listing and General Information.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely

as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement
systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective
agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems
or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance

and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such
as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account

holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such

345


-----

interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing
industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book Entry Interests or if an
owner of a Book Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the
Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book Entry Interest to give or
take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would
otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive

form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule
144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

346


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**OECD Common Reporting Standards**

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has developed a common

reporting standard (“CRS”) to achieve a comprehensive and multilateral automatic exchange of information on a
global basis. A number of jurisdictions (including Italy) signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority
agreement (“Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS.

The CRS requires certain financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may

include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence procedures.
A jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement may provide this information to other jurisdictions that have signed the
Agreement.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any

financial institution resident in a jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement (including Italy) through which payments
on the Notes are made.

The holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisors on

the individual impact of CRS on their position.

**Certain Italian Tax Considerations**

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws in force and published practices of the

Italian tax authorities in force in Italy as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any changes in
law and interpretation occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. In particular,
law of 9 August 2023, no.111 has delegated the Italian government to enact a comprehensive review of the Italian tax
system which may affect the Italian tax regime described hereinafter. The Issuer will not update this summary to
reflect changes in laws and if such changes occur the information in this summary may become invalid. The following
summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to a
decision to subscribe for, purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences
applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities) may be subject
to additional or special rules. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors
concerning the overall tax consequences of their ownership of the Notes. The following summary assumes that the
Issuer is resident only in Italy for tax purposes and that the Notes will be listed on the Exchange’s Euro MTF Market
upon their issuance.

In any case, Italian legal concepts may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English term

as they exist under terms of different jurisdictions and any legal concept expressed by using the relevant Italian term
shall prevail over the corresponding concept expressed in English terms.

**_Tax Treatment of the Notes Issued by the Issuer_**

Decree 239 provides for the applicable regime with respect to the tax treatment of interest, premium and

other income (including the difference between the redemption amount and the issue price, hereinafter collectively
referred to as “Interest”) deriving from Notes falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) or securities similar
to bonds (titoli similari alle obbligazioni), pursuant to Article 44 of Italian Presidential Decree No. 917 of 22
December 1986, as amended and supplemented (“Decree 917”), according to which securities qualify as obbligazioni
_o titoli similari alle obbligazioni (bonds or securities similar to bonds), if they:_

(i) incorporate an unconditional obligation to pay at maturity an amount not lower than their nominal
value or principal amount;

(ii) attribute to the holders no direct or indirect right to control or participate in the management of the
Issuer or in the management of the business in respect of which the Notes have been issued; and

347


-----

(iii) not provide for a remuneration which is entirely linked to profits of the Issuer, or other companies
belonging to the same group or to the business in respect of which the Notes have been issued.

Decree 239 regulates the tax treatment of Interest related to bonds or similar securities to the extent they are,

_inter alia:_

(A) issued by companies whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a multi-lateral trading
platform of EU Member States or of the States party to the EEA Agreement included in the White
List; or

(B) listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading platform of EU Member States or of the
States party to the EEA Agreement included in the White List; or

(C) subscribed, transferred to and held by qualified investors (as defined under Article 100 of the
Financial Services Act) only.

**_Tax Treatment of Interest—Italian Resident Noteholders_**

_Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Where the beneficial owner of the Notes (the “Noteholder”) is an Italian resident and is:

(i) an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected;

(ii) a partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita semplice or similar
partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities (società semplice) or
professional association;

(iii) a non-commercial private or public institution, trusts not carrying out mainly or exclusively
commercial activities, the Italian State and public and territorial entities; or (iv) an investor

exempt from Italian corporate income taxation,

Interest deriving from the Notes and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a withholding

tax, referred to as imposta sostitutiva, levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon disposal
of the Notes) unless the Noteholder holds the Notes in a discretionary investment portfolio managed by an authorized
intermediary and, under certain conditions, has validly opted for the application of the _risparmio gestito_ regime
provided for by Article 7 of Decree 461 (see “Capital gains tax” below).

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Interest may be

exempt from any income taxation (including the 26% _imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders are Italian resident_
individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509
of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term
savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Italian law
as amended and supplemented from time to time.

_Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

In the event that the Italian resident Noteholders described under (i) and (iii) above are engaged in an

entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax. Interest
will be subject to 26% _imposta sostitutiva_ on a provisional basis and will then be included in the relevant Italian
resident noteholder’s annual income tax return. As a consequence, Interest will be subject to Italian ordinary income
taxation and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a credit that can be offset against the income tax due.

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent

establishment in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited

348


-----

with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest from the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must
be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are therefore subject to the Italian corporate tax
(“IRES”) and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, the regional tax on productive
activities (“IRAP”).

_Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_

Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate investment funds and Italian

real estate investment companies with fixed capital (società di investimento a capitalefisso or “SICAFs”)

established pursuant to Article 37 of the Financial Services Act, as amended and supplemented, or Article

14-bis of Law No. 86 of 25 January 1994 (together the “Real Estate Funds”) provided that the Notes, together with
the coupons relating thereto, are timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Intermediary (as defined below) are
subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax in the hands of the Real Estate Funds. Subsequent
distributions made in favour of unitholders or shareholders and income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in
the event of redemption or sale of the units or shares will be subject, in certain circumstances, to a withholding tax of
26%. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, depending on the status of the investor and percentage of participation,
income realized by Real Estate Funds is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective
of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units or shares on a tax transparency basis.

_Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_

If the Noteholder is resident in Italy and is an open-ended or closed-ended investment fund (other than a Real

Estate Funds), a SICAF (other than a Real Estate Funds) or an investment company with variable capital (società di
_investimento a capitale variabile, or “SICAV”) established in Italy (together, the “Funds”) and either (i) the Funds_
or (ii) their manager are subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the relevant Notes are deposited with
an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest accrued during the holding period on such Notes will not be subject to
_imposta sostitutiva, nor to any other income tax in the hands of the Funds. Subsequent distributions made in favour of_
unitholders or shareholders and income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in the event of redemption or sale
of the units or shares will be subject, in certain circumstances, to a withholding tax of 26%.

_Pension funds_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of

the Legislative Decree No. 252 of 5 December 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined
below), Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva
but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period to be subject to a 20%
substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year. Subject to certain
conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) Interest relating to the Notes may be
excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account
(piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Italian tax law as amended and
supplemented from time to time.

_Application of the imposta sostitutiva_

Pursuant to Decree 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by Italian resident banks, investment companies

(società di intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies, asset management companies (società di
_gestione del risparmio, or “SGR”), stockbrokers and other entities identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance_
or Italian permanent establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each an “Intermediary”).

An Intermediary must:

(A) be (i) resident in Italy; or (ii) a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial
intermediary; or (iii) an entity or a company not resident in Italy, acting through a system of

349


-----

centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Italian Tax Authorities
having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree 239; and

(B) intervene, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of
the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act,
either with or without consideration, which results in a change of the ownership of the relevant
Notes or in a change of the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

Where the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by

the relevant Intermediary paying Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are
Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are
effectively connected are entitled to deduct the suffered imposta sostitutiva from income taxes due.

**_Tax Treatment of Interest—Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_**

Where the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes

are connected, an exemption from the imposta sostitutiva applies, provided that the non-Italian resident Noteholder is
either:

(i) the beneficial owner of relevant Interest and is resident, for tax purposes, in a country which allows
for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy listed in the White List; or

(ii) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have
entered into force in Italy; or

(iii) a Central Bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State; or

(iv) an institutional investor which is established in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange
of information with Italy listed in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of taxpayer
therein and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration
of being an institutional investor.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owners of the

payments of Interest (or certain non-resident institutional investors) and must deposit the Notes together with any
related coupons since the issue date directly or indirectly with:

(i) an Italian or non-Italian resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the bank
or financial institution to be an EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the
deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as
defined below); or

(ii) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank
or SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct
relationships, via telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (the “Second Level Bank”). Organizations and companies that are not resident of Italy,
acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the
Department of Revenue of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (which include Euroclear
and Clearstream) are treated as Second Level Banks, provided that they appoint an Italian
representative (an Italian resident bank or SIM, or the permanent establishment in Italy of a nonItalian resident bank or SIM, or a central depositary of financial instruments pursuant to Article 80
of the Financial Services Act) for the purposes of the application of Decree 239. If a non-Italian
resident Noteholder deposits the Notes directly with a Second Level Bank, the latter shall be treated
both as a First Level Bank and a Second Level Bank.

The exemption from the imposta sostitutiva for non-Italian resident Noteholders is conditional upon:

350


-----

(i) the timely deposit of the Notes, either directly or indirectly, with an institution which qualifies as a
Second Level Bank; and

(ii) the timely submission to the First Level Bank or the Second Level Bank (as the case may be) of a
statement of the relevant Noteholder (autocertificazione), to be provided only once, in which it
declares, inter alia, that it is eligible to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva.

Such statement must comply with the requirements set forth by a Ministerial Decree dated December 12,

2001, is valid until withdrawn or revoked (unless some information provided therein has changed) and does not need
to be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document for the same or equivalent purposes was
previously submitted to the same depository. The above statement is not required for non-Italian resident investors
that are international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements entered into force in Italy
referred to in point b) above or Central Banks or entities also authorized to manage the official reserves of a State
referred to in point d) above. Additional requirements are provided for “institutional investors” referred to in point c)
above (in this respect see Circular No. 23/E of March 1, 2002 and No. 20/E of March 27, 2003).

The _imposta sostitutiva_ will be applicable at the rate of 26% (or at the reduced rate provided for by the

applicable double tax treaty, if any, and subject to timely filing of the required documentation) to Interest accrued by
Noteholders who are resident, for tax purposes, in countries which do not allow for a satisfactory exchange of
information with Italy listed in the White List.

**_Payments Made by an Italian Resident Guarantor_**

With respect to payments on the Notes made to Noteholders by an Italian resident Guarantor, in accordance

with one interpretation of Italian tax law, any payment of liabilities equal to Interest may be subject to a withholding
tax at the rate of 26% levied as a final or provisional tax (a titolo d’imposta or a titolo di acconto) depending on the
“status” and the tax residence of the beneficial owner of the Notes, pursuant to Italian Presidential Decree No. 600 of
29 September 1973, as subsequently amended. Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may also apply, allowing
for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate of withholding tax in case of payments to non-Italian resident Noteholders,
subject to compliance with relevant subjective and procedural requirements.

In accordance with an alternative interpretation, any such payment made by the Italian resident Guarantor

will be treated, in certain circumstances, as a payment by the Issuer and will thus be subject to the Italian tax regime
described above.

**_Fungible Issues_**

Pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 2 of Decree 239, where the relevant Issuer issues a new tranche of notes

forming part of a single series with a previous tranche of notes, for the purposes of calculating the amount of Interest
subject to imposta sostitutiva, the issue price of the new tranche of notes will be deemed to be the same amount as the
issue price of the original tranche of notes. This rule applies where (a) the new tranche of notes is issued within twelve
months of the issue date of the previous tranche of notes and (b) the difference between the issue price of the new
tranche of notes and that of the original tranche of notes does not exceed 1% multiplied by the number of years of the
duration of the notes.

_Tax Treatment of Capital Gains—Italian Resident Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Where an Italian resident Noteholder is (i) an individual holding the Notes not in connection with an

entrepreneurial activity, (ii) a non-commercial partnership (società semplice) or (iii) a non-commercial private or
public institution, any capital gain realized by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be
subject to an _imposta sostitutiva_ provided for by Decree 461, levied at the rate of 26% (“CGT”). Under certain
conditions and limitations Noteholders may set off capital losses with their capital gains.

In respect of the application of CGT, taxpayers may choose one of the three regimes described below:

351


-----

(A) under the tax declaration regime (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian
resident individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the
CGT on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains, net of any
incurred capital loss of the same kind, realized by the investor pursuant to all sales or redemptions
of the Notes carried out during any given tax year. The relevant Noteholder must indicate the overall
capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in
their annual tax return and pay CGT on such gains together with any balance of income tax due for
such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains
realized in any of the four succeeding tax years;

(B) as an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian resident individual not engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected may elect to pay the CGT separately on
capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (risparmio amministrato regime
provided for by Article 6 of Decree 461). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject
to (i) the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial
intermediary (including permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) and (ii) a valid
express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being timely made in writing by the relevant
Noteholder. The depository is responsible for accounting for CGT in respect of capital gains realized
on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the
revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss, and is required to pay the relevant amount
to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from
the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this
purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, where a sale or redemption of the Notes results
in a capital loss, such loss may be deducted only from capital gains subsequently realized, within
the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth.
Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains
in the annual tax return.

(C) any capital gains realized by Italian resident individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to
which the Notes are connected who have entrusted the management of their financial assets,
including the Notes, to an authorized intermediary and have opted for the so called risparmio gestito
regime provided for by Article 7 of Decree 461 will be included in the computation of the annual
increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at year end, subject to a
substitute tax at a rate of 26%, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Under the
_risparmio gestito regime, any depreciation of the managed assets accrued at year end may be carried_
forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding
tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains realized in its annual tax return.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident

individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected may be exempt from Italian
capital gain taxes, including the CGT, on capital gains realized upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes, if the
Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that
meets the requirements set forth by Italian law, as amended and implemented from time to time.

_Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Any capital gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of the taxable

income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of the net value of the
production for IRAP purposes) if realized by an Italian company or a similar commercial entity (including the Italian
permanent establishment of foreign entities to which the Notes are connected), Italian resident commercial partnership
or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected.

_Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is a Real Estate Fund will be subject neither to CGT nor to

any other income tax at the level of the Real Estate Fund. Subsequent distributions made in favour of unitholders or

352


-----

shareholders and income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in the event of redemption or sale of the units or
shares will be subject, in certain circumstances, to a withholding tax of 26%. Moreover, subject to certain conditions,
depending on the status of the investor and percentage of participation, income realized by Real Estate Funds is
attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion
to the percentage of ownership of units or shares on a tax transparency basis.

_Funds_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is a Fund will not be subject to CGT but will be included in

the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period which is exempt from income tax.
Subsequent distributions made in favour of unitholders or shareholders and income realized by the unitholders or
shareholders in the event of redemption or sale of the units or shares will be subject, in certain circumstances, to a
withholding tax of 26%.

_Pension funds_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for

by Article 17 of the Legislative Decree No. 252 of 5 December 2005) will be included in the result of the relevant
portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to the 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions and
limitations (including minimum holding period requirement), capital gains on the Notes may be excluded from the
taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a
_lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Italian law, as amended and supplemented from time to time._

**_Tax Treatment of Capital Gains—Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_**

Capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders, not having a permanent establishment in Italy to

which the Notes are connected, from the sale or redemption of Notes traded on regulated markets in Italy or abroad
are neither subject to the CGT nor to any other Italian income tax (subject to timely filling of required documentation
(in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes) with Italian qualified
intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are deposited,
even if the Notes are held in Italy and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax treaty). Italian
tax authorities have clarified (Italian Revenue Agency Circular Letter No. 32 of 23 December 2020) that the notion
of multilateral trading facility (MTF) under EU Directive 2014/65/CE (so called MiFID II) can be assimilated to that
of “regulated market” for income tax purposes; conversely, organized trading facilities (OTF), not falling in the
definition of MTF under MiFID II, cannot be assimilated to “regulated market” for income tax purposes.

Capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes not traded

on regulated markets and held in Italy are not subject to the CGT, provided that the effective beneficiary is:

(i) resident, for tax purposes, in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with
Italy listed in the White List;

(ii) an international entity or body set up in accordance with international agreements which have
entered into force in Italy;

(iii) a Central Bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State; or

(iv) an institutional investor which is established in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange
of information with Italy listed in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of taxpayer
therein and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration
of being an institutional investor.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set forth

above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree 239 (see “Tax treatment
_of interest”)._

353


-----

If none of the conditions above is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the

sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes not traded on regulated markets and held in Italy are subject to the CGT at
the current rate of 26%. In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment in
Italy to which the Notes are connected that may benefit from a double taxation treaty with Italy providing that capital
gains realized upon the sale or redemption of Notes are to be taxed only in the country of tax residence of the recipient,
will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes.

**_Italian Inheritance and Gift Taxes_**

Pursuant to Law No. 346 of 31 October 1990 and Law No. 286 of 24 November 2006, as subsequently

amended, the transfers of any valuable asset (including the Notes) as a result of gift, donation or succession of Italian
residents and non-Italian residents (but in such latter case limited to assets held within the Italian territory which, for
presumption of law, includes bonds issued by Italian resident issuers) are subject to Italian inheritance and gift taxes
as follows:

(a) transfers in favour of the spouse and direct descendants or direct ancestors are subject to an
inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 4% on the value of the inheritance or the gift exceeding,
for each beneficiary, a threshold of €1,000,000;

(b) transfers in favour of relatives up to the fourth degree or relatives-in-law up to the third degree are
subject to an inheritance and gift tax at a rate of 6% on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift.
Transfers in favour of brothers/sisters are subject to the 6% inheritance and gift tax on the value of
the inheritance or the gift exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of €100,000; and

(c) any other transfer is, in principle, subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 8% on the
entire value of the inheritance or the gift.

With respect to Notes listed on regulated markets (including multilateral trading facilities), the value for

inheritance and gift tax purposes is the average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the
succession or of the gift (including any accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance tax
and gift tax purposes is generally determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar features
or based on certain elements as presented in the Italian tax law.

If the transfer is made in favour of persons with severe disabilities, the tax is levied at the rate mentioned

above in (a), (b) and (c) on the value exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of €1,500,000.

The transfer of financial instruments as a result of death is exempt from inheritance tax when such financial

instruments are included in a long-term saving account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets
the requirements set forth by Italian law, as amended and supplemented from time to time.

**_Transfer Tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the following registration tax: (i) public deeds

and notarized deeds are subject to fixed registration tax at a rate of €200.00; and (ii) private deeds are subject to fixed
registration tax at a rate of €200.00 only in the case of voluntary registration (registrazione volontaria), explicit
reference (enunciazione) or case of use (caso d’uso).

**_Stamp Duty_**

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Tariff Part I attached to Italian Presidential Decree No. 642 of 26 October 1972,

as amended and supplemented, a proportional stamp duty applies, on an annual basis, to the periodic reporting
communications and reports sent by Italian financial intermediaries to their clients in relation to the financial products
(including the Notes) that are deposited which such intermediaries. The stamp duty applies at a rate of 0.2%. A
minimum stamp tax of €34.20 is due on a yearly basis, where no specific exemptions applies and the tax cannot exceed
€14,000 for taxpayers other than individuals.

354


-----

This stamp duty is determined on the basis of the market value or if no market value is available on the

nominal value or the redemption amount of any financial product or financial instruments or in the case the nominal
or redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial asset (including the Notes) resulting
from any periodic reporting communication issued by the Italian financial intermediary with which the Notes are
deposited (determined in proportion to the reporting period).

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy on

24 May 2012, the stamp duty applies to any investor who is a client (as defined in the regulations issued by the Bank
of Italy) of an entity that exercises in any form a banking, financial or insurance activity within the Italian territory.
Stamp duty applies both to Italian resident and to non-Italian resident investors, to the extent that the relevant securities
(including the Notes) are held with an Italian-based financial intermediary (and not directly held by the investor outside
Italy, in which case Italian wealth tax (see below under “Wealth Tax on securities deposited abroad”) applies to
Italian-resident noteholders only).

**_Wealth Tax on Securities Deposited Abroad_**

Pursuant to Article 13 of the tariff Part I attached to Presidential Decree no. 642 of 26 October 1972 and

Article 19 of Decree No. 201 of 6 December 2011 (“Decree 201/2011”), converted with Law No. 214 of 22 December
2011, individuals, certain non-commercial entities, including trusts and foundations, and so called società semplici
(and similar partnerships pursuant to Article 5 of Decree 917) resident in Italy for tax purposes holding financial
assets, including the Notes, outside the Italian territory are required to declare in its own annual tax return and pay a
wealth tax (IVAFE) at a rate of 0.2% (0.4%, as of 2024, in case of financial assets held in States or territories with
privileged tax regime identified by the Ministerial Decree of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of May 4, 1999)
(determined in proportion to the period of ownership).

The tax is calculated on the market value of the financial assets (including the Notes) at the end of the relevant

year (or at the end of the holding period) or, if no market value is available, on the nominal value or redemption value
or in the case the nominal or redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of such financial assets
held outside the Italian territory. Taxpayers are entitled to an Italian tax credit equivalent to the amount of wealth taxes
paid in the State where the financial assets are held (up to an amount equal to the IVAFE due).

Pursuant to the provision of Article 134 of Law Decree 34 of May 19, 2020, the wealth tax cannot exceed

€14,000 per year for taxpayers different from individuals.

**_EU Savings Tax Directive and Implementation of the Automatic Exchange of Information in Italy_**

On 10 November 2015, the Council of the European Union approved the Council Directive 2015/2060/EU

(published in the Official Journal of the EU on November 18, 2015) which has repealed the Council Directive
2003/48/EU (the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) from January 1, 2016 in the case of all Member States other than
Austria and from January 1, 2017 in the case of Austria. This was intended to prevent overlap between the EU Savings
Tax Directive and the new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council Directive
2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU).
The new regime under Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is in accordance with the Common Reporting
Standard (CRS) released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in July 2014. Council
Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is generally broader in scope than the EU Saving Tax Directive, although it does
not impose withholding taxes.

Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS (and the

amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation) Italian Ministerial Decree dated December 28, 2015, which
has entered into force on January 1, 2016, has implemented Law 95/2015 and has provided for the exchange of
information starting from the calendar year 2016.

In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as defined in the

Italian Ministerial Decree of December 28, 2015 implementing Law 95/2015), they may be required to provide

355


-----

additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Italian
implementation of the CRS.

**_Italian Tax Monitoring Obligations_**

Italian resident individuals (and certain other entities) are required, in certain circumstances, to report in their

yearly income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must be filed within the
same time as prescribed for the income tax return), according to Legislative Decree No. 167 of 28 June 1990, converted
with amendments into law by Law No. 227 of August 4, 1990, as amended, for tax monitoring purposes, the amount
of securities, including notes, held abroad (or beneficially owned abroad under Italian anti-money laundering
provisions). This also applies in the case that at the end of the tax year, securities are no longer held by the above
Italian resident individuals and entities.

However, the above reporting obligation is not required where (i) the securities are deposited for management

with qualified Italian financial intermediaries and with respect to contracts entered into through their intervention,
provided that the same intermediaries apply a withholding tax or imposta sostitutiva on any income derived from the
securities or (ii) one of such intermediaries intervenes, also as a counterpart, in their transfer, provided that income
deriving from such financial assets has been subject to the applicable

withholding tax or substitute tax by the same intermediaries or (iii) the foreign financial investments are only

composed by deposits and/or bank accounts having an aggregate value not exceeding an €15,000.00 threshold
throughout the year.

The requirement applies also where the persons above, being not the direct holder of the financial

instruments, are the beneficial owner of the instrument.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The discussion below is a summary of current U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,

ownership and disposition of Notes. The following summary addresses only U.S. Holders (as defined herein) who
purchase the Notes for cash at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold for
money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and hold the Notes as
capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”). This summary does not address the tax consequences to subsequent purchasers of the Notes or holders who
have their Existing Notes redeemed hereunder.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is (i) an individual who is a

citizen or resident of the United States as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation (or other
entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S.
federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court
and one or more U.S. persons has the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has
made a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as
a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions

as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect), so as to result in U.S. federal
income tax consequences different from those summarized below. The discussion below does not cover all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein
will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including the impact of the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax or any alternative minimum tax), nor does it address any tax consequences
arising under U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing
jurisdiction. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with
respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different
position concerning the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Notes than those discussed

356


-----

herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that
assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an
investment in the Notes. In addition, this summary does not address tax consequences to U.S. Holders who may be
subject to special tax treatment, such as banks, dealers, traders that elect to mark to market, insurance companies,
financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, grantor trusts, U.S. expatriates,
mutual funds, tax-exempt entities, persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other integrated
financial transaction, investors in partnerships, S corporations, or other pass through entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “conversion transaction”, “constructive sale”
or other integrated financial transaction, holders that are required to take certain amounts into income no later than the
time such amounts are reflected on an applicable financial statement or U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is
not the U.S. dollar.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, income earned through a U.S. or non-U.S. partnership or other pass

through entity is attributed to its partners or owners. Accordingly, if a partnership or other pass through entity holds
the Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner or owner of such entity will generally depend on the
status of the partner or other owner and the activities of the partnership or other pass through entity that holds the
Notes. Tax consequences to partners or owners of a partnership or other pass through entity that is a U.S. Holder are
not discussed in this summary, and such investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors.

The summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences set out below is for general information only and

does not constitute, and should not be considered as, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors should consult their
own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of owning the Notes, as well
as the consequences to them arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances the Issuer may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of the initial

stated interest and principal. For example, the interest rate may step up after the Step-Up Date if certain conditions are
not met. The Issuer intends to take the position that there is no more than a remote chance that it will make such
payments and the Notes should accordingly not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”) or
treated as issued with OID by reason of a step-up in the interest rate for U.S. federal income tax purposes because of
these additional payments. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the
proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. Assuming such position is respected, U.S. Holders would
be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received
or accrued in accordance with their method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully
challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as CPDIs, U.S. Holders could be required to accrue interest income
at a rate higher than the yield to maturity on the Note and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any
gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of the Note. Alternatively, if the Notes are treated as
issued with OID because of the step-up in the interest rate on the Step-Up Date, U.S. Holders would generally be
required to accrue such OID over the term of the Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will
not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments or as issued with OID as a result of the potential step-up in the
interest rate. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to
the Notes of the CPDI rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Initial Stated Interest_**

Each payment of “qualified stated interest” (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts

paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as
ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable at least annually at a qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. Initial stated interest
(i.e., the stated interest rate that applies before any step-up in the rate) on the Notes will be treated as qualified stated
interest.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of initial stated

interest will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment based on the “spot rate” (as such term is defined in

357


-----

Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may recognize
exchange gain or loss when it disposes of any euros it receives (as discussed below under “—Disposition of Euros”).

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of

initial stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued
will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the case of an accrual
period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second
method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot
rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate
on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the interest payment is
actually paid or received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S.
Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual payment or
receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder that receives initial stated interest payment (including a payment attributable

to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), may recognize U.S.
source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received
(translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar
value of the amount of such initial stated interest payment previously accrued during such accrual period, regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss
generally will be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an
adjustment to interest income or expense.

_Foreign Tax Credit_

Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts

paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) and OID (as defined below) will generally
be considered income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally
will be considered passive category income. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at
the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). Recently
issued final U.S. Treasury Regulations (“Final FTC Regulations”) have imposed additional requirements that must
be met for a foreign tax to be creditable (in particular with respect to U.S. Holders that are not entitled to, or do not
elect to apply, the benefits of the Treaty). However, a recent notice from the IRS indicates that the U.S. Department
of the Treasury (“Treasury”) and the IRS are considering proposing amendments to such Treasury Regulations and
allows, subject to certain conditions, taxpayers to defer the application of many aspects of such Treasury Regulations
for taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 and ending before a further date specified by any further
notice or guidance. In lieu of claiming a credit, subject to applicable limitations, a U.S. Holder may be able to take a
deduction for such taxes. An election to deduct creditable foreign taxes instead of claiming foreign tax credits must
be applied to all creditable foreign taxes paid or accrued in the U.S. Holder’s taxable year. The rules relating to the
determination of the foreign tax credit and deductibility of foreign taxes are complex. Prospective investors should
consult their tax advisors concerning the applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of income rules to
income attributable to the Notes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S.

Holders generally will be required to include any such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders will include any OID in income in advance
of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue

price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025

358


-----

multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). U.S.
Holders of the Notes with less than the de minimis amount of discount will include the discount on such Notes in
income, as capital gain, when principal payments are made on the Note.

In the event the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the

sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in
which such U.S. Holder holds such Note (“accrued OID”). Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, a
daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued
in such period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note,
_provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs_
either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period
is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield
to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the
length of such period, over (ii) the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted
issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each
prior accrual period.

For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and

OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating
rate applicable to the Notes as of the issue date.

Regardless of the method of accounting used by a U.S. Holder, OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined

for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative
methods applicable to accrual basis U.S. Holders described above under “—Payments of Initial Stated Interest.”

A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note,

the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the Euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on
the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described
above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than initial stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of
accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second,
as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and
generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Sale, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

On a sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or

loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued
but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as stated interest income as described above to the extent not
previously included in income by a U.S. Holder) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note, in each case
as determined in U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the “U.S. dollar cost” of the Note to such

holder increased by any previously accrued OID and decreased by any cash payments on the Note other than qualified
stated interest. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about how to account for proceeds received on the
sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of Notes that are not paid in U.S. dollars Except as discussed below with
respect to exchange gain or loss on a Note attributable to currency fluctuations, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S.
Holder on a taxable disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S.-source capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year.
In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any long-term capital gain will generally be subject to preferential U.S.
federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Notes.

The gain or loss that a U.S. Holder realizes on the taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to

fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as

359


-----

U.S.-source for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Such exchange gain or loss will generally equal the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of the Note based on the spot rate of exchange
on (i) the date of the disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the
sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to
amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as
discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, a
U.S. Holder will only realize exchange gain or loss upon the disposition of a Note (including any exchange gain or
loss attributable to the principal amount of a Note and any exchange gain or loss attributable to accrued and unpaid
stated interest and accrued OID) to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such holder on the disposition of the
Note. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the proper calculation of exchange gain
or loss realized in connection with their acquisition, sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes.

**_Disposition of Euros_**

Euros received as interest on a Note or upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note

generally will have a tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar value at the time they are received. Any gain or loss recognized
on a sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of the euros (including their use to purchase Notes or upon their
exchange for U.S. dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Satisfaction and Discharge_**

If we were to obtain a discharge of the Indenture within one year of maturity or the redemption date with

respect to all of the Notes then outstanding, as described herein under “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” such discharge would generally be deemed to constitute a taxable exchange of the Notes outstanding for_
other property. In such case, a U.S. Holder would be required to recognize capital gain or loss in connection with such
deemed exchange. In addition, after such deemed exchange, a U.S. Holder might also be required to recognize income
from the property deemed to have been received in such exchange over the remaining life of the transaction in a
manner or amount that is different than if the discharge had not occurred. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
as to the specific consequences arising from a discharge in their particular situations.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under the Treasury Regulations, certain “reportable transactions” (as defined in the regulations) are required

to be reported to the IRS including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Note to the extent that such disposition results in a tax loss in
excess of a threshold amount. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisor to determine the tax
return obligations, if any, with respect to their acquisition, holding sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Foreign Asset Disclosure_**

Individuals (which may include certain entities treated as individuals for the purposes of these rules) that own

“specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or
more than $75,000 at any time during the tax year (or such larger values as specified in the relevant rules) generally
are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an
account at certain financial institutions.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure

requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Back-Up Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of principal and interest (including

the accrual of OID, if any) on, or the proceeds from a sale, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Note, unless

360


-----

the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient, such as a corporation. Additionally, if a U.S. Holder fails to provide its taxpayer
identification number, or in the case of interest payments, fails either to report in full previous dividend and interest
income or to make certain certifications, it may be subject to back-up withholding.

Back-up withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the back-up withholding rules

may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding backup
withholding and information reporting requirements relating to their ownership of the Notes.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations**

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes it is possible that such payments may be

subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by
the Guarantor will be eligible for all the exemptions described above. Holders should consult with their tax advisors
regarding the tax consequences if a Guarantor makes any payments with respect to the Notes.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX

ADVICE. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A
PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR
ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE
INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) entered

into in connection with the Notes, the Issuer has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial
Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to

purchase all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes
which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial
Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery

of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.

After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by
the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their
affiliates.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection

with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other

charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set forth
on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers

against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial
Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to
offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries
that are substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 30 days after the Issue Date.

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales

of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted
by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to
withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have

agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the
meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance
with Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker
dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the commencement of this Offering,
an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule
144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are
restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”)) received by
it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to the Issuer;

362


-----

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done
by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

    - the offering of the Notes has not been registered with the CONSOB pursuant to Italian securities
legislation and, accordingly, that (a) it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or
deliver, directly or indirectly, the Notes, and it has not issued, distributed or published and it will not
issue, distribute or publish, copies of this Offering Memorandum or any other offering circular,
prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other offering material or other information or document
relating to the Issuer, or the Notes, in the Republic of Italy, except: (i) to qualified investors (investitori
_qualificati) as defined by Article 2, paragraph (e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation and any applicable_
provision of the Financial Services Act and the Italian CONSOB regulations; or (ii) in other
circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the EU
Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended
from time to time, and the applicable Italian laws; and (b) any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or
distribution of copies of this Offering Memorandum or any other document relating to the Notes in Italy
under (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above: (i) has been made and will be made by an investment firm, bank or financial
intermediary permitted to conduct such activities in the Republic of Italy in accordance with the
Financial Services Act, CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of February 15, 2018, as amended from time
to time, and the Italian Banking Act; and (ii) has complied with and will comply with it any other
applicable laws and regulations or requirement imposed by CONSOB, the Bank of Italy (including the
reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of the Italian Banking Act and the
implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time) and/or any other relevant
Italian authority.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available

and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor
as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available

and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in

respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are MiFID II appropriate. The target
market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes
in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in

respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
the Notes is eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are UK MiFIR
appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market

-----

assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the

Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly,
and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes
may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules
and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or
a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons
into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose

of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition
would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and
Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to

list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Exchange. We
cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by

applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in
the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial
Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be
liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price, which will be
favorable to you.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified

on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for purposes
of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred
to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers
who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next succeeding business days
will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Stabilizing Manager may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and

penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the
Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders
to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to
cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Stabilizing Manager to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or
dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to
cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market
levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end
these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the
Notes.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advisory, investment management,
principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective

364


-----

affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage in lending, advisory, investment banking, corporate finance
services, commercial banking transactions and/or other commercial dealings with, and may provide services to, us
and our affiliates and/or to the parties directly or indirectly involved in the Offering. Some of the Initial Purchasers
and/or their respective affiliates are (i) bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers and lenders with respect to the
Fiskeby Acquisition Facility which will be refinanced with a portion of the proceeds of the Notes; (ii) bookrunners
and mandated lead arrangers and lenders with respect to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility that we expect will be
cancelled following the issuance of the Notes; and (iii) bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers and lenders with
respect to the Revolving Credit Facility. Those initial purchasers included in (i)-(iii) above have received, and expect
to receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions, certain of which are payable with proceeds from
the issuance of the Notes. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or
their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities
(or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments
or those of our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with
us may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities,
including, potentially, the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes
and would bear the costs deriving from a possible (total or partial) cancellation of the bond hedging swaps. The Initial
Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of the_

_Notes offered hereby._

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any

state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, therefore unless so registered, may not be offered, sold,
pledged, taken up, resold, transferred or delivered, directly or indirectly, in or into the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of such state or other jurisdiction.
Accordingly, the Issuer is offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

(a) in the United States, to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as
defined in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

(b) outside the United States, to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in accordance with
Regulation S (and only to investors who, if resident in a Member State of the EEA, are not retail
investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article
4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation; and
only to investors who, if resident in the United Kingdom, are not retail investors, defined as a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules and regulations made under the FSMA to implement
the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.).

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings given to

them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to

and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes are being offered for resale in a transaction not
involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the
Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and, unless so registered,
may not be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred, except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws pursuant to an
exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with
the conditions for transfer set out in paragraphs (5) and (6) below.

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act), nor acting on its
behalf and that either:

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of these Notes to
it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition of Notes will be for its own
account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) (i) it is a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore

or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum,
which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its
investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers
nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the

laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability
to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration
available under the Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the Securities Act.

original issue date of such Notes, the original issue date of any additional Notes and the last date on
which the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto)
or, in the case of the Regulation S Notes, 40 days after the later of the original issue date of such

first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S), only (i) to
the Issuer or a guarantor (if any); (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared
effective under the Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to

the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule
144A; (iv) to non-U.S. persons pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in
offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other available

and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) above to
require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and other information satisfactory to each
of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer is completed

(7) It understands that the issuance of Additional Notes under the Indenture may have the effect of
extending the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

(8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on
the transfer of such Notes.

(9) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale of the

the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A.

(10) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory

accuracy of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if
any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been
made by your purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer and
the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor
account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and
agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

(12) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the
Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer
or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer
of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under “Plan of Distribution” and
“Notice to Certain European Investors.”

(13) It confirms that it, or the investor account for which it acts, is not an EEA retail investor. For the

implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Article 2 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

Regulation; (iii) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “UK retail investor” (as defined in
paragraph (14) above) in the UK; and (iv) no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**

**SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of any Guarantees and_

_the security interests being provided for the Notes, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in Italy._
_The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all the limitations or_
_considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes or any Guarantees or security interests_
_being provided for the Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect_
_to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union and the United Kingdom**

The Issuer, TopCo and certain Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of member stated

of the European Union are incorporated under the laws of Italy, which is a member state of the European Union (a
“Member State”).

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to

insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions).

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open

insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the
company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its “center
of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and
conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined

for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of
the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed
to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only
apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to
the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests
being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an
EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all
the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of
management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member
state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests
of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its
business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where
they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations.

If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an

EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main
insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency
proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the
Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Insolvency Regulation
are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened
in another Member State.

If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article

3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction
(subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if
such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency
Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding
listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which
are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place

371


-----

of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open
main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.

The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets

of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. If a company does not have an establishment in
any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect
of such company under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in

which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can
only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency
proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated
under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor
whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request the opening
of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori concursus, that
is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening

main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant
EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed
by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on
him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from
that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in
that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency
proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets.

The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the

commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to
facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency

Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication, cooperation and efficiency in the insolvency of several
members of a group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of
the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction
over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings
concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which
has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective
administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict
of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not
incompatible with the rules applicable to them. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating
insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer experiences
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer.

**Italy**

**_Limitations on granting security interests and on enforcement under Italian Law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of

a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws
(statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain

372


-----

other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an
acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

_Corporate benefit_

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must

receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such
company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and
determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and
the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company
on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to
which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration.

While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security

interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually selfevident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee
granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor)
granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in
exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor
may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of
an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may
include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members
of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian
courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be
challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of
security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a

security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict
of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter
of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds
that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose
of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in
the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor
having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including
the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate
benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the
interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream

guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within

the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized
financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail
the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2,
2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the
granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not
qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the
meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity.
As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the
same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

373


-----

_Financial assistance_

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which

would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial
assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by
a third party of its own shares or quotas those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company.
Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares
or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions.
Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors
may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to

guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount.

Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the

guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the
guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum
guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant
Italian guarantor. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s
assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk
that the guarantee could be declared void.

**_Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial assistance,

the maximum amount that any guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (if any) (the “Italian Guarantor”) may
be required to pay in respect of its obligations as guarantor under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents related thereto will be subject to
limitations. By virtue of these limitations, the obligations of a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy under its
Guarantee may be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or such Italian guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

The obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor and/or a

security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set
forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for
the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements
on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required

to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security
documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not
cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any
guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further _pari passu indebtedness_
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of
doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by
an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes,
the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement
regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents
relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative
and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of
the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian

374


-----

Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as
described above.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the

guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited
amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security.

**_Trust_**

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as

representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian
Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests
and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a
representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on
behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the
security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and
enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3,
of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties
to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or
public registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the

appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore
an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security
under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also
in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph
3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and,
therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an
Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor
of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or
cannot enforce that Collateral.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can

be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties
to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust”
or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a
“trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

**_Certain considerations in relation to guarantees and security interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect

creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of
a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management
and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination
powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a _società a_
_responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity_
in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an
excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a
financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to Article 164 of
the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan
within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision
replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to
be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw back

actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations—Judicial Winding-Up
_(liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that,_
Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and
coordination powers vis-à-vis the entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis_à-vis the entities exercising them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of_
judicial winding up of in the year before, are subordinated.

The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such

provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its
shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some

of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as
_società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts

may apply such provisions relating to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian
subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations
of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors.
Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to
recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or

notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created
over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries
may be impaired or restricted.

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in

a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison
to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law
are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These
competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees
are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and

security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by
the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or
avoidance or clawback of (i) Italian bankruptcy law (i.e. Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16[th] 1942, as amended and
supplemented from time to time “ the Italian Bankruptcy Law,”) and/or (ii) Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Italian
Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor
during a certain legally specified period (the “the suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms,
conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian insolvency laws
_considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable_
and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest
or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be
able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor (fideiussione)

apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the
noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general

may be subject to, among others, the following aspects:

    - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

    - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

    - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform
its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the
Italian Civil Code;

    - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian
law concerning statutes of limitations (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim
of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

    - pursuant to Article 1241 and ff. of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

    - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in
its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is
based on reasonable grounds;

    - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria)
and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public
policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal
concepts under Italian law;

    - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive
such judgment might not be held to do so;

    - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

    - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be
subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the
provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

    - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid,
not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save
those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of
intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of
such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

    - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil
Code are satisfied;

377


-----

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is
appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors’
committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the
enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the
relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the
court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value
returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which
the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of
seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend,
moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until
the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or
bankruptcy/judicial liquidation proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the
relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data
_certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a_
document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one
of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance
waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by
Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of
mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company,
which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any
obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under
the Italian Usury Law; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which
does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which,
accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were
started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an
agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not
be enforceable;

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other
parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as
a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditor from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

- in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation of the grantor
of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third

378


-----

party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial liquidation, the pledged
assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as a consequence, the proceeds
would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and,
therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can

be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee,
security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action
(azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of
ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to
be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security,
agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following
findings:

    - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed
for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

    - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions

with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court
procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more
time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include

special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities
nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are
involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular, the

Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the
guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a comprehensive legal
framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a
comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters which came into force on July
15, 2022 (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter, as subsequently amended and
supplemented and including Legislative Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023,
the “Italian Insolvency Code”). Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no.
38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6.

The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt”

(fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial
liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural
framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different restructuring tools and frameworks
(strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a
new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with
creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new crisis settlement procedure
(composizione negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors;
(viii) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning
group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of the new restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione_

379


-----

_della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to early detect a crisis_
with specific criteria to be adopted by companies and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code
aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative

Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on “Amendments to the Business Crisis
and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023” approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian Council
of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on

March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has been
initially postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published
in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law June 5, 2020, no.
40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now effective starting from
July 15, 2022.

Provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of declaration

of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and any filings seeking for the
approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening of a composition
with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e., the effective date of the
Italian Insolvency Code).

Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law in Italy

as it stands now and in particular: (i) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations in
place until July 15, 2022 and (ii) of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry into force.

**Italian Bankruptcy Law—applicable to proceedings filed or opened before July 15, 2022 only**

In particular, please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and

the other ancillary applicable regulations.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the

goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the
sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the

insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or
more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet with ordinary means its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather
than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a
company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be
possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the
company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly
challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione

_del patrimonio described below, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_
law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (Accordi Stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it provides the debtor with

significant advantages and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court
restructuring are vulnerable to being very likely reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and

380


-----

possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger various liabilities in the event of a subsequent
bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing temporary financial difficulties, it may be
possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the
company.

**_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_**

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the

two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree
118/2021 requesting the competent court pursuant to art. 9 of the Italian Insolvency Law, to confirm or modify the
protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures provided for
pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021 on the same day as the publication of the request in the relevant
Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below); and if necessary
to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures” and, together with the Protective Measures, the “Measures”),
and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to
authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,
such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur.

The _composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore_

_commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_
assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow and it is likely
that the financial recovery shall occur, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy
Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law Decree 118/2021, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing
for a composizione negoziata della crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to a concordato preventivo
procedure nor accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti have been previously filed to the court in such respect and (ii) in
the event that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed, may not submit a new request
before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply

to group of companies, in order to provide for the possibility of the negotiated proceeding to take place in a unitary
form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group companies – at the end of the
negotiations – to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 (as set
out below) as a whole group or enter separately as single companies into the solutions referred to therein.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the

filing of a petition for the appointment of a third-party and an independent expert (the “Expert”) which however,
pursuant to Article 23 of the Law Decree 118/2021, is prevented for enterprises having filed to access the procedures,
debt restructuring agreements and/or concordato preventivo, including (i) pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, (ii) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (iii) the
procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of
Law No. 3 of January 27, 2012 (i.e. procedimenti di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione
_del patrimonio) pending such procedures. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as_
Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during
the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties

involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings
close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness,
must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s financial and business situation, on the actions
carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations.

If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the

entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of
commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition.

381


-----

The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have

not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed
situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days (pursuant to Article 5,
Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert
agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the
court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert

issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the
court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which declares the termination of their
related effects.

Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert,

or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The Protective
Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot
obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim
actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the _concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting_
creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the

date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur
cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their

obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their
expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the
missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective
Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he must

simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and
to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be
ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order

of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of
the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days.
The judge, in his or her discretion, may order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration.

Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective

Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose
of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the
creditors that file the relevant request.

Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law Decree 118/2021, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out

acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary
activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way
as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of
the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur
shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the

perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate
notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. When Protective

382


-----

Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such
measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the

extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the
creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior
indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’
financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided
under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the
court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the
parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as

follow:

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes
cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021
if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business
as a going concern for at least 2 years;

(b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the
effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In such case,
the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, shall not be required.

At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt

restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Article 182
_septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law._

Alternatively, the entrepreneur may:

(a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67,
Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio
pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree
118/2021 can be filed only following the end of the negotiations;

(c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the
so-called Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021:

(a) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their
effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition_

with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory
administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for
large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or _concordato semplificato per la_
_liquidazione del patrimonio;_

(b) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the
granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from
claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are
consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of
recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was
made;

(c) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert
accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or
if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021;

(d) payments and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert
assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of
recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to
Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of
certain criminal sanctions provided for pursuant to Article 216 and 217 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law.

**_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by Law Decree_**

**_118/2021)_**

Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition

with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio).

If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been

conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2,
of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the
entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office, a petition for
admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the
documents listed under Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which may
divide the creditors into various classes. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio
is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such
publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply.

The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del

_patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations_
and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights
(cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the
creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case
ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having

been notified of the same.

**_Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di Risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the_**

**_Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared

by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An

384


-----

independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the
truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the
expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements
set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false
certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,

therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring
arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring

the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings
and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against
enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors or any public authority including tax
authorities. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the
payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan,
subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application
of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed
(although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax
benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court prebankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.

**_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

**_(Accordi di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)_**

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt

restructuring agreements, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor
must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the
agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following
terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and
payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which
are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing
financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. The

Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt
restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by
the debtor or by a third-party, or the sale of the business to a third-party, and may contain refinancing agreements,
moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed
tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the

Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication
of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register
and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation
filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the
relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the
conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement
action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor,
and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the
expert must be deposited.

385


-----

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an

application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the
moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of
the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the
agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the

outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

The new Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of

May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments
are made to the plan, inter alia, if any substantial change to the plan are is necessary or required before or after the
homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors, the entrepreneur shall make the appropriate changes
aimed at the implementation of such plan, requesting (i) the independent expert to renew its report as well as (ii) the
creditors involved in such debt restructuring agreement to manifest their consent the necessary amendments.

The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 _septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and_

introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies, thus
anticipating some of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 _novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree_

118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is
reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (therefore implying that the plan must
be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors); (b) does not previously file a petition
for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and
(c) does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt

restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to
the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the
court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called “cram-down”),
provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-participating creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser
extent than the liquidation alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature,
(ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and
(iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected by the proceeding) have been duly
notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring
agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa) and the related documentation. If these conditions are met,
the remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however,
non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it.

Pursuant to Article 11 of The Law Decree 118/2021 the percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of

the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations
pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is

set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt
restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries
which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to nonparticipating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not
contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case, the
rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 _octies_ of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement

(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also

386


-----

bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under
Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the
attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the nonadhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery strategies undertaken by
the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have
been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have
received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the
agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement
within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the

standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations,
the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the
utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree

118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring
agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable
with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed
otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with nonlimited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as
guarantors.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the

approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy
priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but
only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt
restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (finanza ponte) or granted in execution of
the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (finanza in esecuzione) may be granted such priority status provided
that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at
the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the pre-bankruptcy approval of the
composition with creditors.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the

sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation
to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the
debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with
in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having
verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new
financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and

(ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and

due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and
to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional
documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring

agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined
below.

Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the

sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian

387


-----

Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so-called prededucibile) indebtedness,
aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request
of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the
required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the
company.

**_Court Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (Concordato Preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to

insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its
creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby
avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be
made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets _(attivo_
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross_
revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and
(iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the
court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report
assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided
by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register.
From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement
and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo
by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the
creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless
authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the
_concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and

payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least
20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including
through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies
of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the
transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the
division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The
composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition

for a _concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian_
Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree
**69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three**
financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving
the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the
court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible
further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In
advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement
(pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i)
appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor
has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of
assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent
acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato_
_preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The_
statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in
respect of the _concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for_ _concordato preventivo (so-called_
_concordato in bianco)._

388


-----

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years

without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation
of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management
of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring
plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court.
The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following
day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being

declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant
requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out
by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring
plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time
for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with

creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s
authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness

authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant
to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161,
Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the
company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are
treated as super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related
acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arise out
of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors
(domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon
the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company
being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary
petition.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the

debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which
are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the
petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence
of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be
necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to
the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented.
Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of
those assets that are not functional to the business allowed.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to

supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting.
During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies
(usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed
to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions
may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the
debtor, are super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote

of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan
provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The composition with creditors is approved
only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the

389


-----

implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not
express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting
to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the
creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting
and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the
_concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the_ _concordato proceeding, the_
interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes,
the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable
Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies
is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato preventivo_
unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full
satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in
which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve
the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority
of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately
safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo
is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting
class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the _concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant_
creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would
otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for

individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the
aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement
proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal
of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of prebankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured
claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a pre
bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement
proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial
commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going

concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant

special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking
all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended

by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the
debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third-party, the judicial commissioner may request
to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors.
After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting
creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be

authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except
for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements
(rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita
_aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili). The_
request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo

390


-----

or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s
request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just
once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages
suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the
admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the _concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the_

public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company
bankrupt.

**_Impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter alia, on

insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the continuity
of companies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading
on a going concern basis before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency
proceedings already pending during the COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic.

Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree.

According to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and

the ratified debt restructuring agreements provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for
fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti
_omologati based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six months. In the procedures for the_
approval (omologazione) of a _concordato and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di_
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the_
grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato preventivo in
accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article
182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the
term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo
in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities were not reached according
to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/pre-insolvency

scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of
companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the
financial year ended on December 31, 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure, originally
provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178
of December 30, 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic
on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following:
(i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal
liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations.

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings (Fallimento)_**

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial

liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when
a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to
regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent
bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori
_commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an_
aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi
_lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total_
indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

391


-----

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

    - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims
within a defined period;

    - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the
secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured
creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the
sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision;

    - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare);

    - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage
to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to
creditors;

    - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in
certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than
those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

    - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration
are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all

of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy

judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the
creditors and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole.
The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can
take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In
this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the
requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is
shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including
employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under
mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those
commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to
the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment
of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated.

**Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare).** Bankruptcy proceedings can

terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be
filed by one or more creditors, third-parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the
debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before
the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors
are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security
or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their

392


-----

secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of
the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes
(thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner.
The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The _concordato fallimentare proposal must be_
approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are
formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required.

    - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may**
be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be
allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims
originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims
which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured
creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are
paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social
security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order
of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most
circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges
(creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the
proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither
the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims
or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a
hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the
entire bankruptcy’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

###### • Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw back” or
avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, among others, to the revocation of payments
or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key
avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and
transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally
considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in
other jurisdictions.

    - In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one
year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other
transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described
below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law
and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner,
as detailed below.

    - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to**
certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.
Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the
declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a
court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of
law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of
the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the
bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

    - **Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver.**

393


-----

(a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (so-called
“suspect period”), may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article
67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves
that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction
was entered into:

(1) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the
value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the
value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

(2) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

(3) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when
the new security was granted; and

(4) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due
at the time when the new security was granted.

(b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period specified
below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves
that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or
transaction:

(1) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions
entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

(2) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration.

(c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(1) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

(2) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce
the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

(3) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the
Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential
property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family
(within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main
seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency
declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the
commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

(4) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to
a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(5) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of
“concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo
_di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

394


-----

(6) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning
work carried out by them; and

(7) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect
to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt

entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for
by the Italian Civil Code.

Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt

entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor,
provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date
on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the
purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a
third-party, the third-party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on
which the claim was originated, such third-party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely
with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified”

clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to
subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement
proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the
relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g.,
gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale or “family
trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the thirdparty purchaser.

**Italian Insolvency Code**

Please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry

force on July 15, 2022, which supersedes the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the

goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis” procedure
or “Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set of rules, as will
be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of
businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by a

court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public prosecutor
and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Italian Insolvency Code, is defined
as the state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that the debtor is no longer
able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of
insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Italian Insolvency Code also introduced a specific
concept of crisis, which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Italian Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor
such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested by the inadequacy of prospective cash flows to
meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and crisis are factual situations upon the occurrence of
which different instruments provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code may be activated.

In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state of

crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may
safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a
subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

395


-----

The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in

a state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an economic or financial
imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency will occur.

**_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the

debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are
vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable
transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company
is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its
creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

**_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code_**

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa was originally introduced in the Italian

legal framework by Law Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Italian Insolvency Code.
It is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the
entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code requesting the competent court to
confirm or modify the Protective Measures provided for pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code on the
same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the
acceptance of the Expert (as defined below), and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures necessary to complete
the negotiations, and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in line with
the provisions set forth under Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is a proceeding aimed at facilitating the

recovery of companies which “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance such as to
make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the market, including
through the sale of the business or a branch of it.”

According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della

_crisi d’impresa_ can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural
(imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business
and/or their financial situation, such that it is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. It is, therefore, a
procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of the debtor’s situation. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3,
letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata
_per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (i) shall certify that no judicial winding-up proceedings or similar proceedings_
are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to the procedures provided for under Articles 40 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1, letter a) and 54, paragraph 3, have been previously
filed and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is
dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is requested by the entrepreneur, may not submit a new request
before one year has elapsed after dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi

_d’impresa may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It should be_
noted that paragraph 9 of such provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the negotiations—to either
enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code as a group, or
use one of the tools referred to under Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole group.
The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of
a petition for the appointment of a third-party and independent expert to the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber
of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform (the “Expert”). Pending a procedure for over-indebtedness
restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No 3 of 27 January 2012
(i.e., procedimenti di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition
cannot be filed. Pursuant to Article 16 of the Italian Insolvency Code the person who acted as Expert in the context of
such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following
the termination of the negotiated proceeding.

396


-----

The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for

facilitating and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order
to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a
branch thereof.

The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and

his/her own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is
positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome,
the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the
appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete and real chances of
recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally and can be assisted by its advisors.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the

parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic
meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with
fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or
planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must
provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage his/her assets without causing unfair
prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment and/or
transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed manner, and the
access to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa does not, by itself, constitute ground for
withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts.

If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the

entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of
commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered
terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed
by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue
up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties involved
in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact
that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 19 and/or Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency
Code.

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the

Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to
the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of
their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert,

or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures, which may also be
limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. The Protective
Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot
obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim
actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the _concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting_
creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the

date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the composizione negoziata, the ruling of opening
the judicial winding-up proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the declaration of the
insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the court revokes the Protective
Measures.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their

obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their
expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the
missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective

397


-----

Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the publication of the
petition requesting Protective Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must

simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and
to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be
ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order

of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of
the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days,
given that the judge may discretionary order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration.

During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management

of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice
to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations
nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability
of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but
there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors,
subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the

perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate
notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. At the request of
the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert, the Court that has granted the Protective Measures and/or Interim
Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their duration when they do not meet the aim of ensuring
the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in relation to the prejudice caused to the
creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the Protective Measures are revoked,
the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors ceases to be effective for the date on
which the Protective Measure has been revoked.

Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the

extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the
creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior
indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’
financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided
under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the
Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it
considers appropriate, taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to
protect all the interests involved. The court shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness
principle in choosing the purchaser.

Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi

_d’impresa can terminate as follow:_

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes
cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the

398


-----

Italian Insolvency Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the
continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years;

(b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian
Insolvency Code;

(c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the
effects provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such agreement the Expert
acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to be consistent with the
composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur.

At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above-mentioned agreement is executed, the entrepreneur may

alternatively:

(a) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The_
percentage referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code is
reduced to 60% if the achievement of the agreement results from the final report of the Expert.

(b) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56
of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(c) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio
provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(d) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the
so-called Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure;

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code:

(a) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code shall maintain
their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial
liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial
winding-up proceeding (apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan
provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code, a compulsory administrative
winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent
companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified pre-judicial liquidation composition with
creditors agreement aimed at the liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency_
Code;

(b) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the
granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from
claw-back actions pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code if they are
consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of
recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was
made;

(c) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert
accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166
of the Italian Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register
pursuant to Article 21, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has
denied its authorization pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

399


-----

(d) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses
to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery
(risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22
of the Italian Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain
criminal sanctions.

**_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_**

Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial

liquidation composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio)._

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_

proceeding, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur has not been
able to reach an agreement with its creditors) but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith and that
the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible,
within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court where
the entrepreneur has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the _concordato semplificato per la_
_liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of the Italian_
Insolvency Code. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the
companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects
provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency Code are produced.

Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, inter

_alia, express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of the_
auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list filed by the
debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione). Creditors and any third-party
which has any interests are entitled to object to the court approval (omologazione) within ten days before the date
fixed for the hearing.

If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with

priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the
creditors with respect to the alternative of a judicial winding-up liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a benefit
to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also appoint a
liquidator.

The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del

_patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations_
and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights
(cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the
creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case
ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. With the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having

been notified of the same.

Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a

pre-identified third-party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such
third-party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better solutions
on the market, may implement the offer.

**_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian_**

**_Insolvency Code_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento)

addressed to the creditors and prepared by debtors who are either insolvent or in a state of crisis, in order to restructure
their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly
by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei Revisori Contabili) must
verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There
is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent expert. The independent expert must possess certain
specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian
Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of

judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority.
Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific
majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring the

debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the possibility to adopt such tools to liquidate
the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the
rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement
proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection
against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code
provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or
security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain
conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided
for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of
the Italian Insolvency Code; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither
ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the
Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the independent expert and the arrangements is possible upon a debtor’s
request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are
lower than in case of an in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the
reorganization plan (or the agreements entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial
review, it cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent
judicial winding-up, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it
was certified by the independent expert.

Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, Italian Insolvency Law sets forth specific rules regarding Out-of-court

reorganization plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors, which must be followed
for the plans and agreements to grant protection against claw-back actions and potential civil and criminal
responsibilities. More in detail, out-of-court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency
Code must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the debtor
and which also needs to indicate, among others, the causes of the crisis and the new resources which will be made
available to the debtor and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the
restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position and, in case of its failure and
subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as being unreasonable.

**_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57_**

**_of the Italian Insolvency Code_**

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for pursuant to

Article 57 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code may be entered into by the debtor with creditors holding at least 60%
of the outstanding indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the competent court. An independent expert
appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and
declare and that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the indebtedness vis-à-vis nonparticipating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120-day term from: (i) the date of

401


-----

sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the nonparticipating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the
court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the
non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the
court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, only a debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis
(as described above) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication.

Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the
agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the court will validate
(omologare) the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its publication pursuant to
Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the

debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third-party carrying
out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or
postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial
or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets the rule for when
substantial amendments are made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial amendments to the plan
before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt restructuring agreement expressed by
creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of substantial amendment. In the event of
substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor shall make such amendments as are appropriate to ensure the
implementation of the agreements, by requesting the update of the certified report issued by the expert having the
requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified
report, together with the amended restructuring plan, shall be published in the companies’ register, giving appropriate
notice to the creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC). The parties may file an objection (opposizione)
to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

**_The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_**

With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement (or at any time pending

the procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any Measures (e.g., a stay of actions or the creation by creditors
of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in relation to pre-existing debts, etc.). Such
Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, to the court by
the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for approval of the agreement),
subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition
for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. According to Article 54,
paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval of the debt restructuring agreement
includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is
prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any
initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a debt restructuring
agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case
petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties who
filed such petitions. It is a court-supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the
duration of the proceedings is generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring
agreement are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their
interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid
within 120 days from validation (omologa) of the debt restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and
payable at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity date if such creditors’ claims are not yet due as
of the validation date of such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively Article 57, paragraph 3 letters a) and
b).

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a

hearing to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such deadline, creditors

402


-----

and other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing, the court decides upon any
opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met.

Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring

agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same
category (with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request the court to declare
that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”).

More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia

_estesa)_ provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code-which were previously only permitted in
relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total
indebtedness - can now be applied to any category of creditors, provided that, inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging
to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in
good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial
situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of
the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims
of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75% of all the claims belonging to the same
category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of the agreement are
extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the amount they would receive with the
judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more than one category; and (v) the debtor
has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to
be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the
Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the _composizione negoziata per la_
_soluzione della crisi d’impresa._

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special provision is

set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt
restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries
which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to nonparticipating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not
contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case the
rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione

_di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the_
non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article
62, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code has been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business
data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that
the treatment reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the context of a judicial
winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have
been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have
received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the
agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement
within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code and

standstill agreements provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose on the non-adhering
creditors, inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the
possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities.

Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so-called facilitated debt restructuring

agreement (“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt restructuring
agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead of
the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code) provided that the debtor: (i)
has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for a period of 120

403


-----

days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary”
restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously requested to the court the granting of protective interim measures
on the its assets.

By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the

creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims
towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by
way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards
the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have
granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and

to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on a going

concern basis:

    - the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due under a
loan agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the business,
provided that: (a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the composition with
creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the payment of the debt for
principal and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 52,
paragraph 3, of the Italian Insolvency Code certifies (i) that such payments are essential for the
continuation of the business activity and functional to ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as
already required by Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code) and, (ii) that the secured claims can be
fully satisfied with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the
repayment of the installments due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors;

    - the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of the
application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose
continuation is envisaged under the plan.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the approval

(omologa), the court, upon the debtor’s petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial winding-up procedure. If the
revocation results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of the obligations arising under
the debt restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be proposed by creditors or by the public
prosecutor. In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional time to the debtor aimed at supplementing the
documentation and shall act in accordance with Article 270 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

**_Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared

insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order
to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and
the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made
by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in
an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi
_lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total_
indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor can file a petition with the court
for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the debtor’s main office. The debtor must file the
petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan containing an analytic description of manner and timing of
the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal
and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for _concordato_
_preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated to_
the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the _concordato_

404


-----

_preventivo, preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages_
registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in
the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the
Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for the admission to the _concordato_ proceedings includes the
relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited
to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives
prohibited under the relevant Measures). As already described with reference to debt restructuring agreements, at any
time pending the proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted Measures, which can also be requested pursuant
to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools
provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and

payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least
20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to
creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares),
or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the
debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes (which is mandatory in
certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Italian Insolvency Code), provided that each class is composed of
creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different treatment of creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or
deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions provided for under Article 109 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency Code has provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a
going concern basis (concordato con continuità), the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which
may extend up to six months from the date of sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors proposal for
the payment of secured creditors (creditori privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e.
employees, professionals etc.).

Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the

unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a
composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold
in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the relevant filing for such proceeding, external
resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of such filing by at least 10% and (ii) the
degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims.
In this respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal
with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under
Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20% requirement
set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as “external” when provided for any reason by the debtor’s
shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination, in relation to which the plan provides them to be for
the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the
continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains

management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the deputy
judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the _concordato_
_preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary transactions_
require the prior written approval of the court. Provided that the abovementioned steps are taken, during this time, all
enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand,
are stayed. The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens
or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages
registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in
the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. Any act, payment or security executed or
created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is
exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles
322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in
relation to acts and payments made in execution of the composition with creditors and/or in relation to finance

provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully
carried out by the distressed company have super senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial
winding-up (see “Statutory priorities” below).

For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the paragraph relating to debt restructuring

agreements.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and

simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Italian Insolvency
Code, the simplified petition may be _utilized_ by the debtor also to access a debt restructuring agreement or a
restructuring plan subject to approval by the court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a
_concordato. The debtor company may file such petition, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal_
and all relevant documentation (or the debt restructuring agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a period assigned
by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one
possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi)
or in the event where filings for a judicial winding-up proceeding are not pending. If the court accepts such preliminary
petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the
company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 106 of the Italian
Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent
liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may
reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the_
company during the abovementioned period. As mentioned above, filing the simplified petition, the debtor may
request the application of Measures.

Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term for

the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application
and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term
established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is
published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible and,

upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the
adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities carried out by the debtor company
appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full” application, the court may, ex officio, after hearing
the debtor and if appointed the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following
the filing of the simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed
company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out
acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out
by the distressed company after the filing of the concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) have
super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent judicial winding-up.

The concordato preventivo proposal may also provide, inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business by the

debtor as going concern; or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con continuità
_aziendale) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets that are no longer_
necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to Article 84, paragraph 3
of the Italian Insolvency Code, the concordato misto qualifies as a concordato con continuità aziendale, regardless
the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases, the plan and the petition for the
_concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation_
of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report
of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of
creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Existing contracts, even
if entered with governmental bodies, are automatically not to be terminated by admission to procedure.

406


-----

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the

winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain
a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Under Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a concordato pursuant to Articles 44

and 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay prefiling claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they are essential for
business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to

supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific period
of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the company
generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the
appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business).

Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes an

offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third-party, the
court or the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to acquire
competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge, by
decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph 4, the
judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers, providing that in all
cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements for the participation of the
bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on their use, (e) the manner in which
the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f) the manner in which the competitive
procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the consideration to be provided by the subsequent offers,
(h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the forms of publicity, and (l) the date of the hearing for the evaluation
of the bids if the sale takes place before the court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a
person other than the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their obligations
towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of
the competitive proceeding.

The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and must be approved

with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in
the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the majority of the receivables admitted to vote is
reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case one
creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is also necessary to reach majority by
headcount. The concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor
of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the _concordato_
_preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions_
between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable
majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law
provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely
untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted
by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant
quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of
_concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that_
they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an
independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal.
Among others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the
entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been
perfected during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting.
The court may approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected
to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering
creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with
the judicial liquidation). If an objection to the implementation of the _concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the_
creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a non-adhering class, entitled to

407


-----

vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are
likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the _concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case_
(including the judicial winding-up).

The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the

social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is
decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to a judicial
liquidation scenario.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for creditors

(except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10%
of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a court supervised composition with
creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the
proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari),
considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the debtor has filed for a composizione negoziata
provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency

Code, the composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), is approved if all the
creditors’ classes vote in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement. In each class, the relevant composition
with creditors’ proposal is approved if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if twothirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least half of the
total claims of the same class have voted. In case of non-approval, Article 112, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency
Code shall apply. In this respect, it should be noted that secured creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in
cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa) of the concordato con continuità and provided that the
security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the winding-up, functional to their satisfaction. In
case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the delay is
reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court.

Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the concordato

preventivo proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20% or more
of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case,
the court has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems
that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial winding-up scenario.
After the creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and appoints one or more liquidators
in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special
powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all
corporate actions required.

Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato

preventivo, the delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the
appropriate conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time,

by the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and normally continue pending
the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements
(contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with
the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors’ plan, except for certain agreements which are
excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato),
residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso
_abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the_
competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the _concordato preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice

408


-----

_delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending_
agreements can also be suspended for a period of time (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the
preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable
grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are
pending, renewable just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted,
the suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days
from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the
other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of
the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the concordato preventivo
procedure.

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition

with creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the _concordato can be terminated or_
annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial winding-up may follow, at
the behest of the relevant court. if the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of payments
are amended as per the concordato proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the
company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of
the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors
and guarantors of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the _concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial_

commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within one
year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the _concordato_ itself. The
_concordato_ may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in case a
portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The relevant
lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in any event,
within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato
itself.

**_Available financing forms under the Italian Insolvency Code_**

The enactment of the Italian Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal

framework set out in the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going concern
and maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the Italian
Insolvency Code.

However, the new provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies some

debated issues.

In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of creditors

already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims were reduced due
to the potential considerable increase in predeductible claims and, to this extent, granted a preeminent role to the
independent expert together with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former legal framework, the new
provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code focus more on preserving the business value of the distressed company as a
going concern by strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the context of the relevant proceedings.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and

to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo).

The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Italian Insolvency

Code are set out below.

409


-----

**_Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 Italian Insolvency Code_**

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring

transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a view
of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the Italian
Insolvency Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors procedure described below) may
authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such
indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims,
provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise
obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice
to the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall
financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are functional
to the continuity of the business activities until the sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency proceedings or
to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a better satisfaction of
the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes that there is the urgent need
to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of the subsequent admission of the
debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the
super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the petition or the expert report contain false data or omit
important information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the
judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances
at the date of the disbursement.

**_Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 Italian Insolvency Code_**

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related

claims) granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of
a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (finanza
_ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99, paragraphs 1_
and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is
expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. The indebtedness under such financing option
may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims.

**_Implementation financing - Article 101 Italian Insolvency Code_**

In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code,

any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-judicial
liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided for in the relevant
plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial liquidation, save for the below
(such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing, unless the lender
has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement or of the supervised
pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors, as in such case the priority status is afforded to 100% of the financing)
according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent
admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings
do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring
agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false
data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai
_creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of_
such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

410


-----

**_The shareholders’ financing – Art. 102 Italian Insolvency Code_**

Pursuant to Art. 102, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies to

any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting counterindemnities) up to 80% of their amount.

Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made

available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a composition with
creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit of super senior ranking
status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in Paragraph 1 does not apply.

**_Super senior ranking - Art. 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 Corporate Crisis and Insolvency Code_**

Super senior ranking (prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings, interim

financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above.

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly

qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super
senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings (including
in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings).

As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts

of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements).

Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the

one side and for the implementation financings on the other side.

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information

are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the
independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in plan
underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency

Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court
in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super senior
ranking when it is proved (jointly) that:

    - the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when
the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and

    - the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the
aforementioned circumstances.

With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph 2

of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of
the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively):

    - when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the
proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement turns out
to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or

    - when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders
providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment of the
financings.

411


-----

**_Restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_**

An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the Italian

Insolvency Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto
_ad omologazione) (the so-called “PRO”, the rules of which are set out in the new Articles 64-bis and 64-ter of the_
Italian Insolvency Code).

This new tool takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of regular

insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it should be noted
that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its creditors by
dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This instrument allows
the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of “par condicio creditorum” (i.e., the equal
treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous consent of the classes. A judgement of
admissibility is provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the
correctness of the class formation criteria.

Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common

framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e., _concordato preventivo, debt restructuring_
agreement and also to judicial winding-up). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano
_di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its approval, is_
based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary
management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the court commissioner.
The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the proposal of composition
(concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an
application for composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring
plan provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if a
majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors
have voted in favour, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. The
court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor objects to the
proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser
extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of convenience in
its observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was due to a
cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione
_soggetto ad omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility_
phase, providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be
effectively approved.

Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation

(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of appeal
within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.

**_Court-supervised composition for small debtors_**

The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does

not meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools.

Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the

involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the debtor in
preparing the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a _concordato_
_preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner._

**_Judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale)_**

The judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an

insolvent company’s assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the company’s liquidation.

412


-----

Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults and/or external
elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due.

The judicial winding-up is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial enterprises

(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had_
gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years;
and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Pursuant to Article 37 of the
Italian Insolvency Code, the request to commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed
by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have control and supervisory
functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s creditors and (iv) in certain cases, by the public
prosecutor.

Upon the commencement of judicial winding-up proceedings, amongst other things:

    - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed, and creditors must file claims within a
defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the
secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims are paid out of
the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured
creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge
(giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge
decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

    - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the
secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors
may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore)
and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant
timing in his or her decision;

    - the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or
received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties that have
been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the creditors of the debtor
(Article 145 of Italian Insolvency Code);

    - the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are
transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant
or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency Code). The judicial receiver
is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all pending
proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the adjudication is
issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the judicial receiver;

    - the beginning of the judicial winding-up involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with
a view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the court if the
continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the competent court
authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa), the management of the
business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail himself of qualified third parties for
this purpose);

    - certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain
period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial winding-up procedure (varying from six months to

413


-----

two years) can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met (provided for pursuant to Article
166 of the Italian Insolvency Code);

    - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in
certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than
those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

    - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency declaration
are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the
judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations
have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided
for the Italian Insolvency Code.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a

written petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days; within
such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the
deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed
terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all
of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by
the Italian Insolvency Code.

Judicial winding-up proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy Law,

are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’
committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors and is responsible for
the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are
distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of
time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property.

Furthermore, the parties of a judicial winding-up proceeding as well as any interested party, may file an

appeal (opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after having been notified
of the same.

    - **_Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale)._** Pursuant
to Article 240 of the Italian Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings can terminate prior to the
actual judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the debtor, through a proposal for a composition
with creditors in judicial liquidation. By way of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the
context of a judicial liquidation proceeding (i) replaced the former proceeding defined as “concordato
_fallimentare”, a composition with creditors agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy_
proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided for under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and (ii) should be kept distinct from the concordato preventivo, which is an independent insolvency
proceeding. This particular composition with creditor agreement arrangement benefits in a certain way
both the debtor as well as the creditors, in fact while the former is released of the debts falling into the
relevant plan also regaining free disposal of his assets, the latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent
than they would have been with the full completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining to the
debtor’s assets.

    - The creditor, a third-party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a “plan” to
satisfy creditors, including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the _concordato nella_
_liquidazione giudiziale is proposed by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia, (i) shall be filed after 1 year_
from the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding and (ii) shall provide for the contribution by the
debtor of resources that increase the value of the debtor’s assets by at least 10%.

    - Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and
finally by the court. In case the court’s decree approving the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale
becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed and terminated,

414


-----

initiating the enactment phase of the _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. In the context of a_
_concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, the competent court supervises both the proposal and execution_
phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once the liquidation is closed, loses his management
functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions of the
arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with the aforementioned _concordato nella_
_liquidazione giudiziale._

Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide for:

    - the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and economic interests.
Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided two criteria for
the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g., unsecured or preferential and
(b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the Italian Insolvency Code requires for the
criteria and rationale for the division into classes to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted
use of class formation, put in place for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned
proposal;

    - differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of such
differences;

    - the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of claims in any
form possible, by way of example:

    - by assignment of assets; by assumption (accollo);

    - by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to
companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible into
shares or other financial instruments and debt securities.

It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is the option to provide

that secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for the plan to provide for their satisfaction
to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant
proceeds in the event of a judicial liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights
over which the cause of pre-emption exists.

The concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the

creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the
claims in the majority of the classes). However, in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a cram-down
may occur (i.e., in case the court decides to approve the concordato - despite a creditor belonging to a dissenting class
contests the appropriateness of the proposal - if it finds that the claims can be satisfied by the concordato to a nonlesser extent than the practicable alternatives). Final court confirmation and sanctioning (omologazione) is also
required.

Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale

is mandatory:

    - for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and

    - for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the
guarantees or the security interests given in the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale by third parties
do not extend.

With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree (decreto di

_omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed within 30_
days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis” and enjoys the renewed availability of its assets.

415


-----

    - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency Code may**
be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for
payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs
related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (ii) for payment
of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured
creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are
paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, _inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally_
acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and
social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in
order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in
most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges
(creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the
proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither
the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims
or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence
it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual
arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent they are
inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be
adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or part
thereof, or from a single asset.

In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly qualified

as “prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are “prededucibili”:

(i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement body;

(ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a restructuring
plan subject to homologation, the debt restructuring agreements and for the application for
protective measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided that the
abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated;

(iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised
composition with creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the plan
accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided that the
proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the debtor’s
assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from the professional
services required by the related bodies.

    - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code is the equal**
treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory priorities or
security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A
consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the judicial receiver is strictly
regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous year (or, in certain cases,
over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as preferential.

Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that

may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior
to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below
market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under
Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial winding-up compared to the
rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

416


-----

In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw
back period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain
other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back
period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between
acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request
of the judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

    - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to**
certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the
judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency
proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian
Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration
(trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the
ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the
registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of
opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the
application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding or in the prior two-year period; and
(B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a
judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the
winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

    - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The following**
acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati)
vis-à-vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code and be declared
ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the
debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

(i) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the obligations
undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or
promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or by other
customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by the opening
of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts which
were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure pre-existing debts
which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted.

Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions and/or

granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (event those of third-parties) may be
clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other party knew of the debtor’s
state of insolvency and if made by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of the judicial
liquidation or during the prior six months.

The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice;

417


-----

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the
entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, in force as the date of this offering memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a
residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family
(within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of
the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity
is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been
carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s goods,
provided that they concern the implementation of a piano attestato di risanamento (see “Out-of-court
_reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Articles 56 or 284 of the Italian_
_Insolvency Code” above);_

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the context of
a court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of a restructuring plan
subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) provided for pursuant
to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code or of sanctioned debt restructuring agreements with
creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into,
payments made and security interests legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the
application for a concordato preventivo or of an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see above);

(vi) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by
them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see below under
“pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza della società)”) or to other insolvency procedures provided for pursuant to the Italian_
Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating claw-back action

proceedings is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier, five years from the act
or transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted
to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period
is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver
can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five
years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. In this respect, under Article 2901 of the Italian
Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such
creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor was aware of such
prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such
transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor for the purpose of prejudicing the creditors) and that, in the
case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice
(and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person
participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group

transactions. Under Article 290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intra-group claw-back
actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the
creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for judicial winding-up declaration.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified”

claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim
to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement

418


-----

proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the
relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g.,
gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family
trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the thirdparty purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

- **_Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures. One of the main novelties_**
included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational, administrative and
accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code,
required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking
of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an
appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of
timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of suitable initiatives to overcome
the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording,
nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise
description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the
definition and especially for the identification of “adequate structures.”

In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes

to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection of
the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated
that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed
to be adequate should make it possible to:

(i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

(ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for the
next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian
Insolvency Code; and

(iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test for
the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of

the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter alia, as follows:

(i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total monthly
payroll amount;

(ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount greater
than the amount of receivables that are not past due;

(iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due for
more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at least 60
days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures; and

(iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25-novies
of the Italian Insolvency Code.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Amministrazione Straordinaria delle_**

**_Grandi Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_**

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial

enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must be
insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the
previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets
as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last
financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public
prosecutor. The same rules set forth for judicial winding-up proceedings with respect to existing contracts and
creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those
credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary
administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase.

Judicial Phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria

and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers
(commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or
reorganization. The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the
Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the
company to the procedure or place it into judicial winding-up.

Administrative Phase. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the

administrative phase begins, and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring
plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by
the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery
within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with
creditors (concordato preventivo). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the
extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on
the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon
successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company
will be declared insolvent.

**_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (Ristrutturazione Industriale di Grandi Imprese_**

**_in Stato di Insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law

No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano
procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent,
the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at

least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those
from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following
the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses
whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the
company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a

Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed
within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved
by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open judicial winding-up proceedings.

**_Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (Liquidazione Coatta Amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), provided for pursuant to

Article 293 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code, is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled
companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up
pursuant to judicial liquidation proceedings, save for a different indication under Italian law. It is irrelevant whether
these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special
insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the court but by the relevant administrative authority that
oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the
relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of
Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable
legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario

_liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the Bank of Italy or_
the Ministry of Economic Development, which are competent for the filing of an application for a declaration of
insolvency with the subsequent opening of the compulsory administrative winding-up proceeding). The liquidator’s
actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated
judge and the court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under
this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under insolvency
proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for insolvency
proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative
winding-up.

**_Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi_**

**_e dell’insolvenza della società)_**

In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120-bis

and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-judicial
liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza). Among other things, pursuant
to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful restructuring, the plan
may provide for “any modification of the articles of association of the debtor company, including capital increases
and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other modifications that directly affect
the shareholders’ participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and transformations.” Shareholders, who may
no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from hindering the restructuring or even one of its stages.
For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while
retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation and the progress of the restructuring process, may not
remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light
of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors’
removal, the filing for access to the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis,_
paragraph 5, shareholders representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing
proposal.

The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders

to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan. The
formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the shareholders’
participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital. In this context,
special conditions for approval of the arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of the Italian Insolvency
Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that
creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a
participation in the company with a certain value.

Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order

to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision
expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring tool,

-----

by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in relation to
any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not require any
discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from the
implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza)
shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any agreement entered into by the
debtor with third parties.

Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group

to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) aiming
at unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits available to the receiver; and (iii)
subordination of claims.

**_Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In a judicial winding-up proceeding, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to

two years (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that
certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of
five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency

proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future
security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other
creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back (revocatoria) provided
for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of
transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i)
transactions made by the debtor within the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, at below market value (i.e., to the
extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by
the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to
pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless
the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was
entered into, (ii) security granted during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts due
and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time
the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or
security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to
the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation,
if the judicial receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation
is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170,
paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such
petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s
Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider.
If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests
under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the
insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited

exceptions, all transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered
into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure
or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which
is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation
of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to
wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the
registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
(A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial

422


-----

liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of
the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency declaration or in the prior two-year period; and B) payments made by
the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after
the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the

various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and

substantially all of their assets are located in Germany (such Guarantors, the “German Guarantors”). Consequently,
in the event of insolvency of such German Guarantor, subject to the information presented in “European Union and
the United Kingdom” any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings
would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in
Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not organized under German law (for
example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the
German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions.

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code

(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of the United States
or other jurisdictions including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as
well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings,
and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising
under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court

_ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Antrag_
_auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated_
by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that, according to German case law, the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its
debts as and when they fall due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks.

A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values)

unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend
_wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve months (positive Fortführungsprognose)._

A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debt when they fall due. In addition, only the

debtor, but not the creditors, may file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity
(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), which exists if for the company currently is able to service its payments obligations,
but will presumably (predominant likelihood) not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain
prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, the implanting illiquidity does not give rise to
an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft),

a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an
individual as a personally liable shareholder or partner gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the
managing director(s) or under certain circumstances the shareholders of such company must file a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay; however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three
weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of over-indebtedness at the latest six weeks after over-indebtedness
occurred. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event
that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law._

423


-----

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung),

if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turnaround plan to be implemented by way
of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key
aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity
and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless from a
third-party perspective there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of
the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures
(other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor
from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period of either preliminary debtor-in-possession
proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung) or the preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor
must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency

court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims
against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in possession-proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the

court will generally only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management
of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the
court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property
and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.
Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor
may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary
custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger

_Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_
requirements:

    - a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is overindebted);

    - sales revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding
the filing; and/or

    - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis.

The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other

group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions taken
during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the
selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter), orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and the
appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided
of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency
proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal
insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such
advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

424


-----

Upon the opening of the formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is

usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless debtorin-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to
administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator
with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency
administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change
requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the
proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder,
_i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial_
indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the
debtor. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to
any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

For the holders of the Notes, the relevant consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings

against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

    - unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and
dispose of assets of a German subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

    - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by
management of a German subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings
are null and void by operation of law;

    - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of a
German subsidiary of the Issuer’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such
security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings;

    - claims against German subsidiaries of the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance with the
rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

    - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency

petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling

one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying
the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid
if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht
_des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to_
agreements that are not governed by German law. Also, powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain
other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts
become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), _i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not_

constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation
must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

425


-----

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the

insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to assert
claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action
(Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors other than creditors with preferred claims
(Absonderung der Masseverbindlichkeiten) is in principle subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency
proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is
filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the
insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets
are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests,
but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the
insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security.
Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security
granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security.

The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its

possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte)) as well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement
proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and
(ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross
enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant
collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs
of the insolvency proceedings (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate
(Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of
formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency
claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and
to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement
proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and
the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules.

Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan.

However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by
the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor
are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be
effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case
law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the
pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency
administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. Even if the
law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor
retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the
enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the creditor holding a security
interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to
the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as
described above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential
unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the
holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security
over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of
creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders
of the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Guarantees granted by the German
Guarantors after satisfaction of such secured creditors.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the

insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator,
however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before
an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement

426


-----

proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in
accordance with specific majority rules.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies

in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has
to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a
consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims
of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently a new insolvency law on group of companies
has entered into force on April 21, 2018 to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung
_der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), mainly intended to provide for a better coordination of and cooperation_
between insolvency proceedings of group companies. It does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency
proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies
or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single
court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the
appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain
coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and
(iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a
“coordination insolvency administrator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan”
(Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited

to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a
consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of
insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under “—
_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.”_

**_Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and other Security_**

The granting of guarantees and of any other security by German subsidiary guarantors is subject to certain

limitations under German law.

Any guarantee or other security granted by a German Guarantor incorporated in the form of a limited liability

company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”) is subject to certain provision of the Limited Liability
Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbHG”). These provisions would
also apply to any future Guarantor in the form of a GmbH, or in case of a private limited partnership with a limited
liability company as general partner (Kommanditgesellschaft) (“GmbH & Co. KG”) to its general partner.

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing

its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in
accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities
and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its
stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any other security granted by a
GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements
under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from
personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents
to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a
GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security
interest agree, subject to certain exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or security interest against the German
subsidiary (or retain the proceed of an enforcement of the security interests) only to the extent that such enforcement
would not result in the GmbH’s, or KGs general partner that is a GmbH, net assets falling below, or increasing an
existing shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject
to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and Guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect)
subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH (incorporated or established in Germany) will contain such

427


-----

limitation language in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or
security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all.

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court

(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation
where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own
payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest
granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized
in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof), _inter alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of_
contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will
only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out
that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German
Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the
grantor of the subsidiary guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were
to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the
legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction
was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or
had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case

law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the
form of a GmbH or of a limited partnership, the general partner or general partners of which is or are a GmbH
incorporated or established in Germany, which can negatively affect the ability of German (direct or indirect)
subsidiaries of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes, of the subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of
the secured parties to enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees.

Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the

Issuer should, as of today, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor, the
enforcement of the Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded, according
to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions (höchstrichterliche
_Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice_
(Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an affiliated
company within the meaning of Section 15 the Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) of such guarantor and/or security
grantor (other than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of
the enforcement of such guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s
managing directors pursuant to section 15b paragraph 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German

Guarantor incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a
general partner (Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung)
or (ii) an entrepreneurs company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation to
such general partner (Komplementär).

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the

pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische
_Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured_
claim. Accessory security interests will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or
novated, and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the
relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the
security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to
the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.”
Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts

428


-----

payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”). The
pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the
Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The
Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the
security providers under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of
the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the
Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will
have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the security providers for the full principal amount
of the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the
pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts
will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In
addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement

of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting
the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice
requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security
Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing
the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders
priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting
the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by
other creditors).

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a company, which would be based on and governed

by the insolvency laws of Germany, the security interests granted as well as a guarantee provided by that entity could
be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance as
set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which are

deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings, subject to specific periods. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of
the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to challenge
transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing
of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Guarantees or the security were
avoided, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of
their original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received by
the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security interest. In such case, you may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Guarantees or the security. If payments have already been made under the Guarantees or in respect
of security, the insolvency administrator or custodian may require the recipients return the payment to the insolvency
estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Guarantees without preference in
insolvency proceedings (unless and to the extent the security would not be subject to voidness in which case such
claim would be secured to that extent).

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the

provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be challenged according to the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain,
security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was
illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity
(or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii)
after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor had knowledge

429


-----

of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested
such illiquidity or filing);

- any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain
security (or guarantees) (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was
not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor
was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if such act was taken (i) during the last month prior to
the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) during the
second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii)
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the
other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such
detrimental effect);

- any transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or
by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against
a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to
the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time
of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (ii)
after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such
transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;

- any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants
security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;

- any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the
intent to prejudice its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary
had knowledge of such intention at the time of such act. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor,
or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to
four years. “Knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the
beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the
relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. In case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a
creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was
entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor
was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other
creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred
payments shall establish the rebuttable presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid
at this time;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded more
than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no
knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term
“related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board,
shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor,
and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons;

- any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically equivalent claim if (i) in case of the
provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the

430


-----

opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction,
the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder
loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not
engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the
first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of
restructuring the debtor; and

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically
equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate
the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which

the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debt generally as they fell due, that a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the
insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is in particular deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention
to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it was aware of the debtor’s actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or
impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors,
provided that, if the relevant act by the debtor consisted of a settlement on an obligation or the grant of a security
which was due to be paid or granted, as the case may be, then the knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the
insolvency creditors is only presumed if the other party was aware of the actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of
the debtor and of the fact that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party,” there
is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from transactions that
have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an

enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of
execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the
granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance
under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises
its rights of avoidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor

or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending)
insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided
or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this
could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of
the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention
could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the
grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with
respect thereto. Furthermore, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a
security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows
about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral
by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply
this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees and/or security interests to be granted by the German
Guarantors.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to

ensure that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial distress
to solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European
Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and

431


-----

disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and
discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring Directive”)). The
Preventive Restructuring Directive sets out minimum standards to be applied by the Member States (i.e., minimum
harmonization). Although certain features of the Preventive Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into
national legislation, the Preventive Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the
implementation of certain other features.

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development

of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of
the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (“Company
**Stabilization and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court**
restructurings in Germany, before an insolvency procedure on the basis of a restructuring plan prepared by the
company in financial crisis. Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring
**Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent**
restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens).

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the

occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor
will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor’s
management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore,
the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above
under “—Insolvency”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not

necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities,
only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes or the Guarantees), or only selected liabilities.
In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under
the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept
to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices
despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring
Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the
ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene
_Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective_
application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering
of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency”).

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of

a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates
or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral
granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister companies. A
restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required
majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the
restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the
plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of
share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is
formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not
approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan
(cross-class cram-down).

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor

so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a
stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization
order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for
a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum
of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

432


-----

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the

Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries would be the following, having
its center of main interest in German:

    - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only
limited review or supervision by a court;

    - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of
up to eight months due to a stabilization order;

    - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the
restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral
and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security
right);

    - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring
Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

    - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the
Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in

any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings) However, this does not apply to
plans in non-public restructuring matter under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act as they are not
mentioned in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. Expect for public restructuring matters, the
recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private
law.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the

debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking
below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their
amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency
creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency
creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative
fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay
money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for restitution of a
shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan, unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company
have granted the respective loan or legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such loan.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Considerations_**

Subject to the limitations described under “—European Union,” where a company incorporated in The

Netherlands or elsewhere has its “center of main interests” or an “establishment” in The Netherlands, it may be
subjected to Dutch insolvency proceedings. This is particularly relevant for Fineska B.V., Eska International B.V.,
Eska USA B.V. and Eska B.V., which each have its corporate seat (statutaire zetel) in The Netherlands, and are
therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have its “center of main interests” in The Netherlands. Dutch
insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it

433


-----

more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or
bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction.

The following is an outline of certain aspects of Dutch law and practice relating to insolvency laws. This is

not a complete summary of currently applicable Dutch law or practice, and should not be treated as a substitute for
professional advice. Prospective holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to any matter described in this Offering
Memorandum should consult their own professional advisors.

**_General_**

There are three applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations: (a)

suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts
and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, (b) statutory composition proceedings, which is also intended to
facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern and (c) bankruptcy
(faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. In practice a
suspension of payments can result in the bankruptcy of the debtor. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out
below.

**_Suspension of Payments_**

An application for a suspension of payments (“moratorium”) can only be made by the debtor itself, if it

foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is
filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more
administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of
payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of
payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension
of payments.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional

suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified
minority (i.e., more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting
or more than one-third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured nonpreferential creditors declare against it. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if
there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no
prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted

the provisional suspension of payments.

The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under

Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights
against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of
payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern
value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party or by its own volition the court can order a “cooling
down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for
another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred.

Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A

composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority
(gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in
amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified
(gehomologeerd) by the court.

434


-----

Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect

a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding.
Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by

a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the
debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be
suspended or cancelled by operation of law.

**_Statutory Composition Proceedings_**

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet

_homologatie onderhands akkoord) (the “WHOA”) on January 1, 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a_
composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is inspired by the UK Scheme of Arrangements
and the U.S. Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a
composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered
to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, _inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the_
restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the
suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result
in claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a
composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend
to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside The Netherlands.
Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and
therefore the Notes.

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two third of

the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of
that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to
be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition
plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution
in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can,
_inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value_
of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive
in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides
for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that
class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to
secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want
to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse
confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible

extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the
possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the
assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the
debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift
attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be

requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is
at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs
to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a
suspension of payments. The debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has
obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of
the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service

435


-----

(het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest
(openbaar belang).

There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a

company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take
appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either
bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above).

As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy

order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds

distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general
principle of Dutch insolvency law is the _paritas creditorum_ (principle of equal treatment), which means that all
creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in
proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and
social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently,
Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a holder of a Note’s potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification,

and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether
and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would
not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest
accruing after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case
interest will be admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the
Notes may be challenged in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting
(verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute
the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’
meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These renvooi proceedings could cause
holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in other
liquidation proceedings. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed
compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to
certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security
or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive
the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with
preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant
preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for
submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the
remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch

bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (pursuant to Article 63a of
the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet)) (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during
which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement
from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security
interest within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the bankruptcy receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet)), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or
assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may be significant).
Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an
unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed
by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters
into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be
challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in
bankruptcy. See below “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.”

436

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments

against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and
certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening
of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the
bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent
guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the
date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to

creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority
(gewone meerderheid) in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in
amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court.
The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors.
Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the
unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a
certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such
subordination is construed.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor

of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring
the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the Holders under or in connection
with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure
only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it
will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However,
the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged,

Holders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document.
In addition, the Holders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as
the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Under Dutch law, the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests over the

Collateral may, in whole or in part, also be affected or limited to the extent that the obligations of Fineska B.V., Eska
International B.V., Eska USA B.V. and Eska B.V. which are incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantors”)
are not within the scope of its objects and the relevant counterparty was aware or ought to have been aware (without
inquiry) of this fact. The articles of association of each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantees and
security. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee
or security interest) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of
association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the
question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act
by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have
an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting
from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company or its administrator in bankruptcy. As a
result, no assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of
the security interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies.
To the extent that a Dutch Guarantor or the administrator of such Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability
or unenforceability of a Guarantee or a security interest, such Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the
extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the

document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging)

437


-----

or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent
in The Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of
security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of
reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening)._

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by a Dutch Guarantor

may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer
_van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such_
company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser
amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least
€22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or,
provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of
€20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and
other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch
company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise,
the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be
suspended or avoided.

The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction

Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement
of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection
costs.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

In the event of the occurrence of certain events, the Security Agent may enforce the security interests created

pursuant to the relevant security documents.

In general, mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and

other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch
law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks
above a non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor
(bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the
debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make
use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a
period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed.

Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition,

foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law.
Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction
has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the
Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch
private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be
transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association
as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced
(through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor.

The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the

competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent
and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become
enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue
to it for a price determined by the court.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions, known as “actio pauliana”, dealing with fraudulent conveyance both

in and outside of bankruptcy. The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means
of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its
or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal
act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by
the bankruptcy receiver in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside
bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii)
the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was
conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or
more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch
insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and
for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security
interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be
prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration.

The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis

when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy.

In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the

basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest
was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had
been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and
the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s
other creditors. If a Dutch court found that the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the granting of the Guarantees or security rights
could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity
may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. In addition, under such circumstances,
holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Dutch Guarantor as
a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

_Topco and the Issuer are incorporated under the laws of Italy. The documents relating to the Collateral will_

_be governed by the laws of Italy and any jurisdiction where the Collateral is located. The Indenture, the Notes and_
_the Guarantees will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility_
_Agreement are governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer_
_are non-residents of the United States. Because substantially all of the assets of Topco and the Issuer and their_
_respective directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States., any judgment obtained in the United_
_States against Topco and the Issuer or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to_
_the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon_
_civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore,_
_although the Issuer will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction_
_of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under_
_U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as_
_mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions_
_of U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws against us or on such other persons as mentioned above in the courts of_
_foreign jurisdiction. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions upon those_
_persons or the Issuer pursuant to other applicable law, regulation or international conventions such as, inter alia,_
_The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial_
_Matters of November 15, 1965._

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against Topco and the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such

judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court
judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the Collateral is located, you should
consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or
elsewhere outside the United States.

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final, enforceable and conclusive judgments rendered by U.S. courts,

including judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state
securities laws, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian
Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato), among others, the
following conditions are met:

    - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of
jurisdiction;

    - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S.
law and during the proceedings the essential rights of defense of the defendant have not been violated;

    - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of
the defendant, party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in
accordance with U.S. law;

    - the judgment is final and binding not subject to any further appeal (passato in giudicato) in accordance
with U.S. law;

    - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

    - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

    - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

440


-----

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S.

court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a proceeding
shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not
consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on

the U.S. federal or state securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian
court may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are
regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought (e.g.,
punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil

liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to
enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany
currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than
arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal
or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would
not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or
state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction
in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). In such
an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court,
except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon
a number of factors, including the following:

    - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

    - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such requirement,
(i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the
proceedings;

    - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court
or (ii) any judgment which became _res judicata_ rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in
Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict any such judgment
under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

    - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany
(Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil
judgement awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory
purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany as they are regarded to be in conflict
with material principles of German law;

    - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

    - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after

having received an _exequatur_ decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles.
Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable.
Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation,

441


-----

moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a
German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German

courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to
compensate actual losses or damages.

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects.

With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may,
prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists
under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in

Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such
circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be
regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German
court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal
or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process

within Germany upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law
implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may
be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional
Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the
U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**The Netherlands**

Each Dutch Guarantor is incorporated under Dutch law and has its registered seat in The Netherlands. Civil

liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in The Netherlands, either in an
original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and The Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition

and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities
laws, would not be enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The
Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice,
generally grant the same judgment without substantive re-examination or re-litigation analysis on the merits if (i) the
foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has
conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (ii) that judgment does not
contravene public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands, (iii) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a
decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a foreign court
in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can
be recognized in The Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is according to the law of its country of origin final
and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a
competent judicial body have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,

investors may be able to enforce in The Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S.
federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is

442


-----

doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced
in The Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in The Netherlands will

be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is
executed in euros at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in The Netherlands will be subject to
the nature of the remedies available in the courts of The Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has
the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being
brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to

the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.

##### Independent auditor’s report
_in accordance with article 14 of Legislative Decree No. 39 of 27 January 2010_

To the Shareholders of Rimini TopCo SpA


###### Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements


**_Opinion_**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Rimini TopCo Group (the Group), which
comprise the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2023, the consolidated income
statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in consolidated
equity, consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position
of the Group as of 31 December 2023, and of the result of its operations and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia).
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for
_the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report. We are independent of_
Rimini TopCo SpA (the Company) pursuant to the regulations and standards on ethics and
independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian law. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**_Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the_**
**_Consolidated Financial Statements_**

The directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true
and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union and, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as they determine is


-----

necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, in
preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriate application of the going concern
basis of accounting, and for disclosing matters related to going concern. In preparing the
consolidated financial statements, the directors use the going concern basis of accounting unless they
either intend to liquidate Rimini TopCo SpA or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative
but to do so.

The board of statutory auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, the
Group’s financial reporting process.

**_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
consolidated financial statements.

As part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia),
we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit.
Furthermore:

- We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures
responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

- We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

- We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;

- We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to
continue as a going concern;

- We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;


-----

- We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated
financial statements.

We communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required
by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified
during our audit.


###### Report on Compliance with other Laws and Regulations


**_Opinion in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 2, letter e), of Legislative Decree_**
**_No. 39/10_**

The directors of Rimini TopCo SpA are responsible for preparing a report on operations of the Rimini
TopCo Group as of 31 December 2023, including its consistency with the relevant consolidated
financial statements and its compliance with the law.

We have performed the procedures required under auditing standard (SA Italia) No. 720B in order to
express an opinion on the consistency of the report on operations with the consolidated financial
statements of the Rimini TopCo Group as of 31 December 2023 and on its compliance with the law, as
well as to issue a statement on material misstatements, if any.

In our opinion, the report on operations is consistent with the consolidated financial statements of
Rimini TopCo Group as of 31 December 2023 and is prepared in compliance with the law.

With reference to the statement referred to in article 14, paragraph 2, letter e), of Legislative Decree
No. 39/10, issued on the basis of our knowledge and understanding of the Company and its
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have nothing to report.

# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

Rimini TopCo S.p.A. (hereinafter "Rimini TopCo", the "Company" or the "Parent Company") is a company established on June 14,
2021 and domiciled in Italy, with registered office in Milan, in Via Alessandro Manzoni, 38 and organized according to the legal
system of the Italian Republic.

The subscribed and paid up share capital of Rimini TopCo amounts to €3,045 thousand, divided into 304,525,482 shares without
nominal value and, in particular, into (i) 4,550,000 class “A” shares, (ii) 355,004 class “B” shares and (iii) 299,620,478 class “C”
shares. The term of the Company is fixed until December 31, 2050. The Company’s ultimate controlling entity is AGM Management,
LLC, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (USA).

It should be noted that in October 2021 the Company acquired the Reno De Medici Group (hereinafter “RDM Group”), which
operates into the recycled cartonboard business.

In more detail, on October 26, 2021, (hereinafter, the “Acquisition Date”) Rimini BidCo S.p.A. (hereinafter “Rimini BidCo” or the
“Offeror”), a subsidiary of Rimini TopCo S.p.A., announced that it had finalized the purchase of approximately 67% of the issued and
outstanding share capital of Reno De Medici S.p.A. from the Company’s two largest shareholders - Cascades Canada ULC and Caisse
de dépot et placement du Québec - at a price of €1.45 per share, thereby acquiring control of the RDM Group.

Following said acquisition, the legal requirements were met for Rimini BidCo S.p.A. to launch a mandatory full takeover bid on all of
the issued and outstanding shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. (the “Offer”) not already owned by the Offeror. The Offer was filed with
CONSOB (the Italian Market Authority) in November 2021, approved by resolution no. 22085/2021 on November 16, 2021 and
successfully completed on December 17, 2021.

In view of the final results of the takeover bid, the Offeror having achieved a shareholding representing 99.94%, the joint procedure
concerning the ordinary shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. still outstanding was started. The procedure was completed on December
29, 2021, the date on which the ordinary shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. were delisted from Euronext Milano – STAR segment, and
the Stock Exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia (Bolsas de Valores Españolas).

On December 16, 2022, Rimini BidCo S.p.A. was officially merged with its direct subsidiary Reno De Medici S.p.A., with the latter as
the surviving entity of the merger. Accordingly, Reno De Medici has assumed all rights and obligations of Rimini BidCo. The merger
has had accounting effects as of January 1, 2022.

These Consolidated Financial Statements were approved for publication by the Board of Directors of Rimini TopCo S.p.A. on February
29, 2024.

The independent audit of these Consolidated Financial Statements is performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A.

## 1.1 Significant events during the period

###### RDM Villa Santa Lucia mill – new operating suspension

In January 2023, the mill at Villa Santa Lucia restarted after production was stopped in the period August-December 2022. The stop
was related to the municipal wastewater treatment plant issues.

On July 27, 2023, the sewage treatment plant serving the paper mill in Villa Santa Lucia was seized by the Cassino Public Prosecutor's
Office. The charge was that of environmental pollution, which the Group does not believe to be justified.

The Group has pursued a collaborative solution and has carried out formal conversations with the administrative authorities to
renew the authorization and restart the mill: after seven months the Group announced the reopening of Villa Santa Lucia mill,
starting from March 4, 2024.

A number of matters are still to be agreed regarding the categorization of some materials and the handling of some flows. The
procedure for the renewal of the environmental authorization will restart in order to have it issued at the earliest

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

###### RDM Blendecques mill – insurance reimbursement and flooding

As of February 2023, the board machine at Blendecques mill has restarted after it stopped production in March 2022 due to a force
majeure fire incident. No employees were hurt in the fire incident. Over the course of April and May 2023, the company receiv ed
the full amount of the insurance reimbursement associated with the Blendecques fire. The proceeds of the reimbursement have
been aimed at completing the reconstruction of the mill.

Reconstruction of the finishing department is still ongoing, and the full operation of the mill has been delayed by the situation of
the market and the heavy flooding suffered at the beginning of November 2023 and again in early January 2024.

In early November 2023, the Pas-de-Calais region, where RDM Blendecques is located, was hit by heavy storms. The mill was also
affected by the unprecedented and unanticipated flooding of the local river. There was no significant damage to machinery at the
mill but production at the mill was temporarily stopped to repair the damage, with production restarting shortly after. A sec ond
heavy storm causing a big flooding happened on 2 [nd] January 2024, and again the mill was temporarily stopped to repair the damage.

###### RDM S.p.A. – tax losses carried forward accepted

On July 10, 2023, the Italian revenue agency accepted the ruling presented by Reno De Medici S.p.A. based on art. no. 172 “Tuir”
(law no. 917/1986). The object of the ruling was the recovery of the financial items of Rimini BidCo S.p.A. (tax losses carried forward,
equity contribution “ACE”, passive financial interests) in Reno De Medici S.p.A. starting from the fiscal year 2022, as a result of the
reverse merger of Rimini BidCo into Reno De Medici.

###### RDM S.p.A. – Fiskeby International Holding AB (“Fiskeby”) acquisition

On July 13, 2023, the Group has finalized the agreement for the acquisition of 100% of share capital of Fiskeby International Holding
AB (“Fiskeby”), a producer of packaging board made from 100% recovered fiber, with one manufacturing facility in Sweden. The
acquisition has been partly funded through a Senior Facility Agreement, undersigned on July 11, 2023 and granted to Reno De
Medici S.p.A by a pool of banks.

The acquisition of Fiskeby demonstrates the long-term strategy that the Group has consistently put forward, inspired by
sustainability, recyclability and circularity expressed in various fiber-based solutions. For the details of this transaction please refer
to note 4. Business combination.

###### Conflict Russia-Ukraine

The continuing conflict between Russia and Ukraine did not have a significant impact on the RDM Group's business. The Group
discontinued business relations with both customers and suppliers in Russia as of 2022, and there was no significant impact given
the Group's low exposure to the Russian market.

# 2. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The main accounting criteria and principles applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the
period ended December 31, 2023 (hereinafter the "Consolidated Financial Statements") are listed below.


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

## 2.1 Basis of Preparation

These Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(hereafter, IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European Union, in force as
of December 31, 2023, and on the basis of the provisions of Legislative Decree 38/2005.

The designation “IFRS” also includes International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) as well as all the interpretations of the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, including those previously issued by the Standing Interpretations Committee
(“IFRIC” and “SIC”).

The Group applied the same accounting principles as for the Annual Financial Report as of December 31, 2022.

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors have verified the absence of
financial, management or other indicators that could indicate critical issues regarding the Group's ability to meet its obligations in
the foreseeable future, and in particular in the next 12 months.

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared and presented in Euro, which represents the working currency of the
prevailing economic environment in which the Group operates. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts included in this document
are expressed in thousands of Euros.

#### Presentation of the financial statements

The Consolidated Financial Statements and the related classification criteria adopted by the Group, as part of the options envisaged
by IAS 1 are presented below:

  - The consolidated income statement was prepared by classifying operating costs by nature;

  - The consolidated statement of comprehensive income, in addition to the result for the period shown in the income

statement, includes revenues and costs that are not recognized in the income statement for the period as required by
IFRS;

  - The consolidated statement of financial position was prepared by classifying assets and liabilities according to the "current

/ non-current" presentation;

  - The consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared to show the cash flows derived from operating activities according

to the "indirect method".

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on the basis of the conventional historical cost method, except for the
valuation of financial assets and liabilities, in which case the classification and measurement criteria set forth by IFRS 9 are applied.

## 2.2 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting

###### SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries, from the date on which control is acquired
until the date that such control ceases to exist. The accounting period and the reporting date of the Consolidated Financial
Statements correspond to those of the Parent company and of all the entities included in the scope of consolidation.

The criteria adopted by the Group for defining the scope of consolidation area and the related consolidation principles, according
to IFRS 10, are described below.

###### CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES

The financial position, results and cash flows of Rimini TopCo Group include the financial position, results and cash flows o f Rimini
TopCo S.p.A. and of the companies over which it has the control. The definition of control is not based solely on the conc ept of legal
ownership. According to IFRS 10, the definition of control is based on three elements: (a) power to direct the investee; (b) exposure
to or rights on variable returns resulting from involvement with the investee; (c) capacity to utilize the power to influence the
amount of these returns. IFRS 10 stipulates that in order to evaluate whether it has control over the investee, an investor should
focus only on activities that materially affect returns and rights which are substantial, i.e., can be exercised in practice when
important decisions have to be taken with regard to the investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which control is acquired until the date that such control ceases to exist. The
portions of shareholders’ equity and profit or loss attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated
statement of financial position, consolidated income statement, and consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The main consolidation principles adopted are as follows:

- The carrying amount of each investment consolidated on a line-by-line basis is eliminated against the related equity, with the
assets, liabilities, income and expense of the subsidiary being added to those of the Parent company, regardless of the size of
the investment; the shares of subsidiaries’ share capital and reserves and of subsidiaries’ profit or loss attributable to minority
interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement;

- The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method as provided for by IFRS 3 (see “Business
Combinations”);

- All balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated, as are any profits and losses (unless losses indicate an
impairment of the asset being transferred, requiring recognition) arising from commercial or financial intragroup transactions
not yet realized with third parties;

- Any increases or decreases in a subsidiary’s equity arising from its post-acquisition results are recorded upon elimination in the
“Retained earnings (losses)” equity reserve;

- Dividends distributed by Group companies are eliminated from the income statement upon consolidation.

In the event of loss of control, the Group will eliminate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any third-party interests, and the
other components of equity relative to the subsidiaries. The profit or loss from the loss of control will be recognized in the profit or
loss for the year. Any equity interest maintained in the former subsidiaries are consolidated at fair value as from the date on which
control was lost and, subsequently, is accounted for using the method reported in the following paragraph “Investments” and cease
to be consolidated on the date on which control is transferred to third parties.

###### CONSOLIDATION OF FOREIGN COMPANIES

The financial statements of each affiliate are prepared in the currency of the economic area they mainly operate in (the func tional
currency). All non-Euro assets and liabilities of foreign companies within the scope of consolidation are translated using the


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

exchange rates as of the reporting date (the current-rate method). Income and expenses are translated at the average rate for the
year. The exchange differences resulting from the use of this approach are recognized in a dedicated equity reserve in “Other
components of comprehensive income” until the disposal of the investment.

The exchange rates used to translate the foreign currency financial statements into Euros are as follows:

Closing rate

December 2023 Opening

Currency December 31,

average rate rate

2023

PLN Polish Zloty 4.3395 4.3335 4.6808

HUF Hungarian Forints 382.8000 381.8032 400.8700

CZK Czech Koruna 24.7240 24.4776 24.1160

GBP Pound Sterling 0.86905 0.86168 0.88693

SEK Swedish Krona 11.096 11.2028 11.8055

###### EQUITY INVESTMENTS 

This item includes equity investments in associates and joint ventures, valued using the equity method, and investments in other
companies valued in accordance with IFRS 9.

Associates are companies over which the Group exercises significant influence, which is presumed to exist when the Group holds
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of the associate company. Associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and
are subsequently valued using the equity method. Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint control
of the arrangements have rights to the net assets of the arrangements.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the results of associates in which its investments are valued
with equity method, from the date that significant influence or joint control is acquired until the date that it ceases to exist. The
Group’s share of unrealized profits from transactions between Group companies is eliminated. Unrealized losses from transactions
between Group companies are eliminated unless they represent actual impairment of the asset transferred. Losses in excess of
shareholders’ equity are accounted for insofar as the investor has a commitment to the investee to abide by legal or constructive
obligations or in any other way to cover its losses.

## 2.3 Valuation Criteria

The most significant accounting principles and valuation criteria used for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements
are briefly described below.

###### BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Business combinations in the scope of IFRS 3 are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method, the consideration
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of
the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group, and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in the income statement at the time they are incurred.

The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as
the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of any non-controlling interest
in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the
acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The acquirer can finalize the allocation of
fair values to individual assets and liabilities of the acquiree and recognize new assets and liabilities arising from the business
combination, within 12 months from the acquisition date – the “Purchase Price Allocation” (PPA) process.


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

If the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the aggregate of the
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously
held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase gain.

At the acquisition date, the non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice between the two methods is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
Any contingent consideration arrangement in the business combination is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included
as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination in order to determine goodwill. Subsequent changes in th e fair
value are recognized in the income statement.

###### TANGIBLE ASSETS

Tangible fixed assets are stated at their original cost of purchase, production or contribution, including directly incurred accessory
costs required to bring an asset into a condition for use. The cost is reduced by accumulated depreciation and any impairment .
Costs for improvements, modernization and transformation incurred after the initial recognition of the asset acquired or produced
internally are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated over their useful life, provided they derive from separate analytical accounting
measurements and when it is probable that the future economic benefits expected from the asset will increase. Replacement costs
of identifiable components of complex assets are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated over their useful life. The residual value
of the replaced component is ascribed to the income statement. Maintenance and repair costs are ascribed to the income statement
in the year they are incurred.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of assets, determined on the basis of the period
during which the asset will be used by the company. Land is not depreciated, even if acquired together with buildings. The
depreciation method applied to an asset (including estimate of its useful life) is reviewed at least at each financial year-end and, if
there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset,
the method shall be changed to reflect the changed pattern.

The Group checks at least once a year if there is any indication that tangible assets have suffered impairment. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss, as described in the section
“Impairment” below. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An impairment loss is recognized when the
recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for previous write-downs no longer exist, the assets are
revalued at the lower of the recoverable value and the previous book value net of depreciation that would have been recorded in
the absence of a write-down, with the adjustment being made on the income statement.

The estimated useful life for the various categories of tangible assets is as follows:

Category Years

Industrial buildings 40 – 33

Buildings

Small structures 20

General plant and machinery 25 – 5

Plants and machinery

Specific plant and machinery 25 – 5

Industrial and commercial equipment Miscellaneous equipment 5 – 4

Furniture and ordinary office
12 – 8
machines


Other assets

###### LEASED ASSETS


Electronic office machines 6 – 5

Means of internal transport 5

Motor vehicles 6 – 4


The Group has entered into lease agreements, mainly relating to buildings, machinery and equipment. The “right of use” assets and
related lease liabilities deriving from a lease according to IFRS 16 are initially measured on the basis of their present value.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- Fixed payments (including fixed payments in substance), net of any lease incentives;

- Variable payments based on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate as of the start date;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such option;

- The payment of penalties for early termination; and

- Payments due in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the renewal option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be easily determined, which is
generally the case with leases held by the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Group
would pay to borrow the funds needed to obtain assets of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment
with similar terms, guarantees and conditions.

The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the entire term of the contract, unless the contract provides for
the transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or the cost of the lease reflects the fact that the lessee will exercise the
purchase option. In this case, the depreciation must be the shorter the useful life of the asset and the duration of the contract. The
estimated useful lives for right-of-use assets are calculated according to the same criterion applied to owned tangible assets. In
addition, the right-of-use asset is decreased by any impairment losses and adjusted to reflect any remeasurement of the associated
lease liability.

In the statement of financial position, the Group presents right-of-use assets within tangible assets and lease liabilities within current
and non-current borrowings.

In the income statement, interest expense on lease liabilities constitutes a component of financial expenses and is shown separately
from the depreciation of right-of-use assets.

The Group recognizes deferred taxation on right-of-use assets and on lease liabilities in relation to contracts for which IFRS 16 is
applied for the first time. Management has assessed the existing tax legislation and interpreted the accounting principles applied,
concluding the recognition of deferred tax is appropriate.

###### ASSETS / LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE

Assets and liabilities and groups of assets and liabilities whose carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale rather
than through continuing use are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. These
assets and liabilities are classified as “Assets held for sale” and are valued at the lower value between their carrying amount and
their fair value less costs to sell. Profits or losses, net of related tax effects, resulting from the valuation or sale of these assets and
liabilities, are recorded under a dedicated item in the income statement.


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist of identifiable assets without physical substance which are controlled by the Group and from which future
economic benefits are expected. Intangible assets are recognized when the cost of an asset can be measured reliably, in accor dance
with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with a definite useful life are measured at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis
over their useful life, i.e., the estimated period during which the asset will be used by the Group.

Category Years

Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights Software licenses 5

Other intangible assets Miscellaneous     multi-year charges 12 – 5

Intangible assets with an undefined useful life are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least once a year, as
explained in the “Impairment” section below. An intangible asset is considered to have an undefined useful life when there is no
foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate positive cash flows for the Group.

###### GOODWILL

Goodwill is classified as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life and is initially recorded at cost, as described above, and
subsequently subjected to an assessment, at least annually, aimed at identifying any losses in value ("impairment test"). The reversal
of impairment loss is not permitted, even if the reasons that led to the impairment cease to exist.

###### IMPAIRMENT

According to IAS 36, at each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets with a finite
useful life to assess whether there are any signs that these assets may have lost value (impairment indicators). If any such signs
exist, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets to determine the write-down amount (impairment test). Where
it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is estimated by taking into account
the provisions contained in accounting standard IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. In estimating the value in use, expected future
cash flows are discounted to present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the asset.

If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is
reduced to the recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. Except for goodwill, when
there is no longer any reason for an impairment loss to be recognized, the carrying amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is
increased to a new carrying amount based on its estimated recoverable value, which may not exceed the net carrying amount that
would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized. The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in th e
income statement.

Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there
is any indication that an asset may be impaired.

###### DERIVATIVES

According to IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments consist of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and qualify for hedge
accounting only if all of the following apply:


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

- The hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception;

- The hedge is expected to be highly effective;

- Effectiveness can be reliably measured;

- The hedge is highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it is designated.

When derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatment applies:

- For a fair-value hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value
of assets or liabilities yielding or bearing a fixed rate), the derivative instrument is measured at fair value and any gain or loss is
recognized in the income statement. At the same time, the carrying amount of the hedged assets or liabilities is adjusted to
reflect the changes in fair value with respect to the hedged risk;

- For a cash flow hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash
flows of assets or liabilities due to variations in exchange rates), the changes in fair value of the instrument are initially
recognized in a dedicated equity reserve in “Other components of comprehensive income” and are subsequently reclassified
to the income statement in line with the effects of the hedged transaction on profit or loss.

If hedge accounting cannot be applied, the gains or losses from the fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments are
recognized immediately in the income statement.

###### TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

Trade and other receivables are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be received. Subsequent adjustments are made
to account for any write-downs. Trade and other receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

###### INVENTORIES

Inventories are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost, determined on a weighted-average basis, and estimated
realizable value, determined from market trends. In the case of raw materials, market value means replacement cost; for finished
goods and semi-finished goods, market value means net realizable value (net of the costs necessary to make the sale) representing
the amount that the Group would expect to obtain from the sale of these goods as part of its normal business.

###### CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

This item consists of available cash on hand and bank deposits, shares in liquid funds and other highly liquid securities which can be
readily converted into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

###### EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The benefits subsequent to the termination of the employment relationship are based on plans that, depending on their features,
are either defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans, according to IAS 19.

In defined-contribution plans, such as the TFR (severance pay) accrued after the 2007 Italian Finance Law came into force, the
obligation of the Company, limited to the payment of a contribution to the State, or to an asset or to a separate legal entity (“fund”),
is determined based on contributions owing after any amounts already paid. Defined-benefit plans, such as TFR accrued before the
2007 Italian Finance Law came into force, are plans for benefits subsequent to the termination of the employment relationship that
are a future obligation and for which the Company bears the relevant actuarial and investment risks. The TFR fund is measured at
the actuarial value of the liability of the Company, in accordance with current legislation and with the national collective and
company-specific labor agreements. The actuarial valuation, based on demographic, financial and turnover assumptions, is
entrusted to independent actuaries. Actuarial gains/ losses are recorded under “Other Components of Comprehensive Income”.


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

Liabilities for obligations relating to other medium- or long-term benefits to employees, such as jubilee or loyalty benefits, are
determined by adopting actuarial assumptions. The effects deriving from changes in the actuarial assumptions or from adjustments
based on past experience are recognized entirely in the income.

###### PROVISIONS FOR RISKS AND CHARGES

The Group records provisions for risks and charges according to IAS 37 when it has a legal or constructive obligation, arisin g from a
past event, where it is probable that a cost will be incurred to fulfill that obligation and when a reliable estimate of the amount can
be made.

Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount that, at the reporting date, the Group could reasonably expect to pay
to extinguish the obligation or transfer it to a third party. Provisions for supplementary agents’ commission represent the calculation
of liabilities based on actuarial techniques performed by independent actuaries. Changes in estimates are recognized in the income
statement of the period in which the change occurs.

The costs that the Company expects to incur to carry out restructuring plans, in accordance with IAS 37, are recorded in the financial
year in which the Group formally defined such plans and gave to the entities concerned a valid expectation that the restructu ring
will take place. The risks where a liability is merely possible are described in the section “Contingent Liabilities, Commitments and
Other Guarantees Given to Third Parties”, but no provision is made.

###### PAYABLES TO BANKS AND OTHER LENDERS

This item includes financial liabilities made up of bank loans, bonds (i.e. Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes) and payables
to other lenders, including payables arising from finance leases. Payables to banks and other lenders are measured at amortized
cost. Financial liabilities are initially recognized at cost, represented by the fair value of the amount received net of acc essory loan
arrangement charges. After initial recording, loans are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is calculated using the
effective interest method taking into account issue costs and any settlement discount or premium.

###### TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES

These liabilities are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be paid. Subsequent measurement is at amortized cost
using the effective interest method.

###### REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues are recognized where it is probable that the Company will obtain the economic benefits associated with the sale of goods
or provision of services, and where the relevant amount can be reliably determined. Revenues are recorded at the fair value of the
consideration received or expected, taking into account any volume of other commercial discounts and premiums.

As regards the sale of goods, revenues are recognized when the Company has transferred to the purchaser the main risks and
benefits of ownership. As regards the provision of services, revenues are recognized at the time the services are rendered.

###### GOVERNMENT GRANTS

Government grants, including non-monetary grants valued at fair value, are recognized when there is a reasonable certainty that
they will be received and that the Group will comply with all the conditions envisaged for their disbursement.

###### TAXES

Current income taxes are based on an estimate of the taxable income for the year and on current legislation in the countries where
the Group operates. The expected liability, net of any payments in advance or withholding tax incurred, is recognized under “Current
taxes”.


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax
base. “Deferred tax liabilities” consist of deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences which will be taxed in future years
in accordance with prevailing tax legislation. “Deferred tax assets” consist of taxes which, despite being recoverable in future years,
refer to the current year and are recognized where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to absorb their
recovery. Deferred tax liabilities were offset by deferred tax assets where conditions specified in IAS 12 were met, notably where
the two items relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and where there is a legally enforceable right to offset in this
manner.

Income taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly credited or charged to shareholders’
equity, in which case the tax effect is recognized directly in that item. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the carryfor ward of
unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the unused tax losses can be used.
Reno De Medici S.p.A. and some of its Italian subsidiaries (R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l.) participated in the national
tax consolidation scheme pursuant to Article 117 et seq. of the Consolidated Income Tax Act (TUIR). Reno De Medici S.p.A. acts as
the consolidating company and becomes a single taxable base for the group of adhering companies, thereby enabling this group to
offset taxable income against tax losses in a single tax return. Each company participating in the national tax consolidation
agreement transfers its taxable income or tax loss to the consolidating company.

The subsidiary R.D.M. Blendecques S.A.S is also part of the national tax consolidation agreement that includes the subsidiaries
R.D.M. Marketing France S.A.S. on the basis of the French “Article 223a of the General Tax Code”.

###### DIVIDENDS

Dividends payable by the Group are reported as a change in equity in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.

###### DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

Financial assets are derecognized when one of the following conditions is met:

- The contractual right to receive the cash flows from the asset has expired;

- The Group has substantially transferred all the risks and benefits associated with the asset, transferred its rights to receive cash
flows from the assets or assumed a contractual obligation to transfer the cash flows received to one or more potential
beneficiaries by virtue of a contract that meets the requirements of the standard ("pass through test");

- The Group has neither transferred nor substantially maintained all the risks and benefits associated with the financial asset but
has ceded control of it.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation is fulfilled, canceled or
prescribed. An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different contractual terms must be accounted for as an extinction
of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial change in the contractual terms
of an existing financial liability, even partial, must be accounted for as an extinction of the original financial liability and the
recognition of a new financial liability.

###### CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Euros using the exchange rate on the reporting date, with the relevant gain
or loss recorded on the income statement.

## 2.4 Estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to apply accounting principles and methods which, in certain
circumstances, are based on difficult and subjective assessments and estimates, on the basis of historical experience and
assumptions that are considered reasonable from time to time and realistic according to the relative circumstances.

The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the financial statements: the statement of
financial position, the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows, and the other
information provided. The final outcome of the financial statement items for which the aforementioned estimates and assumptions
have been used may differ from those reported in the financial statements, which show the effects of the occurrence of the event
being estimated, due to the uncertainty that characterizes the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.

The areas that require more subjectivity on the part of the Directors when preparing the estimates, and for which a change in the
conditions underlying the assumptions used could have a significant impact on the financial data, are briefly described below.

a) Impairment of assets: In accordance with the accounting standards applied by the companies of the Group, tangible and
intangible assets, and goodwill in particular, are subject to verification in order to ascertain whether a reduction in value has
been incurred, which must be recognized through a write-down, when there are indicators that suggest difficulties in recovering
the related net book value through use. The verification of the existence of the aforementioned indicators requires the direc tors
to make subjective assessments based on the information available within the Group companies and on the market, as well as
from historical experience. Furthermore, if it is determined that a potential impairment may have occurred, the companies of
the Group proceed with the determination of the impairment using valuation techniques deemed appropriate. The correct
identification of the elements indicating the existence of a potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, as well as
the estimates for their determination, depend on factors that may vary over time, influencing the assessments and estimates
made by the Directors.

b) Depreciation and amortization: The cost of tangible and intangible assets with definite useful lives is amortized on a straight
line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. The useful economic life of these assets is determined by the
Directors when they are purchased. It is based on historical experience for similar assets, market conditions, and anticipations
regarding future events that could have an impact on the useful life of the assets, including changes in technology. Therefore,
the actual economic life may differ from the estimated useful life.

c) Provisions for risks and charges: Provisions representing the risk of a negative outcome are recognized for legal and tax risks.
The value of the provisions recorded in the financial statements relating to these risks represents the best estimate at the date
made by the Directors. This estimate involves the adoption of assumptions that depend on factors which may change over time
and could have a significant effect compared to the current estimates made by the Directors for the preparation of the Group's
financial statements.

d) Provision for doubtful receivables: The provision for doubtful receivables reflects the estimated losses for the receivable’s

portfolio. Accruals were made for expected credit losses, estimated on the basis of past experience with reference to
receivables with similar credit risk, current and historical unpaid amounts, as well as careful monitoring of the quality of the
receivable’s portfolio and current conditions and forecasts of the economy and reference markets. The estimates and
assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of each change are reflected in the income statement for the year in
question.

e) Deferred taxes assets: The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is subject to the subsidiaries reporting sufficient future

taxable profits against which the tax losses or the other deferred tax assets can be used. Significant judgments are required of
management to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized in the financial statements based on the
timing and amount of future taxable income.

assesses and performs financial risk hedges. The treasury function provides indications for monitoring risk management, as well as
providing indications for specific areas, concerning interest rate risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative instruments.

#### EXCHANGE RATE RISK

The Group’s functional currency is the EUR. The exposure to exchange rate risk relates to sales, purchases, receivables, current
accounts, borrowings and loans expressed in currencies other than the functional currency, mainly in USD, GBP and SEK. With
reference to all currencies except to SEK, in terms of exposure to currency risk in 2023 the Group managed the marginal imbalance
between investments and funds in the same currency by using a natural-hedging approach and by carefully and continually
monitoring market conditions; as a result, it was not deemed necessary to resort to hedging derivatives. We highlight that Fiskeby
group has the Swedish krona (SEK) as its functional currency and uses forward exchange rates contracts to hedge currency risk
related to their sales in EUR and USD. As of December 31, 2023, following the acquisition of Fiskeby group, these derivative
instruments have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group; since no formal designation for hedge
accounting purposes has been elected, these derivatives are recognized at fair value through profit and loss according to IFRS 9.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the Group’s profit and loss to the fluctuations in exchange rates versus the functional
currency:

Net exposure EUR 7,876 4,246 (1) 5 251 25 10,792 26 135

#### COMMODITY RISK

The commodity risk mainly refers to the movements of the prices of the raw materials that are purchased for production and the
margins that are influenced by the possibility of reversing the trend of the prices of energy and raw materials on the prices of the
products sold. Most contractual relationships with customers involve a transfer of the price risk of the raw materials to the
customer. In order to mitigate the price risk where the transfer is not foreseen, the price lists with customers are reviewed on a
quarterly basis.

More in detail, the nature of the Group’s business involves exposure to fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas and
certain chemical products derived from petroleum (such as latexes) and fibrous raw materials. Natural gas supply contracts are
usually agreed for total requirements at a fixed price and are negotiated at least three months before the supply period, but
sometimes for longer periods in relation to the supply period. Electricity is purchased partly at a fixed price, and partially indexed
according to the values of continental electricity markets as published by the bodies responsible for these markets. In order to
contain possible price pressure on raw materials, the Group aims to diversify its suppliers and its supply markets.

As of the date of the statement of financial position there are no derivative instruments held to commodity risk.

#### INTEREST RATE RISK

Interest rate risk mainly refers to the Group’s exposure to changes in cash flows due to fluctuation in market interest rates, with
particular reference to the interest expense outflows paid on financial debt.

As of December 31, 2023, about 70% of the Group's financial debt is composed of the Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes which substantially bear interest cost at a rate equal to Euribor 3 months (with a 0% floor) plus 5.25% per annum, reset
quarterly, and about 20% of the Group's financial debt is composed of the Senior Facility Agreement which substantially bear
interest cost at a rate equal to Euribor 6 months (with a 0% floor) plus 3.00% per annum. The Deferred Price related to Fiskeby
Group acquisition, amounting to €8,7 million as of December 31, 2023 and about 1% of the Group's financial debt, follows the same
rate rules of the Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.

With the acquisition of Fiskeby, the Group has acquired a credit line granted in SEK by Nordea Bank in Sweden for an amount of
€19.3 million as of December 31, 2023.

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

The Group remains exposed to residual interest rate risk for the bank loans that are held for which the uncovered variable rate
financial debt represents an element of risk of impact that could occur on the income statement and on cash flows as a result of an
increase in market interest rates.

The main exposure to interest rate risk derives from the Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and from the
Senior Facility Agreement. With reference to the Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the Group in 2023 has
decided to hedge the financial liability to mitigate this exposure by the subscription of a Rate Collar that covers a notional amount
of €220 million (out of a total nominal amount of €445 million); the instrument has a cap rate of 3.972%, a floor rate of 2.68%, and
is effective from December 15, 2023 to December 15, 2025. With reference to the Senior Facility Agreement the group has decided
not to hedge the financial liability to mitigate this exposure.

An increase or reduction of 25 basis points in Euribor rates would result in an increase/decrease of finance expense of €871
thousand in 2024 and €1.9 million over the residual maturity of the Notes.

The Notes also include a step-up feature: from June 15, 2026 the interest rate will increase by 0.5%, 1.0% or 1.5% depending on
whether respectively, one, two or three of the Sustainability Performance Targets defined in the Offering Memorandum are not
achieved. Considering the actions put in place by the management and the potential change in the perimeter of the Group
companies included in the valuation of the targets, as a result of M&A transactions either already realized and forecasted, the
management does not see any critical element that could impair the ability of the Group to achieve all three targets by 2025. The
company has therefore not revised its estimate of payments and accordingly not included the step-up feature in the amortized cost
of the Notes.

###### IBOR REFORM

A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some interbank
offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk‑free rates (referred to as ‘IBOR reform’).

With respect to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate – Euribor, during 2019 the calculation methodology changed and in July 2019 the
European Money Markets Institute was granted authorization for administration of Euribor under the European Union Benchmarks
Regulation by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
substituted the Belgian FSMA on January 1, 2022.

This allows market participants to continue to use Euribor for both existing and new contracts. The Group expects that Euribor will
continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future.

###### CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is essentially derived from receivables from customers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the
individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of
its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.

To mitigate the credit risk related to commercial counterparties, and therefore domestic and foreign customers, the Group's
operating companies have put in place procedures aimed at ensuring that product sales are made to customers who are deemed
reliable according to the Group’s standard payment and delivery conditions.

This risk, which takes the form of the possibility that the counterparty does not fulfill its contractual obligations, is mitigated through
constant monitoring of each Group company’s commercial exposure and the collection times of receivables.

The amount of financial assets considered of doubtful recoverability is not significant; in any case it is covered by appropriate
allocations to the provision for doubtful receivables. See Note 19 for more details about the provision for doubtful receivables.

###### LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity risk is associated with the Group’s ability to meet commitments arising mainly from financial liabilities. A prudent
management of the liquidity risk arising from normal operations implies the maintenance of an adequate level of cash and the
availability of funds obtainable through an adequate amount of credit lines.

The following table shows the expected cash flows (principal and interest) in the coming years related to the liabilities shown below

###### CAPITAL RISK

The Group's objective in capital risk management is mainly to safeguard business continuity so as to guarantee returns to
shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders. The Group also sets itself the goal of maintaining an optimal capital structure in
order to reduce the cost of debt.

###### FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY CATEGORY

Trade receivables and other financial assets, payables to suppliers, other liabilities and loans recorded under "current" items in the
statement of financial position are measured using the amortized cost method. As these are assets underlying trading relationships
whose settlement is expected in the short term, their fair value does not differ from their book values in the financial statements
as of December 31, 2023.

Non-current financial liabilities and assets are regulated or valued at market rates and it is therefore deemed that their fair value is
essentially in line with the current accounting values.

Below is a classification of financial assets and liabilities by category of December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Long term non-current borrowings include the Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes issued by Reno De Medici
S.p.A. at a nominal amount of €445.0 million and the Senior Facility Agreement entered by Reno De Medici S.p.A. at a nominal
amount of €126.0 million. The Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes pay interest at a variable rate of Euribor 3
months (with a 0% floor) plus 5.25% per annum; the Senior Facility Agreement pays interest at a variable rate of Euribor 6 months
plus 3.00% per annum.

###### FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE

The fair value of financial instruments listed on an active market is based on market prices as of the statement of financial position
date.

The fair value of instruments that are not listed on an active market is determined using valuation techniques based on a series of
methods and assumptions related to market conditions at the statement of financial position date, including: current or recent
quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active; or, a net present value calculated using discount rates derived
from quoted yields of instruments with similar maturity and credit rating that are traded in active markets, adjusted by an illiquidity
factor.

As of December 31, 2023 the Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes have a carrying amount at amortized cost of €436.1 million;
their last market price quoted on Euro MTF on December 18, 2023 was 100.250%, therefore its fair value (measured as a level 1
fair value) as of December 31, 2023 is €446.1 million.

The fair values of the remaining borrowings are not materially different from their carrying amounts, since the interest payable on
those borrowings is aligned to current market rates and the spread applied to Euribor reflects the credit risk of the Group entities.

Disclosures of fair value are not required for lease liabilities, in accordance with IFRS 7 paragraph 29.

As of December 31, 2023 the Group hold interest rate swaps derivative instruments and foreign-exchange derivative instruments
acquired with the integration of Fiskeby. In addition and with reference to the Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Floating Rate

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

Notes, the Group in 2023 has decided to hedge the financial liability to mitigate this exposure with the subscription of a Rate Collar
that covers the notional amount of €220 million (out of a total nominal amount of €445 million); the instrument has a cap rate of
3.972%, a floor rate of 2.68%, and is effective from December 15, 2023 to December 15, 2025. These financial instruments are
measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9; their fair value is measured at the mark-to-market provided by the counterparty
banks (as a level 2 fair value).

The Group does not hold any other financial assets or financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss or at fair
value through other comprehensive income.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the group classifies its financial instruments
into the three levels of the “Fair Value Hierarchy”, as prescribed under the accounting standards IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 .

The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognized at fair value at December
31, 2023 on a recurring basis.

Total Financial Liabilities - 3,029 - 3,029

The IRS and FX forward instruments have been acquired with the integration of Fiskeby group, starting from July 1, 2023, while the
rate collar has been subscribed in December 2023.

An explanation for each level included in the table is listed below:

Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (e.g. publicly traded derivatives and debt securities) is based
on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price incorporates the market's assumptions with
respect to changes in economic climate such as rising interest rates and inflation, as well as changes due to ESG risk. These
instruments are included in level 1.

Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. over the counter derivatives) is
determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entityspecific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is
the case for unlisted equity securities and for instruments where credit risk gives rise to a significant unobservable valuation
component.

VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND INPUTS USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments may include:

  - the use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments;

  - for interest rate swaps: the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves;

  - for foreign currency forwards: the present value of future cash flows based on the forward exchange rates at the reporting
date;

  - for other financial instruments: discounted cash flow analysis.

All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2, as they rely in particular on unobservable credit risk components of
the issuer of the instruments. The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been derived from the mark-to-market valuations
provided by the counterparty banks.

FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (UNRECOGNISED)

The Group also has a number of financial instruments which are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position.
For the majority of these instruments, including trade receivables and payables, bank loans and other borrowings, the fair values
are not materially different to their carrying amounts, since the interest receivable/payable is either close to current market rates
and the spread applied reflects the credit risk of the counterparties, or the instruments are short-term in nature.

As of December 31, 2023 the Senior Secured Sustainability-linked Notes have a carrying amount at amortized cost of €436.1 million;
their last market price quoted on Euro MTF on December 18, 2023 was 100.250%, therefore their fair value (measured as a level 1
fair value) as of December 31, 2023 is €446.1 million. This is the most significant difference between the carrying amount and the
fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position.

# 4. BUSINESS COMBINATION

###### Acquisition of Fiskeby International Holding AB

As reported in the paragraph 1.1 - Significant events during the period, the Group signed the agreement for the acquisition of Fiskeby
International Holding AB on July 13, 2023.

The transaction price included an upfront component of €127.5 million, of which €125.3 million were paid to the seller and €2.2
million were paid to the management of the company as bonuses. The transaction price also included two deferred payments of
€4.3 million (due on March 31, 2024) and €4.3 million (due on March 31, 2025). The total investment amounted therefore to €136.2
million.

As a result of this transaction, Reno de Medici S.p.A. controls Fiskeby International Holding AB with a 100% stake. The acquisition
date has been conventionally set at July 1[st], 2023. The entities included in the Fiskeby sub-group are:

Name Town / Country Shareholding Notes

Fiskeby International Holding AB NORRKÖPING (Sweden) 100%

Fiskeby Board AB NORRKÖPING (Sweden) 100%

Fiskeby UK Woodford Green, Essex (UK) 100%

Fiskeby Germany Ottobeuren (Germany) 100%

Eby Fastigheter i Norrköping AB NORRKÖPING (Sweden) 0% Real estate SPV, consolidated according to IFRS 10(§)

_(§) Fiskeby has a put and call agreement with AGNAF AB, entered in 2017, regarding the warehouse called “Fiskeby 1:73”. The agreement also includes a rental_
_agreement under which Fiskeby leases the warehouse during years 2017-2027. According to the agreement, Fiskeby has the right to buy all the shares in the property_
_company at the amount of 1 SEK at the end of the leasing period (March 31, 2027) and the counterparty has the right to sell their shares to Fiskeby for the same_
_amount. During the option period, the seller undertakes not to make decisions without Fiskeby’s approval in most matters in the operation activities and strategic_
_decision. Fiskeby has also right to appoint a member of the board and should have insight of the activities in the company. Under IFRS 10 it’s possible to control and_
_consolidate an affiliate based solely on an agreement without owning any shares considering all the facts and circumstances. Based on the fact stated above, it can_
_be argued that Fiskeby controls the company, in such a way that it should be consolidated as a subsidiary and not accounted for under the legal agreement as a lease._
_Therefore, the entity has been consolidated in the Group since inception on July 1, 2023. No minorities have been recognized since the put option is accounted for_
_under IFRS 10 and IFRS 9 framework as a financial liability._

In these consolidated financial statements as of and for year ended December 31, 2023, TopCo Group availed of the option allowed
by IFRS 3 (revised) to provisionally allocate the cost of the transaction to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed, and as of December 31, 2023 a provisional Goodwill of €111.6 million was calculated.

The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities of Fiskeby Group as of the acquisition date (July 1, 2023):

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to
the segment and assess its performance; and iii) for which discrete financial information is available.

The Group’s business activities are not organised on the basis of differences in products and services or on differences in
geographical areas of operations, since reportable revenues derive essentially from the same product, i.e. recycled cartonboard.
Even if the Group hold assets in different geographical areas, customers are served from different mills in different countries,
according to the “Multi-mill concept”.

Therefore, the Group has determined that it has only one reportable segment (“Recycled Board”) based on the information
reviewed by its Chief Operating Decision Maker, defined as the Board of Directors of the Company, in making decisions regarding
allocation of resources and to assess performance.

# 6. REVENUES FROM SALES

More than 85% of the Group's revenues relate to sales with customers in Italy and Europe and the remaining revenues are generated
through sales to customers from the rest of the world. For additional details on revenues breakdown, please refer to the
Management Report.


For the period ended December 31,

_(in Euro thousand)_ 2023 2022


Variation


Italy 201,278 308,041 (106,763)

European Union 480,543 703,772 (223,229)

Rest of the world 116,616 210,535 (93,919)

Total 798,437 1,222,348 (423,911)

Revenues from sales amounted to €798.4 million, compared to €1,222.3 million of the previous period.

As of December 31, 2023 the decrease was primarily attributable to the contraction of market demand. The decrease of market
demand affected the entire market and is due to a general weak demand and prices reduction as consequence of inflation
downward path since the beginning of the year.

The 2022 revenues have been characterized by increases in sales prices partially offset by decreases in volumes due to the
Blendecques and Villa Santa Lucia mills production shutdown. These shutdowns are respectively due to a fire occurred at
Blendecques mill in March 2022 and to the stop of the external water treatment plant at Villa Santa Lucia mill, due to causes not
under control of Reno De Medici.

Taxes decreased by €26.7 million, to a revenue of €3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a cost amount
of €22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The benefit is mainly related to positive taxation in Reno De Medici S.p.A.
and includes the benefit from the possibility to utilize tax losses carried forward of Rimini BidCo S.p.A. which were not ded ucted in
previous years, for a positive impact of €7.4 million on 2023 taxes.

On May 23, 2023 IASB emitted the document Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model
Rules:

On January 1, 2024 came into effect the new Pillar 2 rules, required by UE directive n. 2523 of December 14, 2022, adopted in Italy
with “D.lgs. n. 209” of December 27, 2023 (“Decreto”), implementing the new reform about international taxation. These rules are
applied in TopCo Group as a Multinational Group that exceed the threshold of €750 million of revenues for two of the four previous
fiscal years and having as Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) Rimini TopCo S.p.A.

On the base of Pillar 2 rules, the entities included in the group perimeter (localized everywhere) must be subject of a level of
effective taxation on income at least of 15%, to be determined on the base of an articulated counting built on accounting and fiscal


-----

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

data. In the case in which these entities are subject to a level of taxation lower than 15%, it will be applied a minimum tax (Top-Up
Tax) that will lead the level of effective taxation to 15%.

The exposition to income taxes of Pillar 2 depends, relating to all group companies (and the eventual join-ventures entities) that
are located in every single jurisdiction, from the level of effective taxation that, for every single jurisdiction, depends from various
factors, interconnected between them, mainly the income produced, the level of nominal rate, the fiscal rules for the determination
of tax base, the forecast, the form and the utilization of incentives and other fiscal benefits.

Furthermore, considering the new law and the complexity under the determination of the level of effective taxation, the legislation
of Pillar 2 implies, for the first periods of effectiveness (transitory regime valid for the periods that start before December 31, 2026
and expire no later than June 6, 2028), the possibility to apply a simplified regime (Transitional Safe Harbours country by country),
mainly based on accounting information available for every relevant jurisdiction that, in case of passing at least one of the three
tests, implies the reduction of losses and the elimination of Pillar 2 taxes.

In accordance with the disclosure requirements of IAS 12, the Rimini TopCo Group made an analysis in order to identify the
application perimeter of Pillar 2 rules, as well as the potential impacts that derive from the application of the law in the different
Countries in which it operates, taking into account the mentioned Transitional Safe Harbours.

Therefore, after the identification of all the in-scope entities of the Group for the discipline, aligned with what reported by the
“Decreto” and with the OCSE guidelines, the Rimini TopCo Group adopted the “Transitional Safe Harbours” (“TSH”), in relation with
every Country in which it operates.

In relation with the Countries in which any TSH test have been passed, the Rimini TopCo Group will be obliged to perform a
calculation of the level of effective taxation based on the entire set of rules of Pillar 2 reported by the “Decreto” adding in this
manner, to the accounting and fiscal data of the entities localized in these Countries, the adjustments provided by that law, also
with the aim to determine, where the level of effective taxation is lower than 15%, the value of the minimum tax.

On base of the analysis performed, with respect of Pillar 2, the entity Rimini TopCo S.p.A. is qualified as “Ultimate Parent Entity” or
“UPE”.

The application of TSH has been conducted on the basis of the information available in the Country-by-Country Report, prepared
by the UPE for 2022 Fiscal Year, considering the “aggregated data” of the entities part of Rimini TopCo Group for every Country in
which it operates (“Jurisdictional Approach”).

It should be noted that the analysis have been performed also taking into consideration some points that are still under examination
and not clarified by OCSE.

On the basis of that analysis, the THS results are positive on almost all the entities of Rimini TopCo Group and, in any case, it is
assumed that, according to the assessments performed until now, the combined application of THS and Pillar 2 rules don’t
determine, in 2024 Fiscal Year, a significant exposition to Top-Up Tax for Rimini TopCo Group.

The considerations mentioned above are based on a forward-looking evaluation of fiscal charge, determined considering the data
and the information available in this moment and on the basis of a simplified approach. An accurate estimate of fiscal charge for
jurisdiction will be possible only once the data of 2024 Fiscal Year will be available.

In the end, it should be pointed out that, in accordance with IAS 12, the entity doesn’t have detected any effect on deferred taxation
coming from the entry in force of the Pillar 2 rules from January 1, 2024.

# 13. GOODWILL

The item “Goodwill” amounts to € 243.7 million (€ 132.1 million on December 31, 2022). The increase is related to the provisi onal
goodwill allocated on the TopCo Group on December 31, 2023 for the Fiskeby’s acquisition. For more information, see paragraph
_Business Acquisition._

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (continued)**

Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Reno De Medici Group by Rimini TopCo S.p.A. (the “TopCo goodwill”) has been allocated
to one cash-generating unit (“CGU”) identified as the Reno De Medici Group itself (excluding Fiskeby); while the new provisional
goodwill deriving from the acquisition of Fiskeby (the “Fiskeby goodwill”) has been allocated to a separate CGU identified as the
Fiskeby sub-group.

For the purposes of preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has ascertained that there are some indicators
that may suggest difficulties in recovering the book value of the TopCo goodwill, also considering the results achieved by the
business until December 31, 2023, and the surge in market interest rates during the year.

However, the TopCo goodwill has been tested for impairment according to IAS 36 as of December 31, 2023 and as a result no
reduction in value has been recorded.

For the 2023 reporting period, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit was determined based on value in use
calculations, which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved
by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term
growth rate of 2%, which is consistent with industry forecasts.

The projected cash flows have been discounted at a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) rate, in which the cost of equity is
calculated in accordance with the capital assets pricing model methodology and the cost of debt reflects the actual interest rates
paid by the Group.

The Fiskeby goodwill has not been tested for impairment since the process of purchase price allocation (the “PPA”) is still ongoing
as of December 31, 2023 and will be concluded in the first half 2024 according to IFRS 3.

Investments in tangible assets are related to: (i) additions to land and buildings for €4.6 million; (ii) additions to plant and machinery
for €16.9 million are mainly related to: Arnsberg Bridge A for €1.8 million, Santa Giustina Landfill for €1.5 million; (iii) new
Cogeneration Plant in Barcelona €8.1 million (iv) other tangible assets and assets under construction for €52.9 million mainly related
Blendecques reconstruction for €27.7 million.

The devaluations indicated in the tangible fixed assets are mainly attributable to Blendecques mill in consideration of the Project
Retrò described above. The assets in Blendecques have been valuated at their recoverable amount, i.e. fair value less costs to sell,
in accordance with IAS 36.

The net book value of assets of Blendeques mill resulted aligned and justified from the assessment performed last year through an
opinion from a third party expert with evaluation method in line with principles and practices of the market. Since the assessment
resulted to be recent and used for the purchase price allocation performed in 2022, it was considered valid to use the same Fair
Value of the assets for the impairment test, less the amortization of the current fiscal year.

Furthermore, some assets have been reconstructed during fiscal year 2023 and the entity has evaluated that the costs of
reconstruction are in line with market prices. Also in this case have not been detected exceptions. Therefore, the fair value of assets
as above determined has been reduced by the anticipated amortization of the period and of the further costs to sell, engagement
and disinvestment.

From the calculation performed, the results are a devaluation of €14.4 million and an accrual of deferred tax of €3.6 million.

The change in right-of-use (leased) assets can be detailed as follows:

equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties; expected credit losses have not been
measured also considering the short-term maturity of such exposures.

The principal change in 2023 is due to the opening in Reno De Medici of Time Deposits accounts, while the bank deposits have
decreased by €3.5 million.

Reduction of discount rate

The sensitivity analysis reported above is carried out based on changes in individual assumptions, maintaining the other assumptions
unchanged, although in practice any changes in an assumption can generally be reflected in the others due to potential corr elations.
The sensitivity analysis reported above was calculated using the same method (projected unit credit method) used to define the
valuation of the liability recorded in the statement of financial position.

Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to certain risks, the most significant of which are described below.

###### Discounting and inflation rate risk

The present value of defined benefit pension plans is calculated using a discount rate determined using high quality corporate bond
yields. A decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in the liability. A decrease in the inflation rate would result in a
decrease in the liability.

###### Probability of resignations 

The present value of defined benefit pension plans is calculated using the best estimate of resignations. An increase in the rate of
resignations and advances would result in an increase in the liability.

###### Information on contributions received by public authorities or equivalent entities

Article 1, paragraphs 125-129 of Italian Law 124/2017, later integrated by Decree Law 113/2018 (Security) and by Decree Law
135/2018 (Simplification), introduced the framework governing transparency of public funds.

The information requested is provided below. In 2023 the Group entities based in Italy received the following contributions:


Description

(in Euro thousand)

Tax credits to companies using energy (Art. 4
D.L. 17/2022 “Energia”)

Tax credits to companies with high gas
consumption (Art. 5 D.L. 17/2022 “Energia”)


Received from Entity Amount 2023 Of which: used /

received in 2023

Agenzia delle Entrate 4,852 11,206

Agenzia delle Entrate 3,903 6,015


Professional Traning Fondimpresa/Fondirigenti 53 35

In 2022 and 2023 the Italian Tax Agency (“Agenzia delle Entrate”) allowed tax credits based on the consumption of energy and gas:
in 2023 the utilization of the credit is higher than the maturation because credits from 2022 have been utilized. The residual of
these credits at December 31, 2023 is zero.

###### Subsequent events

In relation with the event that occurred at the Reno de Medici paper mill in Villa Santa Lucia, the Group has continued to pursue a
collaborative approach to resolve the situation and has carried out formal conversations with the administrative authorities to
renew the authorization and restart the mill. A satisfactory solution of the technically unresolved issues has been reached as of the
end of February 2024, and the mill will start on March 4, 2024. The pending technical issues still ongoing will be discussed with the
administrative authorities in the next weeks to obtain the renewal of the authorization with all matters agreed.

Our Blendecques mill was shut down since March 22, 2022 as a result of a fire that occurred due to causes outside our control, and
has been hit twice by flooding in November 2023 and January 2024, as described above. To mitigate the current overcapacity in our
European market and address the underperformance of the Blendecques mill, the Group is currently considering strategic
alternatives and currently intend to cease operations at the Blendecques mill in the second half of 2024. We believe the closure of
this mill will improve our profitability, optimize our industrial footprint and allow us to more efficiently adapt our curren t mill
capacity to changes in demand for cartonboard, capacity in the market as well as the resulting pricing pressures.

##### Independent auditor’s report
_in accordance with article 14 of Legislative Decree No. 39 of 27 January 2010_

To the Shareholders of Rimini TopCo SpA


###### Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements


**_Opinion_**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Rimini TopCo Group (the Group), which
comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2022, the consolidated
income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in
consolidated equity, consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and explanatory
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position
of the Group as of 31 December 2022, and of the result of its operations and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia).
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for
_the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report. We are independent of_
Rimini TopCo SpA (the Company) pursuant to the regulations and standards on ethics and
independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian law. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**_Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the_**
**_Consolidated Financial Statements_**

The directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true
and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union and, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as they determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


-----

The directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, in
preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriate application of the going concern
basis of accounting, and for disclosing matters related to going concern. In preparing the consolidated
financial statements, the directors use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend
to liquidate Rimini TopCo SpA or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The board of statutory auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, the
Group’s financial reporting process.

**_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
consolidated financial statements.

As part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia),
we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit.
Furthermore:

- We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures
responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

- We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

- We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;

- We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern;

- We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

- We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated
financial statements.


-----

We communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required
by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified
during our audit.


###### Report on Compliance with other Laws and Regulations


**_Opinion in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 2, letter e), of Legislative Decree_**
**_No. 39/10_**

The directors of Rimini TopCo SpA are responsible for preparing a report on operations of the Rimini
TopCo Group as of 31 December 2022, including its consistency with the relevant consolidated
financial statements and its compliance with the law.

We have performed the procedures required under auditing standard (SA Italia) No. 720B in order to
express an opinion on the consistency of the report on operations with the consolidated financial
statements of the Rimini TopCo Group as of 31 December 2022 and on its compliance with the law, as
well as to issue a statement on material misstatements, if any.

In our opinion, the report on operations is consistent with the consolidated financial statements of
Rimini TopCo Group as of 31 December 2022 and is prepared in compliance with the law.

With reference to the statement referred to in article 14, paragraph 2, letter e), of Legislative Decree
No. 39/10, issued on the basis of our knowledge and understanding of the Company and its
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have nothing to report.

# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

Rimini TopCo S.p.A. (hereinafter "Rimini TopCo", the "Company" or the "Parent Company") is a company established
on June 14, 2021 and domiciled in Italy, with registered office in Milan, in Via Alessandro Manzoni, 38 and organized
according to the legal system of the Italian Republic.

The subscribed and paid up share capital of Rimini TopCo amounts to €3,045 thousand, divided into 304,525,482 shares
without nominal value and, in particular, into (i) 4,550,000 class “A” shares, (ii) 355,004 class “B” shares and (iii)
299,620,478 class “C” shares. The term of the Company is fixed until 31 December 2050. The Company’s ultimate
controlling entity is AGM Management, LLC, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
(USA).

It should be noted that in October 2021 the Company acquired the Reno De Medici Group (hereinafter “RDM Group”),
which operates into the recycled cartonboard business.

In more detail, on October 26, 2021, (hereinafter, the “Acquisition Date”) Rimini BidCo S.p.A. (hereinafter “Rimini Bidco”
or the “Offeror”), a subsidiary of Rimini TopCo S.p.A., announced that it had finalized the purchase of approximately
67% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Reno De Medici S.p.A. from the Company’s two largest shareholders

- Cascades Canada ULC and Caisse de dépot et placement du Québec - at a price of €1.45 per share, thereby acquiring
control of the RDM Group.

Following said acquisition, the legal requirements were met for Rimini BidCo S.p.A. to launch a mandatory full takeover
bid on all of the issued and outstanding shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. (the “Offer”) not already owned by the Offeror.
The Offer was filed with CONSOB (the Italian Market Authority) in November 2021, approved by resolution no.
22085/2021 on November 16, 2021 and successfully completed on December 17, 2021.

In view of the final results of the takeover bid, the Offeror having achieved a shareholding representing 99.94%, the
joint procedure concerning the ordinary shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. still outstanding was started. The procedure
was completed on December 29, 2021, the date on which the ordinary shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. were delisted
from Euronext Milano – STAR segment, and the Stock Exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia (Bolsas de
Valores Españolas).

On December 16, 2022, Rimini BidCo S.p.A. was officially merged with its direct subsidiary Reno De Medici S.p.A., with
the latter as the surviving entity of the merger. Accordingly, Reno De Medici has assumed all rights and obligations of
Rimini BidCo. The merger has had accounting effects as of January 1, 2022.

These Consolidated Financial Statements were approved for publication by the Board of Directors of Rimini TopCo S.p.A.
on April 12, 2023.

The independent audit of these Consolidated Financial Statements is performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A.

# 2. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The main accounting criteria and principles applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements as of
and for the period ended December 31, 2022 (hereinafter the "Consolidated Financial Statements") are listed below.

## 2.1 Basis of Preparation

These Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (hereafter, “IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the
European Union, in force as of December 31, 2022, and on the basis of the provisions of Legislative Decree 38/2005.

The designation “IFRS” also includes International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) as well as all the interpretations of the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, including those previously issued by the Standing
Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC” and “SIC”).

The Group applied the same accounting principles as for the Annual Financial Report as of December 31, 2021.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors have verified the
absence of financial, management or other indicators that could indicate critical issues regarding the Group's ability to
meet its obligations in the foreseeable future, and in particular in the next 12 months. The description of the methods
through which the Group manages financial risks is contained in the following note 3 relating to "Risk management".

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared and presented in Euro, which represents the working currency
of the prevailing economic environment in which the Group operates. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts included
in this document are expressed in thousands of Euro.

#### Presentation of the financial statements

The Consolidated Financial Statements and the related classification criteria adopted by the Group, as part of the
options envisaged by IAS 1 are presented below:

- The consolidated income statement was prepared by classifying operating costs by nature;

- The consolidated statement of comprehensive income, in addition to the result for the period shown in the income
statement, includes revenues and costs that are not recognized in the income statement for the period as required
by IFRS;

- The consolidated statement of financial position was prepared by classifying assets and liabilities according to the
"current / non-current" presentation;

- The consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared to show the cash flows derived from operating activities
according to the "indirect method".

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on the basis of the conventional historical cost method, except
for the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, in which case the classification and measurement criteria set forth by
IFRS 9 are applied.

## 2.2 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting

The criteria adopted by the Group for defining the scope of consolidation area and the related consolidation principles,
according to IFRS 10, are described below.

###### CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES

The financial position, results and cash flows of Rimini TopCo Group include the financial position, results and cash flows
of Rimini Topco S.p.A. and of the companies over which it has the control. The definition of control is not based solely
on the concept of legal ownership. According to IFRS 10, the definition of control is based on three elements: (a) power
to direct the investee; (b) exposure to or rights on variable returns resulting from involvement with the investee; (c)
capacity to utilize the power to influence the amount of these returns. IFRS 10 stipulates that in order to evaluate
whether it has control over the investee, an investor should focus only on activities that materially affect returns and
rights which are substantial, i.e. can be exercised in practice when important decisions have to be taken with regard to
the investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the
date on which control is acquired until the date that such control ceases to exist. The portions of shareholders’ equity
and profit or loss attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial
position, consolidated income statement, and consolidated statement of comprehensive income.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

The main consolidation principles adopted are as follows:

- the carrying amount of each investment consolidated on a line-by-line basis is eliminated against the related equity,
with the assets, liabilities, income and expense of the subsidiary being added to those of the Parent company,
regardless of the size of the investment; the shares of subsidiaries’ share capital and reserves and of subsidiaries’
profit or loss attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial
position and the consolidated income statement;

- the acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method as provided for by IFRS 3 (see “Business
Combinations”);

- all balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated, as are any profits and losses (unless losses
indicate an impairment of the asset being transferred, requiring recognition) arising from commercial or financial
intragroup transactions not yet realized with third parties;

- any increases or decreases in a subsidiary’s equity arising from its post-acquisition results are recorded upon
elimination in the “Retained earnings (losses)” equity reserve;

- dividends distributed by Group companies are eliminated from the income statement upon consolidation.

In the event of loss of control, the Group will eliminate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any third party
interests, and the other components of equity relative to the subsidiaries. The profit or loss from the loss of control will
be recognized in the profit or loss for the year. Any equity interest maintained in the former subsidiaries are
consolidated at fair value as from the date on which control was lost and, subsequently, is accounted for using the
method reported in the following paragraph “Investments” and cease to be consolidated on the date on which control
is transferred to third parties.

###### CONSOLIDATION OF FOREIGN COMPANIES

The financial statements of each affiliate are prepared in the currency of the economic area they mainly operate in (the
functional currency). All non-Euro assets and liabilities of foreign companies within the scope of consolidation are
translated using the exchange rates as of the reporting date (the current-rate method). Income and expenses are
translated at the average rate for the year. The exchange differences resulting from the use of this approach are
recognized in a dedicated equity reserve in “Other components of comprehensive income” until the disposal of the
investment.

The exchange rates used to translate into Euros the financial statements of companies within the scope of consolidation
are set out in the table below:


**Start-of-period exchange**
**Currency**

**rate**


**Average exchange**

**rate**


**Exchange rate as of**

**period ended December**

**31, 2022**


GBP 0.8403 0.8695 0.8869

PLN 4.5969 4.6832 4.6808

CZK 24.8580 24.2695 24.1160

HUF 369.1900 407.6814 400.8700

###### EQUITY INVESTMENTS 

This item includes equity investments in associates and joint ventures, valued using the equity method, and investments
in other companies valued in accordance with IFRS 9.

Associates are companies over which the Group exercises significant influence, which is presumed to exist when the
Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of the associate company. Associates and joint ventures are


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

initially recorded at cost and are subsequently valued using the equity method. Joint ventures are joint arrangements
whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangements have rights to the net assets of the arrangements.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the results of associates in which its investments
are valued with equity method, from the date that significant influence or joint control is acquired until the date that it
ceases to exist. The Group’s share of unrealized profits from transactions between Group companies is eliminated.
Unrealized losses from transactions between Group companies are eliminated unless they represent actual impairment
of the asset transferred. Losses in excess of shareholders’ equity are accounted for insofar as the investor has a
commitment to the investee to abide by legal or constructive obligations or in any other way to cover its losses.

## 2.3 Valuation Criteria

The most significant accounting principles and valuation criteria used for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements are briefly described below.

###### BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Business combinations in the scope of IFRS 3 are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method, the
consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the
acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group, and the equity instruments
issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in the income statement at the
time they are incurred.

The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is
measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the
acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed. The acquirer can finalize the allocation of fair values to individual assets and liabilities of the acquiree and
recognize new assets and liabilities arising from the business combination, within 12 months from the acquisition date
– the “Purchase Price Allocation” (PPA) process.

If the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the
aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value
of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in the income
statement as a bargain purchase gain.

At the acquisition date, the non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice between the two methods is made on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. Any contingent consideration arrangement in the business combination is measured
at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination in
order to determine goodwill. Subsequent changes in the fair value are recognized in the income statement.

###### TANGIBLE ASSETS

Tangible fixed assets are stated at their original cost of purchase, production or contribution, including directly incurred
accessory costs required to bring an asset into a condition for use. The cost is reduced by accumulated depreciation
and any impairment. Costs for improvements, modernization and transformation incurred after the initial recognition
of the asset acquired or produced internally are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated over their useful life, provided
they derive from separate analytical accounting measurements and when it is probable that the future economic
benefits expected from the asset will increase. Replacement costs of identifiable components of complex assets are
ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated over their useful life. The residual value of the replaced component is ascribed
to the income statement. Maintenance and repair costs are ascribed to the income statement in the year they are
incurred.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of assets, determined on the basis of
the period during which the asset will be used by the company. Land is not depreciated, even if acquired together with
buildings. The depreciation method applied to an asset (including estimate of its useful life) is reviewed at least at each
financial year-end and, if there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future
economic benefits embodied in the asset, the method shall be changed to reflect the changed pattern.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

The Group checks at least once a year if there is any indication that tangible assets have suffered impairment. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment
loss, as described in the section “Impairment” below. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs. An impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the
reasons for previous write-downs no longer exist, the assets are revalued at the lower of the recoverable value and the
previous book value net of depreciation that would have been recorded in the absence of a write-down, with the
adjustment being made on the income statement.

The estimated useful life for the various categories of tangible assets is as follows:

**Category** **Years**

Industrial buildings 40 – 33

Buildings

Small structures 20

General plant and machinery 25 - 5

Plants and machinery

Specific plant and machinery 25 - 5

Industrial and commercial equipment Miscellaneous equipment 5 - 4

Furniture and ordinary office machines 12 - 8

Electronic office machines 6 - 5

Other assets

Means of internal transport 5

Motor vehicles 6 - 4

###### LEASED ASSETS

The Group has entered into lease agreements, mainly relating to buildings, machinery and equipment. The “right of
use” assets and related lease liabilities deriving from a lease according to IFRS 16 are initially measured on the basis of
their present value.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- fixed payments (including fixed payments in substance), net of any lease incentives;

- variable payments based on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate as of the start date;

- the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such option;

- the payment of penalties for early termination; and

- payments due in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the renewal option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be easily determined,
which is generally the case with leases held by the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the
rate that the Group would pay to borrow the funds needed to obtain assets of similar value to the right-of-use asset in
a similar economic environment with similar terms, guarantees and conditions.

The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the entire term of the contract, unless the contract
provides for the transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or the cost of the lease reflects the fact that the
lessee will exercise the purchase option. In this case, the depreciation must be the shorter the useful life of the asset
and the duration of the contract. The estimated useful lives for right-of-use assets are calculated according to the same
criterion applied to owned tangible assets. In addition, the right-of-use asset is decreased by any impairment losses and
adjusted to reflect any remeasurement of the associated lease liability.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

In the statement of financial position, the Group presents right-of-use assets within tangible assets and lease liabilities
within current and non-current borrowings.

In the income statement, interest expense on lease liabilities constitutes a component of financial expenses and is
shown separately from the depreciation of right-of-use assets.

The Group recognizes deferred taxation on right-of-use assets and on lease liabilities in relation to contracts for which
IFRS 16 is applied for the first time. Management has assessed the existing tax legislation and interpreted the accounting
principles applied, concluding the recognition of deferred tax is appropriate.

###### ASSETS / LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE

Assets and liabilities and groups of assets and liabilities whose carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale rather than through continuing use are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the statement of
financial position. These assets and liabilities are classified as “Assets held for sale” and are valued at the lower value
between their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. Profits or losses, net of related tax effects, resulting
from the valuation or sale of these assets and liabilities, are recorded under a dedicated item in the income statement.

###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist of identifiable assets without physical substance which are controlled by the Group and from
which future economic benefits are expected. Intangible assets are recognized when the cost of an asset can be
measured reliably, in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with a definite useful life are measured
at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life, i.e. the estimated period during which the asset will
be used by the Group.

**Category** **Years**

Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights Software licenses 5

Other intangible assets Miscellaneous multi-year charges 12 - 5

Intangible assets with an undefined useful life are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least once a
year, as explained in the “Impairment” section below. An intangible asset is considered to have an undefined useful life
when there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate positive cash flows for
the Group.

###### GOODWILL

Goodwill is classified as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life and is initially recorded at cost, as described
above, and subsequently subjected to an assessment, at least annually, aimed at identifying any losses in value
("impairment test"). The reversal of impairment loss is not permitted, even if the reasons that led to the impairment
cease to exist.

###### IMPAIRMENT 

According to IAS 36, at each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets
with a finite useful life to assess whether there are any signs that these assets may have lost value (impairment
indicators). If any such signs exist, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets to determine the writedown amount (impairment test). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is estimated by taking
into account the provisions contained in accounting standard IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. In estimating the value
in use, expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.
Except for goodwill, when there is no longer any reason for an impairment loss to be recognized, the carrying amount
of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to a new carrying amount based on its estimated recoverable value,
which may not exceed the net carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been
recognized. The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.

Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.

###### DERIVATIVES

According to IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments consist of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and qualify
for hedge accounting only if all of the following apply:

- the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception;

- the hedge is expected to be highly effective;

- effectiveness can be reliably measured;

- the hedge is highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it is designated.

When derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatment applies:

- for a fair-value hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in
the fair value of assets or liabilities yielding or bearing a fixed rate), the derivative instrument is measured at fair
value and any gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. At the same time, the carrying amount of the
hedged assets or liabilities is adjusted to reflect the changes in fair value with respect to the hedged risk;

- for a cash flow hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in
the cash flows of assets or liabilities due to variations in exchange rates), the changes in fair value of the instrument
are initially recognized in a dedicated equity reserve in “Other components of comprehensive income” and are
subsequently reclassified to the income statement in line with the effects of the hedged transaction on profit or
loss.

If hedge accounting cannot be applied, the gains or losses from the fair value measurement of derivative financial
instruments are recognized immediately in the income statement.

###### TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

Trade and other receivables are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be received. Subsequent
adjustments are made to account for any write-downs. Trade and other receivables are subsequently measured at
amortized cost.

###### INVENTORIES

Inventories are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost, determined on a weighted-average basis, and
estimated realizable value, determined from market trends. In the case of raw materials, market value means
replacement cost; for finished goods and semi-finished goods, market value means net realizable value (net of the costs
necessary to make the sale) representing the amount that the Group would expect to obtain from the sale of these
goods as part of its normal business.

###### CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

This item consists of available cash on hand and bank deposits, shares in liquid funds and other highly liquid securities
which can be readily converted into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

###### EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The benefits subsequent to the termination of the employment relationship are based on plans that, depending on
their features, are either defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans, according to IAS 19.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

In defined-contribution plans, such as the TFR (severance pay) accrued after the 2007 Italian Finance Law came into
force, the obligation of the Company, limited to the payment of a contribution to the State, or to an asset or to a
separate legal entity (“fund”), is determined based on contributions owing after any amounts already paid. Definedbenefit plans, such as TFR accrued before the 2007 Italian Finance Law came into force, are plans for benefits
subsequent to the termination of the employment relationship that are a future obligation and for which the Company
bears the relevant actuarial and investment risks. The TFR fund is measured at the actuarial value of the liability of the
Company, in accordance with current legislation and with the national collective and company-specific labor
agreements. The actuarial valuation, based on demographic, financial and turnover assumptions, is entrusted to
independent actuaries. Actuarial gains/ losses are recorded under “Other Components of Comprehensive Income”.

Liabilities for obligations relating to other medium- or long-term benefits to employees, such as jubilee or loyalty
benefits, are determined by adopting actuarial assumptions. The effects deriving from changes in the actuarial
assumptions or from adjustments based on past experience are recognized entirely in the income.

###### PROVISIONS FOR RISKS AND CHARGES

The Group records provisions for risks and charges according to IAS 37 when it has a legal or constructive obligation,
arising from a past event, where it is probable that a cost will be incurred to fulfill that obligation and when a reliable
estimate of the amount can be made.

Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount that, at the reporting date, the Group could reasonably
expect to pay to extinguish the obligation or transfer it to a third party. Provisions for supplementary agents’
commission represent the calculation of liabilities based on actuarial techniques performed by independent actuaries.
Changes in estimates are recognized in the income statement of the period in which the change occurs.

The costs that the Company expects to incur to carry out restructuring plans, in accordance with IAS 37, are recorded
in the financial year in which the Group formally defined such plans and gave to the entities concerned a valid
expectation that the restructuring will take place. The risks where a liability is merely possible are described in the
section “Contingent Liabilities, Commitments and Other Guarantees Given to Third Parties”, but no provision is made.

###### PAYABLES TO BANKS AND OTHER LENDERS

This item includes financial liabilities made up of bank loans, bonds (i.e. senior secured sustainability-linked notes) and
payables to other lenders, including payables arising from finance leases. Payables to banks and other lenders are
measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are initially recognized at cost, represented by the fair value of the
amount received net of accessory loan arrangement charges. After initial recording, loans are subsequently measured
at amortized cost, which is calculated using the effective interest method taking into account issue costs and any
settlement discount or premium.

###### TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES

These liabilities are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be paid. Subsequent measurement is at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.

###### REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues are recognized where it is probable that the Company will obtain the economic benefits associated with the
sale of goods or provision of services, and where the relevant amount can be reliably determined. Revenues are
recorded at the fair value of the consideration received or expected, taking into account any volume of other
commercial discounts and premiums.

As regards the sale of goods, revenues are recognized when the Company has transferred to the purchaser the main
risks and benefits of ownership. As regards the provision of services, revenues are recognized at the time the services
are rendered.

###### GOVERNMENT GRANTS

Government grants, including non-monetary grants valued at fair value, are recognized when there is a reasonable
certainty that they will be received and that the Group will comply with all the conditions envisaged for their
disbursement.

###### TAXES

Current income taxes are based on an estimate of the taxable income for the year and on current legislation in the
countries where the Group operates. The expected liability, net of any payments in advance or withholding tax incurred,
is recognized under “Current taxes”.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability
and its tax base. “Deferred tax liabilities” consist of deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences which will
be taxed in future years in accordance with prevailing tax legislation. “Deferred tax assets” consist of taxes which,
despite being recoverable in future years, refer to the current year and are recognized where it is probable that future
taxable income will be sufficient to absorb their recovery. Deferred tax liabilities were offset by deferred tax assets
where conditions specified in IAS 12 were met, notably where the two items relate to income taxes levied by the same
tax authority and where there is a legally enforceable right to offset in this manner.

Income taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly credited or charged to
shareholders’ equity, in which case the tax effect is recognized directly in that item. Deferred tax assets are recognized
for the carryforward of unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which
the unused tax losses can be used. Reno De Medici S.p.A. and some of its Italian subsidiaries (R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and
R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l.) participated in the national tax consolidation scheme pursuant to Article 117 et seq. of the
Consolidated Income Tax Act (TUIR). Reno De Medici S.p.A. acts as the consolidating company and becomes a single
taxable base for the group of adhering companies, thereby enabling this group to offset taxable income against tax
losses in a single tax return. Each company participating in the national tax consolidation agreement transfers its taxable
income or tax loss to the consolidating company.

The subsidiary RDM Blendecques S.A.S is also part of the national tax consolidation agreement that includes the
subsidiaries R.D.M. Marketing France S.A.S. on the basis of French “Article 223a of the General Tax Code”.

###### DIVIDENDS

Dividends payable by the Group are reported as a change in equity in the period in which they are approved by
shareholders.

###### DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

Financial assets are derecognized when one of the following conditions is met:

- the contractual right to receive the cash flows from the asset has expired;

- the Group has substantially transferred all the risks and benefits associated with the asset, transferred its rights to
receive cash flows from the assets or assumed a contractual obligation to transfer the cash flows received to one
or more potential beneficiaries by virtue of a contract that meets the requirements of the standard ("pass through
_test");_

- the Group has neither transferred nor substantially maintained all the risks and benefits associated with the
financial asset but has ceded control of it.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation is fulfilled,
canceled or prescribed. An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different contractual terms must be
accounted for as an extinction of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly,
a substantial change in the contractual terms of an existing financial liability, even partial, must be accounted for as an
extinction of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.

###### CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Euros using the exchange rate on the reporting date,
with the relevant gain or loss recorded on the income statement.

## 2.4 Estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to apply accounting principles and methods which,
in certain circumstances, are based on difficult and subjective assessments and estimates, on the basis of historical


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable from time to time and realistic according to the relative
circumstances.

The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the financial statements: the
statement of financial position, the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash
flows, and the other information provided. The final outcome of the financial statement items for which the
aforementioned estimates and assumptions have been used may differ from those reported in the financial statements,
which show the effects of the occurrence of the event being estimated, due to the uncertainty that characterizes the
assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.

The areas that require more subjectivity on the part of the Directors in preparing the estimates, and for which a change
in the conditions underlying the assumptions used could have a significant impact on the financial data, are briefly
described below.

a) **Impairment of assets: In accordance with the accounting standards applied by the companies of the Group,**

tangible and intangible assets, and goodwill in particular, are subject to verification in order to ascertain whether
a reduction in value has been incurred, which must be recognized through a write-down, when there are indicators
that suggest difficulties in recovering the related net book value through use. The verification of the existence of
the aforementioned indicators requires the directors to make subjective assessments based on the information
available within the Group companies and on the market, as well as from historical experience. Furthermore, if it
is determined that a potential impairment may have occurred, the companies of the Group proceed with the
determination of the impairment using valuation techniques deemed appropriate. The correct identification of the
elements indicating the existence of a potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, as well as the
estimates for their determination, depend on factors that may vary over time, influencing the assessments and
estimates made by the Directors.

b) **Depreciation and amortization: The cost of tangible and intangible assets with definite useful lives is amortized on**

a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. The useful economic life of these assets is
determined by the Directors when they are purchased. It is based on historical experience for similar assets, market
conditions, and anticipations regarding future events that could have an impact on the useful life of the assets,
including changes in technology. Therefore, the actual economic life may differ from the estimated useful life.

c) **Provisions for risks and charges: Provisions representing the risk of a negative outcome are recognized for legal**

and tax risks. The value of the provisions recorded in the financial statements relating to these risks represents the
best estimate at the date made by the Directors. This estimate involves the adoption of assumptions that depend
on factors which may change over time and could have a significant effect compared to the current estimates made
by the Directors for the preparation of the Group's financial statements.

d) **Provision for doubtful receivables: The provision for doubtful receivables reflects the estimated losses for the**

receivables portfolio. Accruals were made for expected credit losses, estimated on the basis of past experience
with reference to receivables with similar credit risk, current and historical unpaid amounts, as well as careful
monitoring of the quality of the receivables portfolio and current conditions and forecasts of the economy and
reference markets. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of each change are
reflected in the income statement for the year in question.

e) **Deferred taxes assets:** The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is subject to the subsidiaries reporting sufficient

future taxable profits against which the tax losses or the other deferred tax assets can be used. Significant
judgments are required of management to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized in
the financial statements based on the timing and amount of future taxable income.

## 2.5 Recently issued Accounting Standards

The following amendments and interpretations that apply from 1 January 2022 have not had a significant effect on the
Company's financial statements since the adoption of said amendments.

- On 14 May 2020, the IASB issued the document “Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 Cycle” and
published the amendments to IAS 16 “Property, plant and equipment”, IAS 37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and
contingent assets” and IFRS 3 “Business combinations”.

The new standards, amendments and interpretations listed below have been issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (“IASB”) and have been endorsed by the European Union, but since the effective date is after


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

December 31, 2022 and the Group has not elect to early adopt them, these new standards, amendments and
interpretations have not been applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements.

In particular:

- On 25 June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”, which set out the accounting
treatment of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held. The provisions of IFRS 17, which supersede
those currently laid down in IFRS 4 “Insurance Contracts”, are intended to help companies implement the standard
and (i) reduce costs by simplifying the requirements of the standard; (ii) render the posting of disclosures easier in
financial statements; and (iii) facilitate the transition to the new standard by postponing its entry into force. The
changes are effective as of financial years starting on or after 1 January 2023.

- On 12 February 2021, the IASB issued the documents Amendment to IAS 1 – “Disclosure of Accounting Policies”
and Amendment to IAS 8 – “Definition of Accounting Estimates”. The amendments aim to improve disclosure on
accounting policies so as to provide more useful information to investors and other primary users of the financial
statements, as well as to help companies distinguish between changes in accounting estimates and changes in
accounting policy. The changes are effective as of financial years starting on or after 1 January 2023.

- On 7 May 2021, the IASB issued the document Amendment to IAS 12 - “Deferred Tax Related to Assets and
Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction”. The amendments require companies to pay deferred taxes on certain
transactions that, at the time of initial recognition, give rise to taxable and deductible temporary differences of
equal amount. The changes are effective as of financial years starting on or after 1 January 2023.

- On 9 December 2021, the IASB issued the document Amendment to IFRS 17 – “Insurance Contracts: Initial
Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information”. The amendment is a transition option relating to
comparative information on financial assets presented during the first application of IFRS 17. The amendment aims
to help businesses avoid temporary accounting mismatches between the financial assets and liabilities of insurance
contracts, and therefore, to improve the usefulness of comparative information for users of the financial
statements. IFRS 17, which incorporates the amendment, will be effective as of the financial years beginning on or
after 1 January 2023.

At the date of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the competent bodies of the European Union have not yet
completed the endorsement process necessary for the adoption of the following accounting standards and
amendments already issued by IASB. The Group will assess any potential impacts on the Consolidated Financial
Statements when these new principles are approved by the European Union.

In particular:

- On 15 July 2020, the IASB issued the document Amendment to IAS 1 - “Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent – Deferral of Effective Date”, in which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the
amendments was deferred until 1 January 2024.

- On 31 October 2022, the IASB issued the document “Amendment to IAS 1 - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants”.
The amendments are scheduled to enter into force as of 1 January 2024.

- On 22 September 2022, the IASB issued the document Amendment to IFRS 16 “Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and
Leaseback”, the amendments are scheduled to enter into force as of 1 January 2024.

# 3. RISK MANAGEMENT

The activities of the Group’s operating companies are exposed to the following risks: market risk (including exchange
rate risk, commodity risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.

The Group’s risk management strategy is aimed at minimizing potential negative effects on the financial performance
of Group companies (in particular the operating companies). Risk management is centralized in the treasury function
which identifies, assesses and performs financial risk hedges. The treasury function provides indications for monitoring
risk management, as well as providing indications for specific areas, concerning interest rate risk and the use of
derivative and non-derivative instruments.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

#### EXCHANGE RATE RISK

The Group’s functional currency is the Euro. The exposure to exchange rate risk relates to sales, purchases, receivables,
current accounts, borrowings and loans expressed in currencies other than the functional currency, mainly in USD and
GBP. In terms of exposure to currency risk, in 2022 the Group managed the marginal imbalance between investments
and funds in the same currency by using a natural-hedging approach and by carefully and continually monitoring market
conditions; as a result, it was not deemed necessary to resort to hedging derivatives.

As of December 31, 2022, there are no derivative instruments held to hedge currency risk.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the Group’s profit and loss to the fluctuations in exchange rates versus the
functional currency:

#### COMMODITY RISK

The commodity risk mainly refers to the movements of the prices of the raw materials that are purchased for production
and the margins that are influenced by the possibility of reversing the trend of the prices of energy and raw materials
on the prices of the products sold. Most contractual relationships with customers involve a transfer of the price risk of


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

the raw materials to the customer. In order to mitigate the price risk where the transfer is not foreseen, the price lists
with customers are reviewed on a quarterly basis.

More in detail, the nature of the Group’s business involves exposure to fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural
gas and certain chemical products derived from petroleum (such as latexes) and fibrous raw materials. Natural gas
supply contracts are usually agreed for total requirements at a fixed price and are negotiated at least three months
before the supply period, but sometimes for longer periods in relation to the supply period. Electricity is purchased
partly at a fixed price, and partially indexed according to the values of continental electricity markets as published by
the bodies responsible for these markets. In order to contain possible price pressure on raw materials, the Group aims
to diversify its suppliers and its supply markets.

As of the date of the statement of financial position there are no derivative instruments held to commodity risk.

#### INTEREST RATE RISK

Interest rate risk mainly refers to the Group’s exposure to changes in cash flows due to fluctuation in market interest
rates, with particular reference to the interest expense outflows paid on financial debt.

As of December 31, 2022, over 90% of the Group's financial debt is composed of the Floating Rate Senior Secured
Sustainability-linked Notes which substantially bear interest cost at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (with a 0%
floor) plus 5.25% per annum, reset quarterly.

The following tables break out long term debt into fixed and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

_(*) In connection with the release from escrow to the Company of the net proceeds of the Senior Secured Sustainability-_
_linked Notes, both the Rimini Bidco Loan amounting to €285 million and €138.6 million (book value amounting to €136.7_
_million) of long term financing outstanding at RDM level have been repaid on January 13, 2022, also due to change in_
_control clauses included into long term financing arrangements outstanding as of the acquisition date._

The description and details on long term financial debt is contained in the following Note 23 relating to "Current and
Non-Current payables to banks and other lenders".

The Group remains exposed to residual interest rate risk for the bank loans that are held for which the uncovered
variable rate financial debt represents an element of risk of impact that could occur on the income statement and on
cash flows as a result of an increase in market interest rates. However, the total and long-term exposure to bank
borrowings is limited to only €2.8 million as of December 31, 2022.

The main exposure to interest rate risk derives from the Floating Rate Senior Secured Sustainability-linked Notes. The
Group has decided not to hedge the financial liability to mitigate this exposure. An increase or reduction of 25 basis
points in 3M Euribor rates would result in an increase/decrease of finance expense of €890 thousand in 2023 and €4.2
million over the residual maturity of the Notes.

The Notes also include a step-up feature: from June 15, 2026 the interest rate will increase by 0.5%, 1.0% or 1.5%
depending on whether respectively, one, two or three of the Sustainability Performance Targets defined in the Offering
Memorandum are not achieved. Considering the actions put in place by the management and the potential change in
the perimeter of the Group companies included in the valuation of the targets, as a result of M&A transactions either
already realized and forecasted, the management does not see any critical element that could impair the ability of the
Group to achieve all three targets by 2025. The company has therefore not revised its estimate of payments and
accordingly not included the step-up feature in the amortized cost of the Notes.

**IBOR REFORM**

A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of
some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk‑free rates (referred to as ‘IBOR reform’).

With respect to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate – Euribor, during 2019 the calculation methodology changed and in
July 2019 the European Money Markets Institute was granted authorization for administration of Euribor under the
European Union Benchmarks Regulation by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority. The European
Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) substituted the Belgian FSMA on January 1, 2022.

This allows market participants to continue to use Euribor for both existing and new contracts. The Group expects that
Euribor will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future.

###### CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is essentially derived from receivables from customers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced
mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 (continued)**

influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which
customers operate.

To mitigate the credit risk related to commercial counterparties, and therefore domestic and foreign customers, the
Group's operating companies have put in place procedures aimed at ensuring that product sales are made to customers
who are deemed reliable according to the Group’s standard payment and delivery conditions.

This risk, which takes the form of the possibility that the counterparty does not fulfill its contractual obligations, is
mitigated through constant monitoring of each Group company’s commercial exposure and the collection times of
receivables.

The amount of financial assets considered of doubtful recoverability is not significant; in any case it is covered by
appropriate allocations to the provision for doubtful receivables. See Note 19 for more details about the provision for
doubtful receivables.

Allowance for doubtful accounts 44 425 134 4,432 5,035

###### LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity risk is associated with the Group’s ability to meet commitments arising mainly from financial liabilities. A
prudent management of the liquidity risk arising from normal operations implies the maintenance of an adequate level
of cash and the availability of funds obtainable through an adequate amount of credit lines.

The following table shows the expected cash flows (principal and interest) in the coming years related to the liabilities
shown below as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

###### CAPITAL RISK

The Group's objective in capital risk management is mainly to safeguard business continuity so as to guarantee returns
to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders. The Group also sets itself the goal of maintaining an optimal capital
structure in order to reduce the cost of debt.

###### FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY CATEGORY

Trade receivables and other financial assets, payables to suppliers, other liabilities and loans recorded under "current"
items in the statement of financial position are measured using the amortized cost method. As these are assets
underlying trading relationships whose settlement is expected in the short term, their fair value does not differ from
their book values in the financial statements as of December 31, 2022.

Non-current financial liabilities and assets are regulated or valued at market rates and it is therefore deemed that their
fair value is essentially in line with the current accounting values.

Below is a classification of financial assets and liabilities by category of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

**Total liabilities** **1,174,347** **1,655** **41,810** **1,217,812**

Long term non-current borrowings include the Floating Rate Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes issued by Reno
De Medici S.p.A. at a nominal amount of €445.0 million. The Notes pay interest at a variable rate of three-month
EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus 5.25% per annum, that is different from the average interest rate already existing at
RDM Group level. Both Notes are traded on the Euro MTF (multilateral trading facility) segment of the Luxembourg
stock exchange.

As of December 31, 2022, the Notes have a carrying amount at amortized cost of €434.4 million; their last market price
quoted on Euro MTF on December 23, 2022 was 89.25%, therefore their fair value (measured as a level 1 fair value) as
of December 31, 2022 is €397.2 million.

The fair values of the remaining borrowings are not materially different from their carrying amounts, since the interest
payable on those borrowings is aligned to current market rates or the borrowings are of a short-term nature.

Disclosures of fair value are not required for lease liabilities, in accordance with IFRS7 paragraph 29.

###### FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE

The fair value of financial instruments listed on an active market is based on market prices as of the statement of
financial position date.

The fair value of instruments that are not listed on an active market is determined using valuation techniques based on
a series of methods and assumptions related to market conditions at the statement of financial position date, including:
current or recent quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active; or, a net present value
calculated using discount rates derived from quoted yields of instruments with similar maturity and credit rating that
are traded in active markets, adjusted by an illiquidity factor.

As of December 31, 2022, the Group did not hold any interest derivative instruments and any foreign-exchange
derivative instruments, nor any other financial assets or financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and
loss or at fair value through other comprehensive income.

# 4. OPERATING SEGMENTS

The disclosure regarding operating segments is provided in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating segments” (hereafter
“IFRS 8”), which defines an operating segment as a component of an entity that: i) engages in business activities from
which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other
components of the same entity); ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating
decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and iii)
for which discrete financial information is available.

The Group has determined that it has only one reportable segment (“Recycled Board”) based on the information
reviewed by its Chief Operating Decision Maker, defined as the Board of Directors of the Company, in making decisions
regarding allocation of resources and to assess performance.

# 5. PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION

The changes in the financial data at December 31, 2022 were affected by the fact that the consolidation as of December
31, 2021 only included the last two months of the financial year because Rimini TopCo S.p.A. acquired the former Reno
De Medici Group on October 26, 2021.

Additionally, the Purchase Price Allocation of Rimini TopCo over the acquired assets and liabilities of RDM Group, which
at the date of acquisition was recorded based on provisional values and estimates, as allowed by IFRS 3, was completed
in 2022.

Specifically, the completion of this valuation process involved a reduction in the goodwill for an amount of €264.7
million, an increase in the value of tangible fixed assets equal to €265.9 million and an increase in the value of intangible
fixed assets equal to €94.6 million; in addition, deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for €99.5 million. As a result,
the comparative values, relating to the financial information as of December 31, 2021, were restated on the basis of
the definitive estimates.

The table below contains the reconciliation of the restated statement of financial position and income statement data
with those published in the previous year.

# 6. REVENUES FROM SALES

Revenues from sales amounted to €1,222.3 million, compared to €169.4 million of the previous year. Of the €1,053
million increase, the variation of €1,074.3 million is mainly attributable to the change in consolidation perimeter.

The 2022 revenues have been characterized by increases in sales prices partially offset by decreases in volumes due to
the Blendecques and Villa Santa Lucia mills production shutdown. These shutdowns are respectively due to a fire
occurred at Blendecques mill in March 2022 and to the stop of the external water treatment plant at Villa Santa Lucia
mill, due to causes not under control of Reno De Medici. The production in Villa Santa Lucia mill restarted in January
2023, while Blendecques mill will gradually resume operations in 2023.

Reduction of discount rate -0.25% 5,841 -0.20% 14,700 -0.25% 1,919

The sensitivity analysis reported above is carried out based on changes in individual assumptions, maintaining the other
assumptions unchanged, although in practice any changes in an assumption can generally be reflected in the others
due to potential correlations. The sensitivity analysis reported above was calculated using the same method (projected
unit credit method) used to define the valuation of the liability recorded in the statement of financial position.

Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to certain risks, the most significant of which are
described below.

###### Discounting and inflation rate risk

The present value of defined benefit pension plans is calculated using a discount rate determined using high quality
corporate bond yields. A decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in the liability. A decrease in the
inflation rate would result in a decrease in the liability.

###### Probability of resignations 

The present value of defined benefit pension plans is calculated using the best estimate of resignations. An increase in
the rate of resignations and advances would result in an increase in the liability.

##### Independent auditor’s report
_in accordance with article 14 of Legislative Decree No. 39 of 27 January 2010_

To the shareholders of Reno De Medici SpA


###### Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements


**_Opinion_**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Reno De Medici Group (the Group), which
comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2021, the consolidated
statement of income, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of
changes in shareholders’ equity, consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position
of the Group as of 31 December 2021, and of the result of its operations and cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia).
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for
_the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this report. We are independent of_
Reno De Medici SpA (the Company) pursuant to the regulations and standards on ethics and
independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian law. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**_Other Matters_**

The consolidated financial statements of Reno De Medici Group for the year ended 31 December
2020 were audited by another auditor who expressed an opinion without modification on 7 April
2021 on these consolidated financial statements.


-----

**_Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the_**
**_Consolidated Financial Statements_**

The directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true
and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union and, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as they determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, in
preparing the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriate application of the going concern
basis of accounting, and for disclosing matters related to going concern. In preparing the consolidated
financial statements, the directors use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend
to liquidate Reno De Medici SpA or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The board of statutory auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, the
Group’s financial reporting process.

**_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
consolidated financial statements.

As part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia),
we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit.
Furthermore:

- We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures
responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

- We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

- We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;

- We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.


-----

However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern;

- We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

- We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated
financial statements.

We communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required
by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified
during our audit.


###### Report on Compliance with other Laws and Regulations


**_Opinion in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 2, letter e), of Legislative Decree_**
**_No. 39/10_**

The directors of Reno De Medici SpA are responsible for preparing a report on operations of the Reno
De Medici Group as of 31 December 2021, including its consistency with the relevant consolidated
financial statements and its compliance with the law.

We have performed the procedures required under auditing standard (SA Italia) No. 720B in order to
express an opinion on the consistency of the report on operations with the consolidated financial
statements of the Reno De Medici Group as of 31 December 2021 and on its compliance with the law,
as well as to issue a statement on material misstatements, if any.

In our opinion, the report on operations is consistent with the consolidated financial statements of
Reno De Medici Group as of 31 December 2021 and is prepared in compliance with the law.

With reference to the statement referred to in article 14, paragraph 2, letter e), of Legislative Decree
No. 39/10, issued on the basis of our knowledge and understanding of the Company and its
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have nothing to report.

# STRUCTURE AND CONTENT

Reno De Medici S.p.A. is a company which is established as a legal entity under Italian law. The RDM Group operates
mainly in Europe and is involved in the production and distribution of packaging cardboard from recycled fibre.
Distribution and sale operations are carried out through a network of agents and the internal sales force under the
subsidiary R.D.M Marketing Group.

On October 26, 2021, Rimini BidCo S.p.A., an affiliate of the Apollo Global Management, Inc. fund, announced that it
had finalized the purchase of approximately 67% of the share capital of Reno De Medici S.p.A. from the Company’s two
largest shareholders - Cascades Canada ULC and Caisse de dépot et placement du Québec - at a price of 1.45 euro per
share. The legal requirements having been met, Rimini BidCo S.p.A. launched a mandatory full takeover bid, whose
acceptance period ended on December 17, 2021. In view of the final results of the takeover bid, the joint procedure
concerning the ordinary shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. still outstanding has been started. The procedure was
completed on December 29, 2021, the date on which the ordinary shares of Reno De Medici S.p.A. were delisted from
Euronext Milano and the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges.

Reno De Medici S.p.A. has its registered office in Milan, Italy. The consolidated financial statements of the RDM Group
were approved by the Board of Directors of Reno De Medici S.p.A. on March 14, 2022.

The consolidated financial statements of the RDM Group are presented in euro (rounded to the nearest thousand), as
this is the prevailing currency in the countries where the Group carries out most of its activities. Subsidiaries are included
in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the principles described in the section “Accounting Principles”.

The 2021 consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and approved by the European Union, and
on the basis of provisions issued to implement Article 9 of Legislative Decree 38/205. IFRS also includes all revised
international accounting standards (“IAS”), all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (“IFRIC”), including those previously issued by the Standing Interpretations Committee (“SIC”).

The RDM Group applied the same accounting principles as for the Annual Financial Report at December 31, 2020.

Please note that, in order to provide a better representation of the events that occurred during the period under review,
some of the criteria used to present the balance sheet data contained in these financial statements as of December 31,
2021 have been modified with respect to those used in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020.As a result,
the balance sheet figures at December 31, 2020 have also been adjusted to make them comparable with those at
December 31, 2021. In particular, CO2 emission rights have been included in “intangible assets” and the related debt
to the ETS (“Emission trading system”) has been entered under “other payables”.

###### ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET APPLICABLE, AS THEY ARE NOT APPROVED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION

  - Amendments to IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts), initial application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – comparative
information;

  - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of liabilities as current or noncurrent;

  - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of

The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis with the exception of derivative financial instruments
and financial assets held for sale, which are recognized at fair value, and financial liabilities, which are recognized at
amortized cost. The carrying amount of hedged assets and liabilities which are qualified for hedge accounting is
adjusted to take into account changes in the fair value due to hedged risks.

The financial statements were prepared with clarity and truthfully and accurately represent the RDM Group’s results,
assets and liabilities, and cash flows. The financial statements were prepared on the going-concern assumption.

Preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the IFRS may require the use of specific estimates
and valuations, as well as management’s reasonable judgment in applying accounting policies. More complex matters
and/or those that require greater use of assumptions and estimates are discussed in the section “Estimates and
Valuations”.

The Group has chosen to present the structure and content of its consolidated financial statements in the following
manner:

  - the consolidated statement of financial position is presented with separate sections for assets, liabilities and
shareholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities are then presented on the basis of their classification as current,
non-current or held for sale;

  - the consolidated income statement is presented in a vertical format with items broken down by nature, as
this provides reliable and more relevant information than a classification by function;

  - the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is presented separately from the consolidated income
statement, and each item is shown net of the tax effect;

  - the consolidated statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method;

  - the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity is presented by showing separately the profit
or loss for the year and any income and expense recognized directly in equity and not in the income
statement, in accordance with specific IAS/IFRS requirements. It also shows separately the transactions with
shareholders.

## Scope of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries, from the date on which
control is acquired until the date that such control ceases to exist.

The accounting period and the reporting date of the consolidated financial statements correspond to those of the
Parent company and of all the entities included in the scope of consolidation.

It should be noted that as at December 31, 2021 the scope of consolidation has changed due to the completion of the
following sales and acquisitions transactions:

On July 1, 2021, the row group finalized the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of four companies under Spanish
law by the subsidiary RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. The acquisition was aimed at one of the main European players
in the coated cardboard sector, Papelera del Principado S.A. and three smaller companies operating in related
businesses, Ondupacart S.A., Cogeneracio del Pla S.A., Fergerdell S.L. The final price paid for the acquisition is equal to
8.7 million euro, entirely financed by the RDM Group through the use of its own financial sources.

The net carrying amount of the acquired assets is as follows:

**(thousands of euros)** **Value at acquisition date**

Tangible fixed assets 29,707

**Badwill** **8,842**

**Total price paid** **8,723**

The provisional badwill, amounting to 8.8 million euro, resulting from the acquisition of Paprinsa, due to the difference
between the price paid, amounting to 8.7 million euro, and the net assets acquired, amounting to 17.6 million euro,
was recorded in the income statement under "Income and expense from equity investments." Any adjustments
resulting from the completion of the valuation process at the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired are
recognized within twelve months of the date of acquisition.

For the purposes of the acquisition, the RoW Group incurred acquisition costs of 0.7 million euro.

The details of the liquidity related to the acquisition are as follows:

**(thousands of euros)**

Consideration paid for the acquisition 8,723

Liabilities assumed
**Total consideration** **8,723**

On July 13, Reno De Medici S.p.A. finalized the agreement for the purchase of 100% of the share capital of the Dutch
company Fineska B.V., holding company of the "Eska" group. The final price paid, after all the adjustments provided for
in the contract, amounts to 147 million euro, of which 7.1 million euro was paid into an escrow account to guarantee
potential liabilities. The acquisition was financed via external financing for a total of 100 million euro and using, for the
remaining part, cash on hand at the date of closing.

The net carrying amount of the acquired assets is as follows:

**(thousands of euros)** **Value at acquisition date**

Tangible fixed assets 52,636

**Total price paid** **146,958**


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

The provisional goodwill resulting from the acquisition, amounting to 86.6 million euro, is attributable to the high
profitability of the acquired business and the synergies expected to be achieved by the integration of Fineska B.V. into
the existing group. Any adjustments resulting from the completion of the valuation process at the fair value of the assets
and liabilities acquired are recognized within twelve months of the date of acquisition.

For the purposes of the acquisition, the RoW Group incurred acquisition costs of 1.5 million euro.

Below are details of the liquidity related to the acquisition:

**(thousands of euros)**

Consideration paid for the acquisition 46,958

Liabilities assumed 100,000

**Total consideration** **146,958**

On April 30, 2021, the RDM Group finalized, through its subsidiary RDM Blendecques S.A.S, the agreement for the sale
of 100% of the share capital of the French-registered company R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S. to the company Bonaparte
Holding S.A.S, 100% owned by Mutares SE & Co. KgaA.

The final sale price, already including post-closing adjustments, was 12.3 million euro. In addition, the contract provides
for a variable "earn-out" price component, on the higher EBITDA that will be realized, compared to the reference
EBITDA, in the next three years. The situation as at December 31, 2021 includes the earn-out receivable of 2.9 million
euro, of which 1.2 million euro is the current portion and 1.7 million euro the non-current portion.

It should also be noted that part of the final sales price will be paid in the form of a vendor loan granted by the subsidiary
RDM Blendecques S.A.S to the aforementioned Bonaparte Holding S.A.S. The total value of the vendor loan measured
at amortized cost, which matures within three years of completion of the transaction, amounts to 6.5 million euro, of
which 2.2 million euro is the current portion and 4.3 million euro the non-current portion.

The final sale price, including the estimated "earn-out", resulted in a loss of 1.7 million euro as of December 31, 2021
in addition to the impairment loss of 3.7 million euro that had already been recorded in the financial statements as of
December 31, 2020 in order to align the carrying amount of the La Rochette CGU with its estimated realizable value.

It should be noted that the sale of R.D.M. Rochette S.A.S. has involved the withdrawal of the RDM Group from the FBB
– Folding Box Board segment (cardboard for folding cartons obtained with virgin fibers) and therefore the related results
of operations as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, have been reclassified to the single line item in the
statement of income, "Discontinued operations."

## Accounting principales

###### Consolidation principales

The balance sheet, income statement and financial situation of the RDM Group includes the balance sheet, income
statement and financial situation of Reno De Medici S.p.A. and the companies it controls. The definition of control is
not based solely on the concept of legal ownership. According to IFRS 10, the definition of control is based on three
elements: (a) power over the entity being invested in; (b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with
it; and (c) ability to use power to influence the amount of such returns. IFRS 10 requires that an investor, in assessing
whether he has control over the entity being invested in, focuses on the activities that significantly affect the returns of
the entity and requires that, in assessing the existence of control, only substantial rights be considered, i.e., those that
are exercisable in practice when material decisions are to be made about the entity being invested in. The financial
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is
acquired until the date that such control ceases to exist. The portions of shareholders’ equity and profit or loss
attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated
income statement, and consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The main consolidation principles adopted are as follows:

- for consolidated equity investments, the book value of the individual consolidated investments is eliminated
against the related shareholders' equity, and the assets, liabilities, costs and revenues of the subsidiary


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

undertakings are recorded, regardless of the size of the investment held; the minority interest in the capital and
reserves of consolidated subsidiaries and the minority interest in the net income or loss of consolidated subsidiaries
are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement;

- acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for by the purchase method, as provided for by IFRS 3 (see paragraph
"Business combinations");

- all balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated, as are any profits and losses (unless losses
indicate an impairment of the asset being transferred, requiring recognition) arising from commercial or financial
intragroup transactions not yet realized with third parties;

- any increases or decreases in a subsidiary’s equity arising from its post-acquisition results are recorded upon
elimination in the “Retained earnings (losses)” equity reserve;

- dividends distributed by Group companies are eliminated from the income statement upon consolidation.

- In the event of loss of control, the Group will eliminate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any third
party interests, and the other components of equity relative to the subsidiaries. The profit or loss from the loss of
control will be recognized in the profit or loss for the year. Any equity interest maintained in the former subsidiary will
be measured at fair value on the date that control is lost. It is subsequently valued according to the method described
in the paragraph "Investments" below.

###### CONSOLIDATION OF FOREIGN COMPANIES

The financial statements of each affiliate are prepared in the currency of the economic area they mainly operate in (the
functional currency).

All non-Euro assets and liabilities of foreign companies within the scope of consolidation are converted using the
exchange rates as of the reporting date (the current-rate method). Income and expenses are translated at the average
rate for the year. The exchange differences resulting from the use of this approach are recognized in a dedicated equity
reserve in “Other components of comprehensive income” until the disposal of the investment.

The exchange rates used to translate the financial statements of companies within the scope of consolidation into euro
are outlined in the table below.


**Start-of-period exchange**
**Currency**

**rate**


**Average exchange**

**rate**


**Exchange rate as of**

**period ended December**

**31, 2021**


GBP 0.8990 0.8487 0.8403

PLN 4.5597 4.6137 4.5969

CZK 26.2420 25.2456 24.8580

HUF 363.89 367.4991 369.19

###### EQUITY INVESTMENTS

This item includes investments in associated companies and companies subject to joint control, valued with the equity
method, and investments in other businesses valued in accordance with IFRS 9.

Associates are companies over which the Group exercises significant influence, which is presumed to exist when the
Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.

Joint ventures are companies which feature a joint control agreement in which the participants have a right to a portion
of the net assets or the economic results arising from the agreement.

The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the results of associates in which its investments
are valued with equity method, from the date that significant influence or joint control is acquired until the date that it
ceases to exist. The Group’s share of unrealized profits from transactions between Group companies is eliminated.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

Unrealized losses from transactions between Group companies are eliminated unless they represent actual impairment
of the asset sold.

Losses in excess of shareholders’ equity are accounted for insofar as the investor has a commitment to the investee to
abide by legal or constructive obligations or in any other way to cover its losses.

###### BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. Under this method, the consideration transferred
in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of
the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control
of the acquiree. Incidental transaction costs are recognized in the income statement as they are incurred.

The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest
in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed. If the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds
the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair
value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in the
income statement as a bargain purchase gain.

At the acquisition date, non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice between the two methods is made on a
transaction-by-transaction basis.

Any contingent consideration arrangement in the business combination is measured at its acquisition-date fair value
and included as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination in order to determine goodwill.
Subsequent changes in the fair value are recognized in the income statement.

###### TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS

Tangible fixed assets are stated at their original cost of purchase, production or contribution, including directly incurred
accessory costs required to bring an asset into a condition for use. Cost is reduced by accumulated depreciation and
any impairment.

Costs for improvements, modernization and transformation incurred after the initial recognition of the asset acquired
or produced internally are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across their useful life, provided they derive from
separate analytical accounting measurements and when it is probable that the future economic benefits expected from
the asset will increase.

Replacement costs of identifiable components of complex assets are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across
their useful life. The residual value of the replaced component is ascribed to the income statement. Maintenance and
repair costs are ascribed to the income statement in the year they are incurred.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of assets, determined on the basis of
the period during which the asset will be used by the company. Land is not depreciated, even if acquired together with
buildings.

The useful life applied to each category for the purpose of amortization and depreciation is highlighted below:

**Category** **Years**

Industrial buildings 40 – 33

Buildings

Small structures 20

General plant and machinery 25 - 5

Plants and machinery

Specific plant and machinery 25 - 5


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

Industrial and commercial equipment Miscellaneous equipment 5 - 4

Furniture and ordinary office machines 12 - 8

Electronic office machines 6 - 5

Other assets

Means of internal transport 5

Motor vehicles 6 - 4

The Group checks at least once a year if there is any indication that tangible assets have suffered impairment. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment
loss, as described in the section “Impairment” below.

Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

An impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for
previous write-downs no longer exist, the assets are revalued at the lower of the recoverable value and the previous
book value net of depreciation that would have been recorded in the absence of a write-down, with the adjustment
being made on the income statement.

###### RIGHTS OF USE

"Rights of use" is recorded under assets on the effective lease date, which is the date a lessor makes the underlying
asset available to the lessee. This item is initially measured at cost and includes the initial measurement of the financial
liability for leased assets. The Right of Use is systematically amortized each financial year on the basis of the contractual
duration. The commencement of amortization occurs on the effective date of the lease.

###### ASSETS/LIABILITIES HELD FOR THE SALE

Assets and liabilities and groups of assets and liabilities whose carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale rather than through continuing use are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the statement of
financial position. These assets and liabilities are classified as “Assets held for sale” and are valued at the lower value
between their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. Profits or losses, net of related tax effects, resulting
from the valuation or sale of these assets and liabilities, are recorded under a dedicated item in the income statement.

###### INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS

Intangible assets consist of identifiable assets without physical substance which are controlled by the Group and from
which future economic benefits are expected.

Intangible assets are recognized when the cost of an asset can be measured reliably, in accordance with IAS 38
Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets with a definite useful life are measured at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
life, i.e. the estimated period during which the asset will be used by the Group.

The useful life applied to each category for the purpose of amortization and depreciation is highlighted below:

**Category** **Years**

Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights Software licenses 5

Other intangible assets Miscellaneous multi-year charges 12 - 5

Intangible assets with an undefined useful life are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least once a
year, as explained in the “Impairment” section below. An intangible asset is considered to have an undefined useful life


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

when there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate positive cash flows for
the Group.

###### IMPAIRMENT

At each balance sheet reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets with
a finite useful life to assess whether there are any signs that these assets may have lost value (impairment indicators).
If any such signs exist, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets to determine the write-down amount
(impairment test). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value is estimated taking into
account the provisions in accounting standard IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

In estimating the value in use, expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a post-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.

When an impairment loss recognized in previous years for an asset other than goodwill no longer has a reason to be
maintained, the book value of the asset (or of a cash generating unit) is increased to the new book value resulting from
the estimate of its recoverable value, but not beyond the net book value that the asset would have had if the
impairment loss had not been recognized. The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.

Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.

###### DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Derivative instruments consist of assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

In accordance with IAS 39, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting only if all of the following apply:

- the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception;

- the hedge is expected to be highly effective;

- effectiveness can be reliably measured;

- the hedge is highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it is designated.

When derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatment applies:

- for a fair-value hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in
the fair value of assets or liabilities yielding or bearing a fixed rate), the derivative instrument is measured at fair
value and any gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. At the same time, the carrying amount of the
hedged assets or liabilities is adjusted to reflect the changes in fair value with respect to the hedged risk;

- for a cash flow hedge (e.g. where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in
the cash flows of assets or liabilities due to variations in exchange rates), the changes in fair value of the instrument
are initially recognized in a dedicated equity reserve in “Other components of comprehensive income” and are
subsequently reclassified to the income statement in line with the effects of the hedged transaction on profit or
loss.

If hedge accounting is not applied, gains or losses arising from the fair value measurement of the derivative instrument
are immediately recognized in the income statement.

###### TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

Trade and other receivables are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be received. Subsequent
adjustments are made to account for any write-downs. With regard to receivables and other receivables, the amortized
cost method is used for their subsequent measurement.

###### INVENTORIES


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

Inventories are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost, determined on a weighted-average basis, and
estimated realizable value, determined from market trends.

In the case of raw materials, market value means replacement cost; for finished goods and semi-finished goods, market
value means net realizable value (net of the costs necessary to make the sale) representing the amount that the Group
would expect to obtain from the sale of these goods as part of its normal business.

###### CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

This item consists of available cash on hand and bank deposits, shares in liquid funds and other highly liquid securities
which can be readily converted into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

###### EPLOYEE BENEFITS

The benefits subsequent to the termination of the employment relationship are based on plans that, depending on
their features, are either defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans.

In defined-contribution plans, such as the TFR (severance pay) accrued after the 2007 Italian Finance Law came into
force, the obligation of the Company, limited to the payment of a contribution to the State, or to an asset or to a
separate legal entity (“fund”), is determined based on contributions owing after any amounts already paid.

Defined-benefit plans, such as TFR accrued before the 2007 Italian Finance Law came into force, are plans for benefits
subsequent to the termination of the employment relationship that are a future obligation and for which the Company
bears the relevant actuarial and investment risks. The TFR fund is measured at the actuarial value of the liability of the
Company, in accordance with current legislation and with the national collective and company-specific labor
agreements. The actuarial valuation, based on demographic, financial and turnover assumptions, is entrusted to
independent actuaries. Actuarial gains/losses are recorded under "Other Comprehensive Income".

###### PROVISIONS FOR RISK AND CHARGES

The Group records provisions for risks and charges when it has a legal or constructive obligation, arising from a past
event, where it is probable that a cost will be incurred to fulfill that obligation and when a reliable estimate of the
amount can be made. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount that, at the reporting date, the Group
could reasonably expect to pay to extinguish the obligation or transfer it to a third party.

Provisions for supplementary agents’ commission represent the calculation of liabilities based on actuarial techniques
performed by independent actuaries.

Changes in estimates are recognized in the income statement of the period in which the change occurs.

The costs that the company expects to incur in order to implement restructuring programs, as defined in IAS 37, are
recorded in the period in which the Group has formally defined the program and has generated a valid expectation in
the parties concerned that the restructuring will take place.

The risks where a liability is merely possible are described in the section “Contingent Liabilities, Commitments and Other
Guarantees Given to Third Parties”, but no provision is made.

###### PAYABLES TO BANK AND OTHER LENDERS

This item includes financial liabilities made up of bank loans, bonds and payables to other lenders, including payables
arising from finance leases. Payables to banks and other lenders are measured at amortized cost.

Financial liabilities are initially recognized at cost, represented by the fair value of the amount received net of accessory
loan arrangement charges. After initial recording, loans are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is
calculated using the effective interest method taking into account issue costs and any settlement discount or premium.

###### TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES

These liabilities are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be paid. Subsequent measurement is at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.

###### REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues are recognized where it is probable that the Company will obtain the economic benefits associated with the
sale of goods or provision of services, and where the relevant amount can be reliably determined. Revenues are


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

recorded at the fair value of the consideration received or expected, taking into account any volume of other
commercial discounts and premiums.

As regards the sale of goods, revenues are recognized when the Company has transferred to the purchaser the main
risks and benefits of ownership.

As regards the provision of services, revenues are recognized at the time the services are rendered.

###### TAXES

Current income taxes are based on an estimate of the taxable income for the year and on current legislation in the
countries where the Group operates. The expected liability, net of any payments in advance or withholding tax incurred,
is recognized under “Current taxes”.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability
and its tax base.

“Deferred tax liabilities” consist of deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences which will be taxed in
future years in accordance with prevailing tax legislation.

“Deferred tax assets” consist of taxes which, despite being recoverable in future years, refer to the current year and are
recognized where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to absorb their recovery.

Deferred tax liabilities were offset by deferred tax assets where conditions specified in IAS 12 were met, notably where
the two items relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and where there is a legally enforceable right to
offset in this manner.

Income taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly credited or charged to
shareholders’ equity, in which case the tax effect is recognized directly in that item.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for the carry-forward of unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable
income will be available against which the unused tax losses can be used.

Reno De Medici S.p.A. and some of its Italian subsidiaries (R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l.) participated
in the national tax consolidation scheme pursuant to Article 117 et seq. of the Consolidated Income Tax Act (TUIR). The
Company acts as the consolidating company and becomes a single taxable base for the group of adhering companies,
thereby enabling this group to offset taxable income against tax losses in a single tax return. Each company participating
in the domestic tax consolidation transfers tax income (taxable income or tax loss) to the consolidating company.

The subsidiary RDM Blendecques S.A.S also draws up a tax consolidation that includes the subsidiary R.D.M. Marketing
France S.A.S. on the basis of French “Article 223a of the General Tax Code”.

###### FOREIGN EXCHANGE DIFFERENCES

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euro using the exchange rate on the reporting date,
with the relevant gain or loss recorded on the income statement.

###### TREASURY SHARES

The treasury shares repurchased are recognized at cost and deducted from the shareholders’ equity. The purchase, sale
or cancellation of treasury shares does not give rise to any profit or loss in the income statement.

###### EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share are defined as the ratio between the Group’s result for the period attributable to the shares
and the weighted number of shares outstanding during the financial year.

Diluted earnings per share are calculated by taking into account the effect of all the potential ordinary shares with
dilutive effect. In the case of the RDM Group, this is equal to the basic earnings per share.

###### FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

With regard to the disclosure document required by IFRS 7 tenet “Financial Instruments: Supplementary Information”,
which requires extensive disclosures about the nature of credit, liquidity and market risks and how these risks are


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

managed, reference is made to the “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” section of the Explanatory Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

###### ESTIMATES AND VALUATIONS

The preparation of the financial statements and the related notes in accordance with IFRS requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date. The estimates and assumptions used are based on experience
and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Estimates are used to measure any provisions for doubtful receivables, inventory obsolescence, depreciation and
amortization, write-downs, employee benefits, restructuring funds, taxes, other provisions, funds, and valuations of
derivative instruments.

Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of any changes are recognized in the income
statement in the period in which the estimate is revised (if the revision affects only that period) or in the period of the
revision and future periods (if the revision affects both current and future periods).

## Valuation methods

The valuation methods and the main assumptions used by management in applying accounting standards which relate
to the future development of operations are described below. These methods and assumptions may have significant
effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, meaning that adjustments may need to be
made in future years, with similarly significant effects on these amounts.

###### TAXES

The overall determination of tax expense may require the use of estimates and valuations, including those relating to
any specific tax liabilities which may not be determinable at the time the individual transactions are carried out.
Additionally, in order to calculate deferred tax assets, the RDM Group employs estimates and valuations which also
take into account expectations of future events.

###### IMPAIRMENT TESTS

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to assess whether
there are any impairment indicators. If any such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated
through an impairment test to determine the write-down amount.

The RDM Group has used the procedure described in IAS 36 to identify the cash-generating units representing the
smallest identifiable groups of assets which generate cash flows that are largely independent within the consolidated
financial statements.

The lowest segregation of assets for cashgenerating units (CGU) is represented by the individual mills.

The recoverability of carrying amounts at this level of aggregation is tested by comparing the net carrying amount of
the Net Invested Capital of the individual Cash Generating Units with the value in use represented by the current value
of the estimated future cash flows from the continuing use of the assets making up the Cash Generating Units and that
of their terminal value.

The impairment test relating to the cash generating units (CGU) is carried out from the asset side perspective, estimating
the operating value or the enterprise value of the CGUs. Note that the scope of the CGUs coincides with an entire legal
entity, as in the case of the foreign companies R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH, RDM Blendecques S.A.S., RDM Barcelona
Cartonboard S.A.U., Fineska B.V., Papelera del Principado S.A., Ondupacart S.A. and Italian companies R.D.M. Ovaro
S.p.A. and PAC Service S.p.A., or with the production plants of Santa Giustina (BL) and Villa Santa Lucia (FR), belonging
to the Parent company Reno de Medici S.p.A.

Note that, as of December 31, 2021, the RDM Group identified as impairment indicators: a negative contribution to the
Group EBITDA and a net equity below the book value. Accordingly, impairment tests were carried out for the companies
RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U., RDM Blendecques S.A.S. and R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH.

No need for write-downs emerged from the aforementioned impairment tests.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

Additionally, an impairment test is conducted annually on the PAC Service S.p.A. CGU as a result of the goodwill of €4.4
million allocated to it at the time of acquisition. Based on the impairment test conducted, no need for any write-down
was identified.

The main assumptions used by the Group in measuring the recoverable amount (value in use) are:

a) estimates of future operating cash flows;
b) the discount rate;
c) the final growth rate.

In making these forecasts, the RDM Group used assumptions based on the following key variables: estimate of future
sales volumes, trend in sales prices, variable costs of energy and packaging, profit margins, and macroeconomic
variables.

The Group has used a net rate of 5.83% when discounting cash flows, which reflects current market assessments and
also takes into account the specific risks of the sector.

During the development of the impairment test, the terminal value was determined by using a growth rate (g rate) of
1.5%.

The result of the impairment test is derived from the information available to date and from estimates of the evolution
of various variables. For this reason, the Group carried out sensitivity analyses on the results of the tests, compared to
the underlying assumptions (use of the growth rate in calculating the terminal value and discount rate) that affect the
value in use of the cash generating units. There has been no need for a write-down following these sensitivity analyses.

###### SEGMENT INFORMATION

Following the sale of R.D.M. Rochette S.A.S., the RDM Group is no longer present in the FBB segment, cardboard for
folding cartons based on virgin fibers, and consequently the reporting used internally by the administrators highlights
the results in the only operating sector recycled Board, cardboard coated for packaging based on recycled fibers,
Represented by the plants in France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and all the plants operating in Italy.

The Group assesses the performance of its operating segment on the basis of gross operating profit, operating income
and profit/(loss) for the year.

As part of the way in which the Group is managed, financial income and expense are continually monitored and
measured by the treasury function of the parent company Reno De Medici S.p.A., where, from an operating standpoint,
all decisions of a financial nature are also made.

Economic information by geographic segment as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is as follows:

## Notes

Following the sale on April 30, 2021, of 100% of the stake held in R.D.M. Rochette S.A.S., all the income statement data
as of December 31, 2020 were reclassified in the “Discontinued Operations” line to make them comparable with those
as of December 31, 2021.

# 1. REVENUES FROM SALES

These revenues arise essentially from the sale of cartonboard:

(thousands of euros) **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020** **Variation**

Revenues from sales 803,214 563,573 239,641

**Total** **803,214** **563,573** **239,641**

The following table provides a geographical breakdown of sales revenues:

(thousands of euros) **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020** **Variation** **%**

Italy 225,305 179,319 45,986 26%

European Union 440,396 303,815 136,581 45%

Rest of the world 137,513 80,439 57,074 71%

**Total revenues from sales** **803,214** **563,573** **239,641** **43%**

The trend in revenues from the sale of packaging board is a function of the general economic trend of the outlet markets
and, in particular, of the trend in final demand for consumer goods. It is not affected by specific interim seasonality
dynamics.

There are, however, seasonal effects in the production and sale of products as a result of variations in the calendar,
such as if there is a high number of public holidays and/or periods of vacation in a particular month or accounting period
that may typically recur in the main countries supplied (e.g. August and December).

Sales Revenues amounted to 803.2 million euro, compared to 563.6 million euro in the previous year. The increase of
239.6 million euro is attributable for 145.5 million euro to the change in the scope of consolidation and for the remaining
94.1 million euro to the increase in volumes sold and the first effects of the sales price increases applied during 2021.

# 2. OTHER REVENUES

Other revenues can be broken down into the following categories:

(thousands of euros) **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020** **Variation**

Grants 3,354 1,112 2,242

Indemnities 162 171 (9)


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

Energy revenues 10,618 6,967 3,651

Other revenues 3,509 1,979 1,530

**Total** **17,643** **10,229** **7,414**

The item “contributions”, amounting to 3.4 million euro, essentially includes the contributions in favor of the German
subsidiary R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH, Spanish subsidiaries RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. and Papelera del Principado
S.A., and Fineska Group B.V. in accordance with the respective local regulations that support the competitiveness of
energy-intensive industrial sites.

“Energy revenues” relate to amounts received from certain energy suppliers for joining the “interruption” scheme, and
to income from the sale of electricity in 2021. The increase of 3.7 million euro is primarily due to the change in the scope
of consolidation.

The “Other revenues” mainly include contingent assets, capital gains deriving from the sale of assets and other minor
revenues.

# 3. CHANGE IN INVENTORIES OF FINISHED GOODS

The change in inventories is negative by 1.7 million euro compared to 6.9 million as of December 31, 2020. This change
is primarily attributable to the change in the scope of consolidation.

# 4. COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND SERVICES

(thousands of euros) **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020** **Variation**

**Cost of raw materials** **364,690** **221,420** **143,270**

Postal and telecommunication 1,089 1,024 65

Other costs 17,573 9,944 7,629

**Cost for use of third-party assets** **2,178** **1,016** **1,162**

Rental and leasing 2,178 1,016 1,162

**Total** **663,168** **398,849** **264,319**

The “Cost of raw materials” refers mainly to the purchase of products used to make pulp (waste paper, wood paste,
cellulose and chemicals) and for packaging.

This item shows an increase of 143 million euro, with 62.7 million euro due to a change in the scope of consolidation
and the remaining 80.3 million euro due to the increase in the price of waste paper. The latter is due to strong demand,
mainly from the corrugated board sector as a result of the expansion of e-commerce, and to the collection, in particular
that of the city, still below the pre-pandemic levels.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

Service costs rose by 119.9 million euro, with 60.9 million euro due to the change in the scope of consolidation and 59
million euro due to the increase in purchase prices of the Group’s main energy sources, namely natural gas, electricity
and coal. This price increase, which began in December 2020, accelerated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2021, affecting
the Group’s profitability despite the fact that the main source of supply, gas, has been partially hedged by the Group.

“Lease and rental costs” as at December 31, 2021 amounted to 2.2 million euro. The increase compared to December
31, 2020, in the amount of 1 million euro, is substantially due to the change in the consolidation scope. These costs
relate to contracts that fall outside the scope of the IFRS 16 accounting standard because they fall within the low value
and/or short term exceptions, as defined on first application of the principle itself.

# 5. PERSONNEL COST

(thousands of euros) **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020** **Variation**

Wages and salaries 81,817 64,758 17,059

Social security contributions 22,835 19,300 3,535

Allowance for defined-contribution plans 4,916 2,771 2,145

Allowance for defined-benefit plans 773 703 70

Other costs 6,683 2,675 4,008

**Total** **117,024** **90,207** **26,817**

Personnel costs amounted to 117 million euro, up 26.8 million euro compared with 90.2 million euro as of December
31, 2020. This change is attributable for 24.6 million euro to the change in the scope of consolidation. The difference,
amounting to 2 million euro, is substantially due to changes in and reinforcement of staff, salary adjustments for
performance increases and incentive plans for top management.

The following tables provide a breakdown by category of the number of RDM Group employees at the end of the year
and the average number of employees during the year:

**Employees by category** **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020 [(*)]** **Variation**

# 7. AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION

The following table sets out details of the item “Depreciation and amortization”:

(thousands of euros) **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020** **Variation**

Amortization of intangible assets 2,461 1,702 759

Depreciation of tangible fixed assets 28,706 25,400 3,306

Depreciation and amortization of Right-of-use asset 3,748 2,903 845

**Total** **34,915** **30,005** **4,910**

Amortization as at December 31, 2021 amounted to 34.9 million euro. The increase of 4.9 million euro is substantially
due to the change in the scope of consolidation.

into by the Spanish subsidiary to hedge gas purchases and energy sales, as a result of which financial expense of 2.1
million euro was recognized in the financial statements; as of December 31, 2020, this valuation had resulted in the
recognition of financial income of 2.2 million euro.

The item “Financial expense on defined-benefit plans” refers to the financial component of the provision for the year
solely with respect to interest costs.

# 10. INCOME (LOSSES) FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Current taxes 197 (12,494) 12,691

**Total** **(11)** **(11,448)** **11,437**

Prepaid taxes as of December 31, 2021, of 208 thousand euro, essentially include recognition of the deferred tax assets
of the Parent Company Reno De Medici S.p.A. (0.1 million euro) and to the Spanish subsidiary Papelera del Principado
S.A. (0.5 million euro) net of deferred taxes recognized by the subsidiary R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH (EUR 0.2 million).

Current taxes as of December 31, 2021 amounted to 197 thousand euro, down by 12.7 million euro compared to 2020
due to the lower tax base of the companies in the group.

More information on “Deferred taxes” can be found in Note 25.

###### Reconciliation between the theoretical tax burden and the tax burden as per the financial statements (income taxes)

_(*) The data account for the effect of recognizing CO2 emission rights._

Intangible fixed assets with a definite useful life stood at 45.8 million euro, an increase of 25.8 million euro compared
with the previous year. This change is essentially due to the change in the consolidation scope, in the amount of 2.9
million euro, and to the recognition of CO2 emission rights, in the amount of 28.5 million euro. In particular, the item
“CO2 emission rights” combines the 2021 emission rights in the amount of 14.6 million euro, which will be adjusted in
April 2022, with emission rights in the amount of 13.9 million euro already purchased during the year under review to
cover emissions in 2022.

The aforementioned increases are partially offset by depreciation for the year in the amount of 2.5 million euro.

“Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life” refer to the valuation of concessions granted in Germany in relation to
water rights with an indefinite useful life. At the date of the financial statements, the Group conducted the impairment
test, in accordance with the IAS 36, and it was not necessary to record any impairment. More information can be found
in the section “Impairment Tests”.

The item “Tax credits” primarily includes income tax credits of 7.6 million euro and VAT credits of 5.8 million euro.

The change compared with the previous year, amounting to 8.8 million euro, is essentially due to:

December 31, 2021;

  - an increase of 3 million euro in the VAT credit following the inclusion of the ESKA Group in the scope of
consolidation;

S.A.S. and RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U.;

  - The current share, equal to 2.2 million euro, of the above mentioned vendor loan;

The table below provides a breakdown of inventories at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

(thousands of euros) **12.31.2021** **12.31.2020** **Variation**

in the scope of consolidation and for 5.4 million Euro to the increase in purchase prices.

The change in the provision for obsolescence of raw, ancillary and consumable materials, amounting to 4.2 million euro,
is essentially due to the sale of the French subsidiary R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S.

The increase in inventories of finished goods, amounting to 6.9 million euro, is due to the change in the scope of
consolidation, amounting to 13.4 million euro, partially offset by a reduction in inventories on a likefor-like basis due to
the increase in demand.

An explanation of the change in inventories of finished goods can be found in Note 3.

Consolidated net debt as of December 31, 2021 amounted to 186.4 million euro with an increase of 177.5 million euro
compared to December 2021 (8.9 million euro). The increase is essentially due to the acquisition of Eska and Paprinsa,
for 147 and 8.7 million euro respectively, with the debt of these Companies, as of December 31, amounting to 9.5
million euro for Eska and 20.4 million euro for Paprinsa, and the payment of ancillary costs relating to the acquisitions
amounting to 2.6 million euro. Net of these extraordinary effects, the financial position would improve on the year-toyear period by a total of 10.7 million euro. Also worth mentioning is the positive effect of the proceeds from the sale of
the land located in Boffalora Sopra Ticino, amounting to 8 million euro, and the effect of the sale of the equity
investment in La Rochette in April, amounting to 5 million euro. Dividends of 5.3 million euro were paid during 2021.

**Net financial debt** **8,872** **176,018** **1,462** **186,352**

It should be noted that, following the change in the shareholder of the RDM Group, a restructuring of the financial debt
was initiated, following which the residual portions relating to most of the medium/long-term loans outstanding as of
December 31, 2021 were repaid in advance. In particular, on January 13, 2022 the RDM Group received a loan from the
new parent company Rimini Bidco S.p.A. worth 166.8 million euro with which the above loans and some short-term
loans were repaid.

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

The non-current portions of the loans repaid on January 13, 2022 were reclassified under current financial payables
either because the related contracts provided for a “change of control” clause or as a result of a very advanced
negotiation with the banks regarding the early repayment of the residual shares.

-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

calculated as an increase in the privileged dividend in the next two financial years. Dividends totaling 6,000 euro were
distributed in 2021 to holders of savings shares.

In addition, dividends totaling 5.3 million euro were distributed to holders of ordinary shares.

Note that on November 2, 2015, the Shareholders’ Meeting of Reno De Medici S.p.A. had approved, inter alia, subject
to the amendment of the By-Laws, the creation of an “Available reserve” through voluntary reduction of capital
pursuant to Article 2445 of the Italian Civil Code in the amount of 10,399,255.80 euro. The purpose of this operation,
which took effect on February 29, 2016, included the purchase and sale of treasury shares as a tool for stabilizing the
share price.

On the same occasion, a program for the purchase and disposal of own shares was authorized, whose number may not
exceed one fifth of the share capital.

As part of this Program, during 2020, in compliance with the authorization resolved, pursuant to art. 2357 of the Italian
Civil Code, by the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting of April 29, 2020, a new plan for the purchase of treasury shares was
started. Treasury shares held as of December 31, 2021 amounted to 2,070,000, valued at 1,539,000 euro. For further
information please refer to the paragraph “Other information - Authorization to buy and sell treasury shares”.

In April 2020, the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting approved an Incentive Plan dedicated to the Chief Executive Officer
and Executives with strategic responsibilities concerning the free assignment of a maximum number of 2,070,000 Stock
Grants giving each beneficiary the right to receive shares, at the end of the performance period, and subject to the
achievement of certain performance targets to be identified for each year of the three-year period as well as the
circumstance that the beneficiaries maintain their respective positions/work relationships in the Company. Following
the approval of this Plan, a Stock Grant reserve of 1,622,000 euro was recorded at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, deferred tax liabilities were offset by deferred tax assets where conditions specified in IAS 12
were met, notably where the two items relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and where there is a
legally enforceable right to offset in this manner.

Deferred tax assets are recognized where it is probable that the Company will have taxable income in the future,
including the deferral of taxable temporary differences to future years, which will allow the utilization of deductible
temporary differences or tax losses carried forward.

The table below shows a breakdown of the Group’s tax losses totaling EUR 93.3 million:

disputes (0.1 million euro).

management (1.3 million euro) and to certain legal cases (0.4 million euro).

_(*) The data account for the effect of recognizing CO2 emission rights._

Having examined the financial models and criteria used to estimate the fair values of the above-mentioned financial
instruments, further details are provided below on the individual items.

###### Derivative instruments

In general, the fair value of derivatives is calculated according to mathematical models using directly observable input
data (such as an interest rate curve).

The Group’s only derivative instruments indexed to interest rates are interest rate swaps. A discounted cash flow model
is used to measure these instruments, whereby the fair value of a derivative is given by the algebraic sum of the present
values of future cash flows estimated on the basis of the risk-free curve of deposit rates, futures and swaps at the
reporting date.

In addition, a number of commodity swap contracts are in place. In particular, the subsidiary RDM Barcelona
Cartonboard S.A.U. signed commodity swap contracts to hedge purchases of gas and sales of energy. In spite of these
agreements having been concluded for hedging purposes, they were not recorded under hedge accounting.

The reference international accounting standard (IFRS 13) identifies a measurement hierarchy based on three levels:

  - level 1: inputs used in measurements are represented by quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
and liabilities to those subject to measurement;

  - level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability,
both directly (prices) and indirectly (derived from prices);

  - level 3: in the event that observable inputs are not available, and therefore market activity is light or
nonexistent for the asset or liability subject to measurement, the inputs are non-observable.

It should be noted that, following the debt restructuring and early repayment of loans, as described in greater detail in
the “Loans” section, the payable arising from the valuation of interest rate swaps has been classified among current
financial payables.

As at December 31, 2021, the Group did not hold any foreign-exchange derivative instruments.

which the residual portions relating to most of the medium/long-term loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were
repaid in advance. In particular, on January 13, 2022 the RDM Group received a loan from the new parent company
Rimini Bidco S.p.A. worth 166.8 million euro with which the above-mentioned loans and some short-term loans were
repaid.

The non-current portions of the loans repaid on January 13, 2022 were reclassified under current financial payables
either because the related contracts provided for a “change of control” clause or as a result of a very advanced
negotiation with the banks regarding the early repayment of the residual shares.

###### Other Financial Instruments

The fair value of receivables from customers, payables to suppliers and other financial assets and liabilities falling due
contractually during the year has not been calculated, insofar as the book value of the financial instrument is virtually
the same.

**Total** **3,202** **1,463** **4,805** **56,761** **66,231**

The Group’s overdue receivables at December 31, 2021 in absolute terms increased compared with the previous year
(+5.9 million euro). This increase is attributable to the change in the scope of consolidation. They represent 11.5% of
the total portfolio in 2021, compared with 14.3% reported in the previous year.

###### How Credit Risk is Managed

As a general rule, the Group’s commercial risk management policy is to insure all client receivables, excluding those of
the Parent company’s Italian customers, with leading insurance companies. Any uninsured or noninsurable positions,
in particular those with Italian customers, are constantly monitored by the appropriate Corporate Functions.

In addition, contracts were signed for the non-recourse assignment of receivables by the Parent Company and the
French and Spanish subsidiaries.

The internal procedures for carrying out a creditworthiness assessment involve collecting and analyzing qualitative and
quantitative information, and the use of external databases and commercial information. The policies adopted have so
far enabled losses on receivables to be limited.

###### MARKET RISK

Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value or the cash flows associated with a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market variables such as exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices, and stock prices.

The market risk to which the Group was exposed during the year may be broken down as follows:

  - currency risk;

  - interest rate risk;

  - commodity risk.

The scale of these risks and the way in which they are managed is described below.

###### Currency risk

The Group’s exposure to currency risk derives from:

  - trade receivables/payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the financial
statements;

  - cash and cash equivalents held in foreign-currency current accounts;

Other than the Euro, which is the functional currency, the main currencies in which the Group carries out its commercial
activities are the United States dollar and the British pound. Exposure to other currencies is negligible.

In terms of exposure to currency risk, in 2021 the Group managed the marginal imbalance between investments and
funds in the same currency by using a natural-hedging approach and by carefully and continually monitoring market
conditions; as a result, it was not deemed necessary to resort to hedging derivatives.

The Group’s exposure in euro, based on the official ECB exchange rates as of December 31, 2021 and December 31,
2020, is shown in the following table.

###### Sensitivity Analysis of Currency Risk

In order to measure the possible effects of changes in the reporting-date exchange rates on the statement of financial
position and income statement, assumptions were made (at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020) as to
variations in the value of the euro against the major foreign currencies.

Specifically, two scenarios were used: a 10% appreciation and a 10% depreciation of the Euro against the other
currencies. For each of the two scenarios, the gain or loss arising from transactions outstanding as at December 31,
2021 and December 31, 2020 was then calculated. In this way, it was possible to determine the effect on the income
statement and on shareholders’ equity had the market exchange rates been subject to the assumed changes.

###### How Currency Risk is Managed

The main objective of the Group’s currency-risk management policy is to limit the exposure to foreign currency arising
from exporting finished goods to, and importing raw materials from, foreign markets. The following guidelines are used
in pursuing this policy:

  - inflows and outflows in the same currency are offset (natural hedging);

  - forward sales are hedged. There were no outstanding transactions of this type at the reporting date.

As a general rule, the currency-risk management policy recommends maximizing the use of natural hedging and, in any
case, excludes recourse to transactions involving complex derivatives, e.g. those with barriers.

The Administration and Finance Department of the Group is responsible for monitoring currency risk and recommends
suitable currency-risk hedging strategies to keep exposure within the limits agreed with senior management.

###### Interest rate risk and how to manage interest rate risk

As a result of the “Financing” paragraph, the structure of the Group’s financial debt is no longer based mainly on
variable-rate regulated mediumlong-term financing, but is based on fixed-rate financing provided by the parent
company Rimini Bidco S.p.A. Therefore, to date, the interest rate risk should be considered low.

###### Sensitivity Analysis of Interest Rate Risk

As a result of the above, no sensitivity analysis was carried out on interest rate risk.

###### Commodity risk

In terms of the nature of the business carried out by RDM Group, commodity risk is the risk that the profit for the year
will be reduced by incurring higher costs to purchase raw materials for the mills. This risk is part of the broader category
of market risk, specifically where the cost of the raw material is dependent on changes in a quoted index.

During the three-year period from 2018 to 2020, the Group also signed contracts for the supply of natural gas to be
delivered in 2021, operating mainly on quarterly, annual and three-year basis. Unit prices were fixed for each of the


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

subsequent supply periods. This method made it possible to significantly reduce price volatility (“commodity risk”), also
allowing the Group to benefit from a generalized fall in the prices of energy products during the half-year as a result of
the fall in demand. Supplies pertaining to the last three quarters of 2021 were negotiated and confirmed during the
year in order to meet the mills’ requirements. However, as of Q2 2021, the price trend had already reversed, initially
showing moderate and then decisive increases in prices, which continued until the end of the year. As a result, as at the
expiration of the current contracts, the conditions for renewal have deteriorated significantly, with decisive cost
increases in the fourth and final quarter of 2021. The gas quotas taken under multiannual contracts expiring on
12/31/2021 mitigated this increase in cost.

All prices of natural gas, the Group’s main energy commodity, are expressed in euro per volume unit, with subsequent
adjustments to the content of primary energy contained in it.

In order to supplement the electricity demand in excess of the quantities produced internally by its own cogeneration
plants, the Group has signed electricity supply contracts for 2021 at a price generally indexed according to prices of
some continental energy markets. In some cases, fixing operations were carried out following the conclusion of
contracts. The supply quotas at an indexed price are negotiated with fixed spreads compared to the spot prices on
reference markets.

The options for fixing prices of supply quotas were aimed at containing the “commodity risk” in some particularly
volatile regional markets such as the Spanish and French markets. The negotiated prices are expressed in euro per unit
of electricity. In 2020, new electricity supply (or of supply for export) agreements for Europe were negotiated for 2021,
in conjunction with the subsidiaries operating in France and Spain. The group production entities use the same supplier,
except for the subsidiaries operating in Germany and the Netherlands. Given the low volumes of energy purchased in
regions with the lowest risk of volatility, contracts were only partially negotiated at a fixed price and this generated cost
increases in Q4 2021, as a result of the sudden across-the-board price increase in Europe. The group benefited from
these increases because it placed surplus production on the market, which for some production companies is of a
significant size.

###### How Commodity Risk is Managed

The nature of the Group’s business involves exposure to fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas and certain
chemical products derived from petroleum (such as latexes) and fibrous raw materials.

Natural gas supply contracts are usually agreed for total requirements at a fixed price and are negotiated at least three
months before the supply period, but sometimes for longer periods in relation to the supply period. Electricity is
purchased partly at a fixed price, and partly at prices indexed according to the values of continental electricity markets,
as published by the bodies responsible for these markets.

In order to contain possible price pressure on raw materials, the Group aims to diversify its suppliers and its supply
markets.

Note that at December 31, 2021, the RDM Group had commodity swap agreements. In particular, in 2021 the subsidiary
RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. signed commodity swap contracts to hedge gas purchases and energy sales.

There are no other commodity swap agreements.

###### Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk can take the form of difficulty in obtaining the funds required to satisfy scheduled contractual
commitments at market conditions. This may mean there are insufficient resources available to meet financial
obligations under the agreed terms and conditions and at the predetermined due dates, or it may mean the business is
required to settle its financial liabilities earlier than the scheduled due date. For each contract maturity date, the
analysis aimed to measure the cash flows deriving from the various types of financial liability held as at December 31,
2021 and December 31, 2020. Depending on their nature, financial liabilities were separated into non-derivative and
derivative financial liabilities. Given the different accounting treatments, the latter were subdivided into liabilities
where the derivative had been formally designated as a hedge, and had turned out to be effective, or liabilities where
the derivative was not subject to hedge accounting.


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

The main assumptions relating to the Group’s financial requirements that were used to carry out the analyses were as
follows:

  - cash flows are not discounted;

  - cash flows are allocated to their respective time bands on the basis of the first possible payment date provided
for by the contractual terms and conditions (the worst-case scenario);

  - all instruments held at the reporting date for which payments have been contractually designated are included;
planned future commitments that have not yet been recognized in the financial statements are not included;

  - if the amount payable is not fixed (e.g. future interest payments), financial liabilities are measured at market
terms and conditions at the reporting date;

  - cash flows also include the interest that the Group will pay up to the due date of the debt, measured at the
reporting date and calculated on the basis of market forward interest rates.

###### How Liquidity Risk is Managed


-----

**As of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (continued)**

The Group’s financial activity is centered largely on Reno De Medici S.p.A., which, on the basis of wellestablished
practice inspired by prudence and stakeholder protection, negotiates credit facilities with banks and continually
monitors the cash flows of the individual Group companies.

The Group’s management policies involve continually monitoring liquidity risk with a view to mitigating said risk by
maintaining sufficient liquidity and/or short-term deposits with prime counterparties and by having access to shortterm credit facilities backed mainly by receivables from domestic and foreign clients.
