In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes by paying a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. Pending MTO Completion the gross proceeds from the Offering will be deposited into the Escrow Account.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from any contingent consideration arrangements. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquirer’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Following the Share Acquisitions, final valuations will be completed and the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be finalized during the one year measurement period prescribed by IFRS 3.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading European producer and distributor of recycled cartonboard, active in the coated and uncoated recycled cartonboard industry. We operate in the white lined chipboard (“WLC”) and solidboard (“SB”) market segments, in each case with a demonstrated track record of making our operations more sustainable as both WLC and SB are manufactured from recovered paper. Our cartonboard can be used as both primary and secondary packaging, and applications of our packaging include, without limitation, food packaging, shoe boxes, trays, toys, furniture, displays, bookbindings, boxes and puzzles. Our identity is built on a clear vision centered on the circular economy that guides our activities as a manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, and that represents a balanced combination between our business and the expectations of our stakeholders; see also “Business — Our Production Process — Circular Business Model.” Our ambition is to be the partner of choice of all key stakeholders with three strategic goals in mind: to offer excellent products and services, to optimize costs and to maximize the satisfaction of our customers, all while helping drive increased sustainability within the paper and packaging industry. We serve our customers through a network of nine mills, five sheeting and distribution centres, and ten sales offices. As of December 31, 2020, we employed over 1,990 employees (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We believe that our geographical footprint across Europe and exposure to resilient end-markets (such as the food end-market) are key strengths of our business, which we have reinforced through the recent Eska Acquisition and Paprinsa Acquisition. Our position as a leader in the European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills, our “multi-mill” concept, whereby we seek to be able to offer the same cartonboard products at different mills, helping us provide highly localized delivery quickly and better meet our customers’ demands. Our distributed mill network is integrated by our “One Company” operating model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent. - WLC. In our WLC market segment, we produce cartonboard from recycled fibers for folding carton and corrugated packaging applications. We are the second largest WLC producer (based on annual production capacity as of December 31, 2020), with a market share of approximately 25% for 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition), in a highly fragmented European market. We are also the largest WLC producer based on our annual production capacity as of December 31, 2020, in Italy, France and Spain. In terms of production capacity, WLC represents approximately 76% of our business as of December 31, 2020 (giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We had a total WLC production capacity of 1,166 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition). - SB. In our SB market segment, we produce solidboard from recycled fibers for packaging and graphical applications. We had a total production capacity of 359 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition). In terms of production capacity, SB represents approximately 24% of our business as of December 31, 2020 (giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We are a leading solidboard producer with a global reach. Following the Eska Acquisition, we now have two industryleading solidboard production facilities (in terms of production capacity) in The Netherlands with the ----- largest SB production capacity among participants in the core market segments in which Eska operates (which include luxury packaging, bookbinding, puzzles and games) for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal as if they had occurred on October 1, 2020), we generated adjusted pro forma consolidated revenues from sales of €853.9 million, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of €119.2 million and an Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA Margin of 14.0%, and we had Adjusted Pro Forma tons sold of 1,451 tons.

The majority of our sales derive from resilient and essential end-markets, such as the food end-market. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal), more than 60% of the end-users of our WLC products operated within the resilient food market. Our solidboard products are purchased for use in applications such as producing packaging for the growing luxury packaging market, as well as bookbinding, stationary, and manufacturing puzzles and games. ----- We are committed to sustainability and believe that are well-placed to benefit from the ongoing shift away from plastic packaging and toward more sustainable alternatives. We believe that we have an attractive sustainability profile, and our commitment to sustainability has been historically supported by a track record of demonstrable achievements. For the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the La Rochette Disposal), 94% of the fibrous material we used was recycled and over 83% of all materials used consisted of renewable materials. In addition, we have reduced each of our carbon emissions and water discharges per ton of cartonboard produced by approximately 13% since 2017. As our business continues to evolve, we remain committed to strengthening our product portfolio and offerings by focusing on renewable, recyclable and actually-recycled solutions (solutions with high recycling rates). In line with the latest market trends, we are directing our development activities toward cartonboard and solidboard products that can replace plastic packaging. We are focusing our efforts toward the development of renewable and recyclable “barrier solutions” that are fully integrated with the fiber-based material structure of the cartonboard. Our consistent aim is to promote and preserve the integrity of the packaged product while ensuring recyclability of the coated and uncoated cartonboard after its use.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Portion of Sales in Tons by Geography[(1)] Portion of Sales in Tons by End-use[(2)] Capacity by Product[(3)],9.2.2,Our history,"Since our founding in Italy in 1967, we have grown to be an industry leader and key participant in the recycled cartonboard industry. Our business has grown organically and successfully executed a number of acquisitions. In 1967, Cartiere del Reno was founded, with a plant in Bologna, Italy. A period of steady growth followed. In 1985, the Ovaro Plant was acquired and in 1986 we acquired Cartiera Binda de Medici, prompting us to change our company name to Reno De Medici S.p.A. (“RdM”). Cascades, a paper and packaging company founded in Canada in 1964 and today an industry giant, acquired its first paper mill in Europe in 1985, La Rochette, thereby expanding their range of activity. In 2008, Cascades Inc. acquired a majority stake in our company and we combined with the Cascades Europe operations, including the Arnsberg (Germany), Blendecques (France), and La Rochette (France) cartonboard mills. To rationalize resources, RdM and Cascades Europe joined forces: the company dedicated to recycled production took the name RdM, and the company dedicated to sales was called Careo. This was followed by a period of restructuring and integration. In 2016, RdM acquired Cascades La Rochette. This allowed it to enter the cartonboard industry made from virgin fiber. The company continued to grow and integrate operations, and on January 1, 2017, RdM, Cascades La Rochette and Careo Group were formally united into a single group with a single identity: the RdM Group. In 2018, we began implementing our latest series of strategic initiatives, which focused on transforming our business through enhancing integration and efficiency across our network of mills, strategically improving our cost structure and integrating the businesses that we acquired through bolt-on acquisitions. Since 2018, we have made multiple acquisitions, including completing the Barcelona Cartonboard Acquisition to strengthen our recycled cartonboard presence in Spain and Southern Europe (which includes Spain, Italy and France) and increase proximity to key European packaging converters, our customers. Through the Paprinsa Acquisition, which was completed in July 2021, we expect to further consolidate our leading WLC position in Southern Europe and support our “multi-mill” concept. Most recently, we completed the Eska Acquisition in July 2021. Eska is a leading producer of high-quality solidboard with a global presence and customer base. We believe that the Eska Acquisition strengthens our position in Europe, significantly increasing our solidboard production capacity, and expanding our presence in the United States and Asia. In addition, the Eska Acquisition provides us with attractive opportunities in the high-margin luxury packaging sector, which we expect to grow over the coming years. Another key component of this transformation has been our exit from the folding box board (“FBB”) market segment through the La Rochette Disposal. By exiting the FBB market segment, we have refocused the business on developing our recycled cartonboard products within our multimill concept. These acquisitions and divestitures have been key components of our strategic transformation into a leading and pure-play circular economy recycled cartonboard provider. On October 26, 2021, the Issuer consummated the Private Acquisition and thereby acquired 67% of the shares in RdM from Cascades and Caisse de dépot et placement du Québec.

While our network of nine paper mills is strategically located to best serve our panEuropean customer base, which requires localized service, our operations remain integrated. We centrally manage operations, and we are currently enhancing our ability to integrate operations across our network by implementing the same enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems in all of our mills. Additionally, improvements to our information technology (“IT”) resources have allowed, and we believe we will continue to allow, us to balance the availability of products across our network of mills, to optimize proximity to customers, to protect their security of supply and to mitigate the risks posed by market volatility arising from changes in the supply and demand dynamics in local markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Key Strengths,9.3.1,We have a leading market position in the resilient and growing WLC industry and are well-positioned to benefit from further growth and stability.,"With a total WLC production capacity of 1,166 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition), we would have had the largest production capacity of WLC manufacturers in Italy, France and Spain and the second largest production capacity of WLC manufacturers in Europe in 2020. Our position as a leader in the European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills integrated by our “One Company”operating model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent. As a leading WLC manufacturer, we are poised to benefit from the growth and evolution of the WLC market. Industry sources indicate that the WLC market segment is resilient and diversified. Moreover, the demand for WLC in many of our key end-user markets (such as the food end-market) in Europe has grown at a rate exceeding that of the industry-wide average, according to analysis from an industry leading consulting firm. The chart below presents (based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm) demand for WLC for 2015 and 2020 for each of Europe and Southern Europe (which includes Spain, Italy and France). #### Evolution of Historical WLC Demand in Europe _Million tons of demand_ 3.7 3.6 1.1 1.0 ## // // 2015 2020 2015 2020 ###### Europe Southern Europe Just as the demand for WLC ultimately depends on the demand from the end-markets, the resilience of the WLC industry is also supported by the diversity and by the resilience of the industry’s end-markets. The chart below is based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm and highlights how the WLC demand is driven by the stable and resilient food end-market. Food end-market demand is defined by different sub-segments, such as frozen and chilled food (19% of total demand), driven by demographic changes and convenience trends, dry food (16% of total demand) and other food sub-segments (12% of total demand). Overall the broad food end-market represents approximately 50% of the total demand for WLC. ----- ### WLC Demand By End-use Markets Other Non-Food 20% Frozen & Chilled Food 19% Cosmetics & Beauty 5% Pharma 6% Liners 14% Confectionery 4% Dry Food 16% Other Food 12% Beverages 4% We believe a number of market trends will continue to support WLC market development in Europe over the next several years — with Southern Europe expected to experience even stronger demand growth as a consequence of WLC’s stronger position in the region — and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends. In particular, we believe that the growing preference for sustainable products, along with increasing regulatory actions against the use of plastics and plastic packaging, will likely cause a growing number of manufacturers to switch from plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, such as WLC packaging made from recycled fibers by producers like us. Additionally, we expect growth in e-commerce to drive demand for WLC liners used in packaging production. Also, we expect demand for frozen and convenience foods to increase due to demographic shifts and changes in consumer preferences favoring convenience, and these segments of the food end-market are especially heavy users of WLC packaging. The chart below shows (based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm) the development of WLC end-usage between 2015 and 2019 with 91% of the above mentioned WLC demand from growing endmarkets, mainly the food end-market. Essential and highly resilient end segments such as broad food and pharmaceuticals have experienced the highest historical demand growth. ###### Historical WLC Development by End-Markets 2015-19 _LHS: 1,000 Tons %: Increment per annum 2015-19_ 50 - (50) ----- In addition, the charts below illustrate (based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm) the estimated growth in WLC usage in Southern Europe for the periods indicated, as well as the estimated growth (2019 – 2030) for the various WLC end segments. These changes are driven by, among others, a preference for fiber-based materials and sustainable products, increased popularity of frozen and chilled foods driven by geographic changes and convenience trends, and increased focus on replacement of plastic packaging by sustainable options in light of brand owners’ and retailers’ sustainability targets in response to increasing consumer sentiment favoring sustainability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The graph below illustrates the estimated growth, according to management estimates, of the global solidboard market for the periods indicated in thousands of tons. ----- ##### Global Solidboard Market Outlook _(Including packaging solidboard, Kton)_ **4,000 3,800 3,300** 1,900 1,800 1,700 2,000 2,100 1,600 2015 2019 2023 Solidboard Packaging Solidboard Industry sources expect that the global solidboard market to reach around 4 million tons by 2023. This growth is primarily driven by: (i) strong opportunities in luxury packaging, an end-market expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% to 2023, as a result of increasing disposable incomes worldwide and increasing requests for innovative, aesthetically pleasing and high quality products; (ii) developments in bookbinding and stationery, driven by rising literacy rates in emerging markets and rising incomes in Asia; and (iii) increasing popularity in puzzles and games due to an increased desire to disconnect from the digital world and from the innovative development of puzzles and games. The graph below illustrates the solidboard market segmented by end-use for the year ended 2019 (expressed in percentages and excluding packaging solidboard). The trend towards sustainable and recyclable products further favors the use of solidboard, a material that is fully recyclable, instead of plastics, and we expect to have the opportunity to drive plastic substitution via the solidboard market as well, helping to further increase packaging sustainability while simultaneously increasing our company’s financial performance and growth. Through the Eska Acquisition we believe we are well-positioned to further expand our products and offerings in the solidboard market segment. Eska is a leading provider of high-quality solidboard, serving, and often operating as a long-term partner to, over 700 customers globally. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Eska sold 241 thousand tons and generated €149 million of revenues from sales. Moreover, the Eska ----- Acquisition has added two well-invested and specialized paper mills in The Netherlands to our portfolio.

Our multi-mill concept represents one of our core operating principles. We aim to produce our products in multiple mills whenever possible to ensure that our products are available to our customers in a flexible and punctual manner and in close proximity to their production sites. We believe that the multi-mill concept allows us to adopt efficiently to changes in market demand and the economic cycles of the individual countries in which we operate. We believe we have a well-invested asset base, in terms of capacity, technical age, speed and trim compared to our industry peers, which enhances our ability to effectively pursue our “multi-mill concept.” We currently serve our customers through a network of nine mills, five sheeting and distribution centers, and ten sales offices. Our mills are located in Italy, Spain, France, The Netherlands and Germany, giving us a pan-European and strategic asset base close to our customers. Rather than managing each single mill to produce a single product, our mills are designed, and operate, to manufacture multiple products whenever possible. As a result, we can shift production of many of our products across our network of mills, which gives us flexibility to balance the availability of products at individual plants and to integrate production planning across our mills. We also believe that our multi-mill concept reinforces the benefits that we believe we derive from our multi-country asset base. By increasing the interchangeability of our mills and the specific types of our cartonboard produced in multiple mills, we also increase our ability to meet our customers’ needs at each local plant. This allows us to reduce the time and cost required for product delivery and to be more immediately responsive to customers’ needs and changing demands, providing meaningful upside in a market characterized by localized preferences and requirements. Our focus on coordination within our multi-mill network also allows us to monitor and better respond to market volatility arising from rapid changes in local demand or changes in production at individual mills as well as from potential supply chain disruptions. As part of the integration of the Eska business following the Eska Acquisition, we intend to also apply our multi-mill concept to our growing solidboard business. In particular, we plan to extend the multi-mill concept into our specialty product line using the two newly acquired Eska mills and our Ovaro mill. We believe that the multi-mill concept and post-acquisition integration will allow us to transfer production volumes to different locations to reduce delivery times for existing customers as well as to find new and more profitable markets and volumes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a WLC customer base of over 1,400 customers (giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, Paprinsa Acquisition and La Rochette Disposal), with no single client representing more than 5% of our sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our ten largest WLC customers accounted for 26% of our total sales by volume, and our top 100 customers accounted for approximately 70% ----- of our total sales by volume (in each case calculated giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, Paprinsa Acquisition and La Rochette Disposal). Although our WLC customers serve participants in a number of end-markets, the majority of our WLC products are ultimately used in the uniquely attractive and resilient food end-market. In 2020, this end-market accounted for 62% of our total sales by volume. The chart below indicates, for the period ended December 31, 2020, the exposure of our WLC market segment to various end-use markets (after pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, Paprinsa Acquisition and La Rochette Disposal). ##### RDM WLC Exposure to Macro End-Markets Food Non-food Graphics In addition, we expect the use of WLC packaging to increase in the food end-market, as well as in the pharmaceutical end-market, as consumer preferences for sustainability and increased regulation drive the demand for more sustainable alternatives to plastic packaging. Moreover, we believe that broad trends in the grocery industry will further support food as being an attractive end-market for our business. For example, we expect the continued increases in demand for packaged goods as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing proliferation of product lines as a result of emerging brands and sub-brand fragmentation to drive additional demand for WLC packaging.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Volume Sold by End-market** **Volume Sold by Geography,9.5.3,We have historically been able to protect our margins by passing increases in input costs to customers.,"Although we are exposed to some level of volatility in the costs of our inputs, including for raw materials and energy, we have historically been able to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials to our customers. Due to our leading position and size, and we have historically been able to maintain selling prices higher than industry averages and to consistently strengthen our margins. In addition, we are generally not bound by long-term sales contracts, but operate instead through purchase orders, which gives us flexibility to respond to market conditions. See also “Business — Our Customers and Stakeholders.” Historically, we have generally demonstrated our ability to pass through increases in input cost pricing, particularly in fibers, to our clients. We have historically been able to unilaterally increase our selling prices without impacting our volume sold. We believe that our ability to successfully defend our margins arises from our strong leadership position in the market, our long-lasting relationships with customers, and low demand volatility. In addition, the cost of packaging is usually a small portion of the total cost of goods for brand owners. In 2021, following increases in the cost of raw materials and energy costs, we successfully implemented or are implementing five price increases, and our customers have accepted those increases without a negative impact on our volumes of tons sold.Generally, price increases are communicated in advance to our customers (effective from a certain date in the future) and the resulting higher prices take effect only for the orders made by clients from that specific day. This creates a time lag between when the rise in input prices occurs, which is almost immediate, and the effectiveness of the selling prices increases, which might take up to three months, depending on the level of backlog (i.e., the larger the backlog, the longer it takes for the new prices to manifest in new order prices and in our reported revenue). For this reason, in case of extraordinary situations, we have ----- a clause in order contracts that allows us to apply price increases retroactively, thus to all the orders already booked., thus to all the orders already booked.

In the first nine months of 2021, we successfully implemented four sale price increases, and implemented a fifth in November 2021. In particular, and as described above, in November we leveraged the clauses in our purchase order agreements which provide for raising prices retroactively to orders already booked in extraordinary situations. These clauses enabled us to apply the increase to all orders already booked with a delivery date subsequent to November 1, 2021. On a cumulative basis, including the last November price increase, we have increased prices by over €200 per ton in 2021. However, despite the magnitude of this cumulative increase, our high customer retention and strong market share have endured, and clients have accepted those increases as reflected by the absence of a negative impact on sales volumes, which in 2021 YTD have grown by comparison to the same period of 2020. Because the first four announced price increases were applicable only to new orders received from the date of applications (i.e., not retroactively), and given the high level of backlog, their effective impact on our financial performance has been delayed for a period of months as set by the backlog. The fifth price increase in November raised prices retroactively to address this, eliminating the lag time and more immediately positively impacting financial performance. The charts below reflect an adjustment to certain measures of our profitability (contribution margin and EBITDA) to normalize for the timing lag associated with the first four, non-retroactive price increases by applying the effect of the following month’s actual order prices. By applying the following month’s actual order prices to the price received for a given month’s sales volumes, we lessen the timing lag and the associated profitability impact and better match the price we are able to command at a given time with the timing of realized increases in input costs. ----- _Figure 1 — Source: Company Information. RDM EBITDA Normalization calculation Figure 2 — Source: Company Information. Eska EBITDA Normalization calculation_ We believe that we are well-positioned within the market to implement price increases, as evidenced by our history of passing along our price increases without significant reductions in volumes sold or a significant impact on our customer relationships. We intend to implement further price increases retroactively (i.e., on dispatches instead of orders) in the near-term, which we believe will further bolster our margins.

The initial MTO offer period is expected to last from November 22, 2021 to December 17, 2021, unless extended (any such initial offer period, the “MTO Subscription Period”). At the end of the MTO Subscription Period the Issuer will purchase the ordinary shares of RdM that have been tendered during such MTO Subscription Period on the settlement date of the MTO (the “Initial MTO Settlement Date”), which is expected to be on the third trading date following the expiration of the MTO Subscription Period. The purchase price of the MTO will be €1.45 per ordinary share (the “MTO Price”), which is the same price per share paid in respect of the Private Acquisitions. The public price per share of RdM’s ordinary shares was €1.448 as of November 12, 2021 according to Borsa Italiana. The Issuer intends to obtain the Delisting. The MTO is mandatory in nature and to the extent we acquire more than 90% of the ordinary shares in RdM, a Delisting will occur due to the lack of free float. Following expiration of the MTO Subscription Period, depending on the number of ordinary shares of RdM that the Issuer will have been able to purchase, the Issuer will do one of the following: (i) if at the Initial MTO Settlement Date the Issuer holds 90% or less of the issued share capital of RdM represented by ordinary shares, then the Issuer may either: (a) if the relevant conditions thereto are ----- met, reopen the tender offer period and/or (b) terminate the MTO and aim to achieve the Delisting through the Merger of RdM into Rimini BidCo S.p.A.

Following the Completion Date, the Issuer, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, intends to consummate the Merger on terms complying with Articles 2501-bis (et seq.) of the Italian Civil Code (the surviving entity of any such Merger being “MergerCo”), for which the Issuer has sufficient voting power at its current shareholding under Italian law, but which is subject to certain other conditions. See also “Description of the Notes — Merger.” To the extent that, and for so long as, the Merger does not occur, the Issuer will have access only to its proportionate share of any dividends or distributions from RdM for purposes of making payments under the Notes, there may be limits to the degree of control the Issuer can exercise over RdM due to the continued presence of minority shareholders. RdM’s shareholders who did not participate in the resolution approving the Merger (or any merger of RdM with an unlisted Apollo entity for the purpose of Delisting), if any, would have the right to give up their shares at a pre-defined liquidation value paid in cash, i.e., the right of withdrawal pursuant to Article 2437-quinquies of the Italian Civil Code (“Withdrawal Right”). In this case, the liquidation value of the shares subject to withdrawal would be determined pursuant to Italian law, with exclusive reference to the average of the closing prices in the six months preceding the publication of the notice of the shareholders meeting at which the resolutions approving the Merger (or any merger of RdM with an unlisted Apollo entity for the purpose of Delisting) were adopted. Other than pursuant to the Squeeze Out Procedure, the ability to tender is purely voluntary for existing shareholders of RdM and the Issuer cannot provide any assurances on the uptake of the MTO. For illustrative purposes, even in the event that the Issuer was to acquire no further ordinary shares of RdM, the Issuer would intend to proceed in the following manner: - to pursue the Delisting via the Merger of RdM into Rimini Bidco S.p.A. (or a merger of RdM with an unlisted Apollo entity), for which the Issuer has sufficient voting power at its current shareholding under Italian law, but which is subject to certain other conditions; and - in any event, the Issuer will use the proceeds of the Notes as set out in “Use of Proceeds.” The completion of the Merger (or any merger of RdM with an unlisted Apollo entity for the purpose of Delisting) is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed or may take several months to finalize given the required legal processes. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the _Collateral — We may be unable to complete the Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.” Failure to_ complete the Merger shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture. See also “Transactions.” The Share Acquisitions were, and will continue to be, funded through a combination of cash equity injected to the Issuer by funds affiliated with Apollo and funds drawn under the BidCo Loan. In addition to providing €285 million of committed debt capacity to fund the Share Acquisitions, the Bidco Loan Facility also provides that the Bidco Loan Facility may be utilized for the issuance of cash confirmation letters that ----- are, or may be, required by CONSOB in connection with the MTO.

Pro Forma EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 also includes one-off costs related to the Share Acquistions amounting to €11.0 million. (a) The perimeter adjustment (i) for the year ended December 31, 2020 gives effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition as if it was consummated on January 1, 2020 and represents the EBITDA of the Paprinsa business from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020; and (ii) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 gives effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition as if it was consummated on October 1, 2020 and represents the EBITDA of the Paprinsa business from October 1, 2020 to July 1, 2021, which is the date on which it was acquired by the RdM Group. (b) Management adjustments include (i) €5.7 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and €3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 of costs relating to payments to employees for severance indemnities as part of restructuring activities and extraordinary bonuses, (ii) €2.0 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 of transaction costs relating to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal and (iii) €0.4 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and €2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the shutdown of the Ovaro and Villa Santa Lucia mills (2020 only) and other non-recurring items, partially offset by (i) €0.7 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and (ii) €0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 of costs relating to agent commissions that will not be recharged subsequent to the La Rochette Disposal. Although management believes these items are unusual, non-recurring or unrepresentative of our underlying performance, there can be no assurance that we will not incur these or similar costs in the future. (c) Changes in the price of raw materials are ordinarily passed along to our customers after a lag of a few months when new orders are placed. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations — Key Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations — The pass through of price fluctuations of raw materials and energy (mainly gas) into the sales prices for our products.” Over the course of 2021, abnormal market conditions have resulted in_ significant increase in the price for recycled fibers, which has intensified the effect this lag has had upon our results. The raw materials normalization, adjustment we present here is intended to adjust for this effect. We calculate this raw materials normalization adjustment by multiplying each month’s actual volumes to the immediately subsequent month’s order price starting in January 2021. In the case of extraordinary situations, we have a clause in our sales terms and conditions, approved by the order contracts, that allows us to apply prices increases retroactively, which was seen in the retroactive price increases in November 2021. The figures below present further details concerning the calculation of the raw material normalization adjustment. _Figure 1 — Source: Company Information. RDM EBITDA Normalization calculation Figure 2 — Source: Company Information. Eska EBITDA Normalization calculation_ (d) The cost savings initiatives adjustment represents our estimate of future cost savings we anticipate we will be able to achieve within the next year and primarily relate to operational efficiencies, improved energy generation systems and cost synergies resulting from the further integration of Paprinsa. Synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the ----- information available to us at this time and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating cost synergies and the associated costs required to achieve these synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to a variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties. We cannot assure you that the information on which we have based our assumptions will not change or that we will be able to realize any of the as-yet unrealized cost savings synergies or other benefits we believe are achievable through these initiatives. (e) One-off pro forma costs for the Share Acquisitions reflects estimated acquisition-related costs that we expect to be incurred by the Issuer and include professional, legal and advisory fees. As described in the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled, “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial _Information,”Pro Forma EBITDA was derived from pro forma financial information that gave effect_ to the Share Acquisitions, among other things, as if they were consummated on January 1, 2020. Accordingly, the adjustment for one-off transction costs related to the Share Acquisitions has been reflected in our Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Demand for our products, which is primarily driven by demand for our customers’ end products, such as industrial and consumer packaging, closely follows global economic conditions. Sustained economic downturns characterized by declines in consumer and government spending, business investment or construction activity typically result in decreased demand for various forms of packaging which, in turn, could negatively affect the demand for our products. Any changes to the central banks’ monetary policy positions in response to vigorous growth rates or any turmoil in the capital and credit markets could result in decreased availability of credit, which could have an adverse effect on the global trade and economy and, consequently, on the markets for our products. Any restrictions on free trade, such as customs, import taxes or other forms of increased protectionism or even forms of trade war, could adversely affect global trade and the global economy and therefore have an adverse effect on our business operations. Economic conditions may also be affected by various additional events that are beyond our control, such as natural disasters and epidemics, such as the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”). The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world, and caused the temporary closure of many production sectors and a consequent recessionary effect. As a result of the outbreak of the pandemic, governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures in an attempt to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders and business shutdowns. The pandemic and the measures instituted by governmental authorities and associated responses to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to: - total or partial shutdowns of one or more of our mill, warehousing or distribution facilities, including but not limited to, as a result of illness, government restrictions or other workforce disruptions; - the failure of third parties on which we rely, including but not limited to those that supply our raw materials and other necessary operating materials, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so; - higher employee compensation costs, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees; - a disruption or delay in executing strategic capital initiatives, such as, for example, mill operational improvement programs, due to travel restrictions and/or health and safety concerns limiting access to our sites; and - a rise in anti-globalist policies with border checks on both goods and people becoming more stringent and national interests promoted. ----- Due, in part, to COVID-19, and similarly to the other players operating in our industry we experienced uncertainty around customs clearances, which introduced uncertainty into worldwide on-time in-full deliveries. Should the current economic climate and macroeconomic scenario deteriorate, for example as a result of geopolitical uncertainty, trade tensions and/or the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased economic slowdown could result which, if sustained over any significant length of time, could cause disruption to us, our employees, mills, markets, suppliers and customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"Our business depends on the continued and uninterrupted supply of raw materials used in our products. If we are unable to secure sufficient quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials rises, it could negatively affect our ability to meet our customers’ demands and materially adversely affect our financial results.","The main raw material required in the manufacture of our products, such as cartonboard in our WLC segment or solidboard in our SB sector, is paper for recycling. We source recycled paper from local industries and commercial companies as well as local municipal paper collections, mostly in the form of fiber-based packaging, newspapers and magazines. Our production levels could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to supply us with raw materials at anticipated levels, but we are ready to cope with potential fluctuations in the supplied volumes by differentiating the sources among different countries and suppliers. While we would seek to find alternative sources of raw materials in the event of a significant interruption or limitation in the supply of these production inputs from our current suppliers, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Any economic slowdown could also lead to decreased capacity at our suppliers or supplies existing the market. As a result, should the demand for our products increase faster than anticipated, there may not be sufficient volume of raw materials to meet the increased needs or the price of these inputs may increase. This could result in production delays and an increase in costs, and, if such delays are prolonged or cost increases are substantial, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Several factors could affect the short- and long-term supply and price of raw materials in the regions in which we operate, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and delivery disruptions (including labor disputes) at our suppliers, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the decrease of quality and availability of recycled paper as a result of the temporary closure of some sectors or lack of labor in the waste paper collection chain. Additionally, other companies, whether or not in our industry, could seek to purchase the same raw materials from our procurement areas and adversely change regional market dynamics, resulting in insufficient quantities of raw material and price increases. For example, the price of scrap paper (from which recycled fiber is made) has been highly volatile during recent years. Historically, the volatility of the paper for recycling prices generate a direct impact in the recycled board selling prices allowing the continuity of the business profitability, even with some time lags. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced a fiber shortage due to reductions in collection rates. We have experienced shutdowns of recycling plants due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as reduced availability of input materials. Furthermore, our business model is dependent upon a circular economy and our ability to source recycled fibers. For further detail, see also “Business — Our Production Process — Circular Business Model.” For the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the La Rochette Disposal), 94% of the fibrous material we used was recycled and over 83% of all materials used consisted of renewable materials. The prices of several recycled fibers that we use are historically volatile. Also, the supply and quality of the recycled materials can vary since a portion of our recycled input materials are sourced from mixed waste. Shortages of the raw materials used in our production and the associated increases in prices have led to significant rise in our operating costs in the past, and these increases could impact our ability to meet our customers’ demand. Since our sales contracts generally do not set forth predefined provisions for the pass-through of our input costs to our customers and we usually achieve this outcome through the renegotiation of the contracts with our customers, negative and adverse implications typically result from the time discrepancy between the increases in the raw material prices and the completion of the renegotiation with each of our customers. Furthermore, if we are unable to increase our product prices sufficiently to maintain our margins when the prices of raw materials increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,The cyclical nature of our industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of operations.,"We principally generate revenue through the sale of WLC and SB, used for the production of folding cartonboard packaging, corrugated cardboard packaging and SB packaging from recycled fibers. Our mills primarily sell the cartonboard we produce to our third-party customers in the packaging industry. Our operating results are therefore impacted by the packaging industry’s historical cyclical pattern, with periods of overcapacity and resulting pressure on pricing of packaging products such as corrugated containers and, in turn, their component materials such as containerboard and corrugated board. This cyclicality results, in part, from significant imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand, containerboard production capacity cannot be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions, due to the high capital intensity of facilities such as cartonboard mills (which generally continue production as long as fiber prices are sufficient to cover their marginal costs), the long lead time between the planning and completion of new cartonboard mills and the fact that new additions of cartonboard capacity tend to be large relative to the overall demand for the product. On the other hand, significant cartonboard price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has exceeded demand. In addition, there is the potential to convert graphic and newsprint paper machines into cartonboard machines which has happened recently both in Europe and the United States, and which may contribute to overcapacity. Consequently, the cartonboard industry has experienced periods of substantial overcapacity from time to time, and we expect periods of overcapacity to occur again in the future. To the extent such overcapacity affects the European market, it would likely result in a negative impact on prices in general, including the prices we are able to charge customers for our products. In the absence of sufficient economic growth to generate increased demand or the closure of facilities (either temporarily or permanently) to mitigate the effect of overcapacity, the addition of new capacity can cause a period of regional overcapacity, which may lead to downward pricing and margin pressure. In periods of overcapacity, industry participants may stop operating certain of their production facilities periodically to reduce inventory levels. In the past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to reduced demand by taking downtime and by rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity. In the event that the industry as a whole does not take sufficient downtime or other measures to reduce capacity during any periods of overcapacity, this could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. Overcapacity in the European cartonboard market could be further exacerbated by an increase of imports from other regions and/or a decrease of exports by European producers to other regions, as a result of a variety of factors. For example, in the event that producers in other regions (particularly the United States and China) experience overcapacity within their own local and regional markets, they may seek to increase their level of exports to Europe and do so at lower pricing levels. This could adversely affect our selling prices and profitability. In addition, the level of exports of cartonboard from or to Europe also depends on relevant freight rates and currency rates. A strong euro, for example, can have a negative effect on (U.S. dollardenominated) exports by European cartonboard manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply and demand balance and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other European manufacturers who ship products in cartonboard packaging, resulting in lower European demand for cartonboard packaging, and therefore for our cartonboard. See also “— We sell our products in a number _of countries and are consequently exposed to currency fluctuations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of energy could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"The production processes at our mills use a substantial amount of heat and electricity (mainly selfproduced using natural gas, from natural gas fuel in combined heat and power plants). As result, energy is one of the key components of our production costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, energy costs represented 14% of our total costs (as compared to 15% in 2019). Historically, in circumstances where we have been exposed to input volatility, we have protected our margins by hedging contract prices and by passing through increases in input costs to customers. In the past, when prices for the materials we use in production have increased, we have generally been successful in renegotiating prices with our customers within two months of the increase in input costs. However, under ----- future circumstances, there is the risk that our customers will not accept similar renegotiations. Furthermore, some of our competitors might be able to adopt a more customer-friendly approach in reacting to the increases in input prices, resulting in our customers preferring our competitors’ products to ours. In 2019, energy prices, and in particular natural gas, declined markedly following their high in 2018. In 2020, 78% of our energy costs and energy consumption were dominated by natural gas. Since January 2021, gas prices in Europe have risen more than 300% adversely affecting the cost of energy supply for quotas of volume of energy inputs not hedged. In general, while our mills have high self-sufficiency of electricity which makes us less dependent on purchased power at the moment, there can be no assurance that in the future we would not need to increase our dependence on external energy suppliers following electrification and decarbonization programs. In this case, any fluctuation in price and supply of electricity could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs. A significant increase in the price of natural gas or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas to our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.5,We operate in a highly competitive industry and measures taken by national governments or the EU may distort competition in the industry.,"Today the cartonboard packaging industry competes with the plastic and reusable transit packs industry, especially in certain markets such as packaging for direct food contact applications. It is possible that the manufacturers of plastic and reusable transit packs will expand their presence even in the markets in which we currently operate and may occupy a significant position in such markets. This could be due both to our potential inability to keep up with innovation, product development and cost, as well as to the general ability of the cartonboard market to respond to changing market requirements. The cartonboard production industry in which we operate is mature, capital intensive and highly competitive. We compete with several large multinational manufacturers, but also with numerous regional and/or specialised manufacturers in the market for our products. Although we implemented our three-year transformation plan (“Transformation Plan”), which was aimed at expanding and repositioning our business to maintain our European leadership position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the goals laid out in our Transformation Plan and/or that our competitors would not achieve greater market presence and/or obtain more financial and other resources than us, allowing them to make investments in manufacturing facilities and/or product development at levels at which we may not be able to compete. Furthermore, some of our competitors may be able to adjust their product prices more effectively in response to input price changes. The competitive environment and imbalances between supply and demand of raw materials have been principal factors behind fluctuations in product prices in recent years. In addition, we are subject to the risk that local competitors following lower social responsibility standards enter the market with lower compliance, labor and other costs than ours, and we may not be able to compete with such companies for the most price-conscious customers. We may not be able to maintain our current price levels, or increase the prices for our products, unless there is a strong demand for packaging products or a further decrease in production capacity. Decreases in demand or unfavourable price levels for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, competition in the cartonboard production industry may be distorted by measures taken by national governments or the EU. For example, a number of national governments and the EU have taken measures to support companies operating in these industries in response to an economic downturn or to support economic development in particular regions. These measures may include direct support to build new production capacity in an industry already characterized by overcapacity and indirect support through tax and other incentives that are not available to all market participants. Such support measures may have a significant effect on the supply/demand balance in the industry and, therefore, distort competition in the market. In addition, competition in the industry may be distorted by regulatory measures that, for example, support specific energy sources or impose additional taxes, charges or penalties for certain practices. Such regulatory measures may require us to make significant additional investments or change our trade practices, which could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability and on our ability to compete against companies that are not subject to the same requirements. ----- As our business is concentrated in certain geographic regions and along certain product lines, increased competition in those regions and production lines could lead to loss of market share, materially adversely affecting our financial results. Any failure by us to compete successfully with other producers of cartonboard could result in the loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

This, in turn, has led to lower product prices, which may reduce earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business has in the past faced downward pricing pressure, including as a result of standardization in the markets in which we operate. We are likely to continue to be exposed to such factors in the future. In circumstances where we are unable to adjust our cost base or achieve economies of scale comparable to our competition in these markets, pricing pressure may have a material adverse effect on our margins and the profitability of the relevant business and our market share. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. The paper-based packaging industry is characterized by a high level of price competition as well as other competitive factors, including innovation, design, quality and service. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Pricing pressure may arise from, among other things, limited demand growth and existing overcapacity in the market in question, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale and create excess product supply, the ability of competitors to operate or successfully relocate or open production facilities in countries where production costs are lower than those in which we operate and the access of competitors to new technology which we do not possess.

As we are at the beginning of the supply chain, we are highly dependent on the trends and level of demand in the end-markets in which our customers operate, including the food, pharmaceutical and hygiene, paper, packaging and printed products, chemical, and industrial/manufacturing market segments, which are in turn affected by general economic conditions. Therefore, changes in consumer preferences for specific types of packaging may affect the demand for cartonboard in general, and demand for specific grades of cartonboard. Regulatory changes also could affect consumer preferences, production requirements, availability and price of raw materials (especially affecting recycling rates) and energy usage, which in turn could lead to increased production costs or reduced demand for our products in general. Our ability to correctly anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet the new requirements on a competitive and economic basis will require innovation, continued capacity management and structure development and will be crucial to successful positioning of our brand.

As of December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal), we had over 2,500 customers, principally from the converting and printing industry, with our top 10 and top 100 customers accounting for 21% and 58% of our sales, respectively. The contractual relationship between us and our clients is rarely governed by written framework agreements. Rather, most of our clients place single purchase orders on a recurrent basis, for the on-going business relationship, consistently with the market practice in the field in which we operate. A loss of our most significant customers, if not replaced on similar terms, could have a material adverse effect on our future prospects. Many of our top customers, based on revenue, are located in Europe. If we are unable to successfully enter new markets outside of Europe and reach a geographically more diversified group of customers, our business will continue to be highly dependent on demand for our products in Europe. If our customers are unable to stay competitive to meet their obligations under the contracts they entered into with us, our operating results and cash flows may be negatively affected and we may be forced to renegotiate the existing contract on terms that are less favorable and/or at reduced volumes in order to preserve our relationships with our customers. Our customers may also decide not to renew contracts with us on the existing terms, or at all, as they may find new cartonboard providers with more competitive pricing. Some of our customers could also exit their current business or be acquired by other companies that purchase cartonboard from other providers. If we are unable to maintain our existing customer contracts or to expand into new geographical areas, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

This risk is especially present in Italy, which remains one of Europe’s most fragile economies, historically characterized by prolonged payment terms resulting in significant exposure to the risk that customers will default on their payment obligations to us. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot rule out that at least some of our counterparties could experience financial difficulties, with potential adverse consequences, at least in the short-term, relating to payment times and credit ratings. While we have implemented certain credit procedures and policies in our contracts that aim to limit our exposure to consumer credit risk (such as insurance agreements entered into with a leading credit insurance company and various agreements entered into for the non-recourse assignment of receivables), these protectionary measures may be insufficient to guard against the risk of loss resulting from delayed payments, nonpayment or nonperformance by our contract counterparties. If the creditworthiness of our customers deteriorates unexpectedly, they may not be able to pay for the products they order on time, or not at all, or may not be able to otherwise perform under their contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, business, prospects and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

While most of our sales are directly managed by our employees from the sales offices, in order to penetrate those geographic areas that are not physically close to our sales offices, we employ third-party sales agents that report to our relevant sales offices. We expect to continue to rely on these third-party sale agents to generate a portion of our sales in the future while we work to grow our direct sales force. The impairment or termination of our relationships with the third-party sales agents for any reason, or the failure of these parties to diligently sell our products and comply with applicable laws and regulations, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. We generally have direct relationship with our clients. We have full control of our customer portfolio and directly invoice customers, while our third-party sales agents mainly act as a point of contact in relation to our products and are rarely involved in the purchase order finalization between us and a customer. However, we ----- may be liable in the event of breaches of legal and regulatory obligations, including consumer protection laws and obligations, by the third-party sales agents. While our success is partially dependent on the willingness and ability of our third-party sales agents to diligently sell our products, we cannot guarantee that they will be successful in marketing our products. Actions by the third-party sales agents that are beyond our control could result in poor representation of our products leading to flat or declining sales in that territory, harm to the reputation of our company or our products or result in legal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the risk of losing customers, the terms of local laws and our agreements with our third-party sales agents could make it difficult for us to replace a sales agent we feel is underperforming. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy and our third-party sales agents do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Additionally, our ability to receive services from the third-party sales agents may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected. This risk might increase due to increased reliance on, and use of, the third-party sales agents in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

As a result, any disruptions to transportation services and/or fluctuations in transportation costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations.","Our cartonboard production and product delivery processes require dependable and cost-effective transportation systems and a strong distribution network. We mainly adopt an outsourcing model for our logistics needs and are highly dependent on external service providers to ship our products. While we plan our need for transportation services in advance, in particular, by keeping track of and analyzing the sales forecasts of the market and holding internal integrated business planning meetings in order to balance our production capacity based on the market needs, there can be no assurance that any disruptions to transportation services could not temporarily impair our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner, potentially adversely affecting our reputation and competitiveness. Any such disruption could arise as a result of shortages of, or damage to, trucks and vessels, weather-related problems, accidents and mechanical difficulties, strikes, restricted access to traditional global shipping routes, transportation disruptions due to natural disasters or pandemics or other events. Any potential increases in transportation costs due to rise in fuel prices or other national or global market conditions could also adversely affect our business. While we aim to mitigate these risks by entering into fixed-price shipping contracts where available in order to prevent our supply chain from being jeopardized, we still cannot guarantee that our transportation costs will not increase in the future. Accordingly, if the primary transportation services we use to transport our products are disrupted, if we are unable to find alternative transportation providers or if we are unable to pass increased transportation costs to our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any of these events may negatively impact our reputation, and, in certain circumstances, may constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products and may even lead to termination and non-renewal of our contracts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

If we experience a prolonged failure of the equipment at these ports or otherwise are subject to port congestion or closures, including for security or weather-related reasons, we could be unable to fulfil our obligations to our customers or incur substantial additional transportation costs. Moreover, we rely on various ports of destination, as well as third parties who provide stevedoring or other services at our ports of shipment and destination to transport our product to our customers. In addition to loss of access to ports, production may also be affected by loss of access to public roads, as some of our facilities do not have a direct access to a public road and owners of the properties may have the right to restrict the access to the roads connecting to a public road. A prolonged delay or inability to fulfil our obligations under our contracts and to meet our customers’ expectations, might result in our preferring our competitors’ products to ours. ----- If, in the future, we lose access to the ports or public roads or our third-party service providers fails to uphold their contractual obligations, this may impact our ability to fulfil our obligations under our contracts, cause interruptions to our shipping schedule and cause us to incur substantial additional costs or to suffer reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Potential impacts of changes in the applicable regulatory frameworks could include higher costs and capital expenditure to meet new environmental requirements, expropriation of assets, imposition of royalties or other taxes targeted at our industry, and requirements for local ownership or beneficiation, all of which could have impact on our business and investment activities. For instance, there is a wide variety of laws and regulations especially in the EU and in certain EU Member States in relation to safety and inertness of all Food Contact Materials (“FCMs”). FCMs are materials that may come in contact with edible products. The regulation aims to secure that materials do not, for example, release their constituents into food at levels harmful to human health or change food composition, taste and odour in an unacceptable way. Given that many of our products are used by customers operating in the food and pharmaceutical packaging industry, any increased or amended regulation relating to FCMs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Compliance by us with environmental requirements is a significant component of our operations, and substantial resources are required to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to manage environmental risk. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, particularly relating to waste water discharges, air emissions, solid waste management and hazardous chemical disposal. These laws and regulations, the violation of which can lead to substantial fines, injunctions or criminal penalties, have generally become stricter in recent years and may in the future become more stringent. Further, our commitment to environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) goals is public and it is part of our company identity. Thus, breaching environmental laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us not only for the economic impact of potential fines, injunctions or criminal penalties, but also in terms of reputational damage. In addition, changes in regulations such as the EU’s climate and environmental policy and increasing new requirements to limit carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides emissions may increase production, logistics and other costs and thereby have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.15,We are exposed to risk related to climate change.,"The cartonboard production process is energy intensive and contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases, the main cause of climate change. We have adopted energy management systems (ISO 50001) for several of our mills, certified by accredited third-party bodies and are in a process of transition towards production processes and energy sources with a lower environmental impact. We also use high efficiency co-generation plants and cleaner fuels in our efforts to manage the risks of volatility in the purchase price of emission allowances under the Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). While we have implemented a prevention program aimed at reducing the impacts associated with the occurrence of natural disasters, the presence of our mills in locations potentially subject to climate change events such as rising river flows and increased frequency and intensity of storms and wildfires exposes us to potential risks of disruption to operations, which could have adverse material impact on our business and profitability. We may also become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organisations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Various governmental and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions and energy policies. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the new or expanded limitations. Due to the uncertainty in the ----- regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our operations. Furthermore, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.

Further, the efficient performance of our multi-mill concept highly depends on the regular and proper functioning of our IT systems. In particular, we employ IT tools to coordinate production across our network of mills, aiming at balancing the availability of our products across our network, at ensuring greater proximity between customers and the mill that is manufacturing the products they consume and at increasing the comfort our customers can take in the reliability of their supply chain. Our focus on coordination within the multi-mill network also allows us to monitor and better respond to market volatility arising from rapid changes in local demand or changes in production at individual mills. Our IT systems may be damaged or interrupted by increases in usage, human error, damaged hardware, our suppliers’ failure to follow service level agreements, network connection issues, cyber security issues, natural hazards or disasters or similarly disruptive events. Cybersecurity risks, in particular, have a potentially significant effect on our business and are continuously monitored. The migration of IT infrastructures to the cloud as well as the scale of cyber-attacks, the nature of which is constantly changing, not only affect IT infrastructures and business operations but can lead to possible breaches or theft of sensitive and personal data. As result of this, our IT systems play an important role in our operations, making the security of our sites and IT systems as well as cloud security and protection against cybersecurity incidents crucial to the smooth running of our operations. Any IT failure pertaining to availability, access or system security could potentially result in disruption of our core activities and personnel, as well as of our key commercial strategy and business organization, including the multi-mill concept, and could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial performance. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to unauthorized access to our systems, significant service disruptions, a partial or complete shutdown of our mills for a short or extended period, corruption or misappropriation of assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data or disruption of business processes. Such attacks could occur for the purpose of sabotage and financial blackmail, to extract business-sensitive, confidential or personal information, or to cause corruption of information or disruption of business processes. Our cybersecurity measures may not detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to protect against these attacks. If we fail to identify security threats that could disrupt our business, or if our cyber risk insurance policies would be insufficient, or if we are unable to avert future attacks or security breaches, we could be subject to significant legal liability and exposure to financial losses. We may, for example, be subject to operational disruptions, increased costs to identify and remediate vulnerabilities or reconstruct lost data, damage to reputation and commercial relationships, ransom demand, claims from customers and suppliers, all of which could materially impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

For example, over the last two years we have installed a new gas turbine and a new washing equipment to reduce waste and improve quality and energy efficiency at our Villa Santa Lucia mill ----- and constructed a steam boiler at Santa Giustina mill. While these capital investment projects are aimed at reducing our variable costs, increasing the capacity and efficiency and improving safety and quality of product, due to the complexity of the machinery we utilize, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in achieving these goals. Moreover, we could encounter severe problems in the ramp-up and operations of new or existing production facilities or we could run into issues with securing access to sufficient funding to fund necessary capital improvements in the future. If our investments in our mills and machineries are not effectively undertaken and/or if we are not able to raise sufficient funds for any required capital improvement projects, or if the additional production capacity is not matched with corresponding increases in demand, such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

For example, in 2019, we experienced a roof collapse in our mill in Santa Giustina. The loss in connection with this incident is expected to exceed €2.0 million and is still in the process of being discussed with the insurance provider. In addition, our Villa Santa Lucia plant was shut down from February 7, 2020 to March 1, 2020 due to the seizure of the sewage treatment plant owned by the Consortium Cosilam, the supplier of sewage treatment services to the Villa Santa Lucia plant. Although we carry insurance covering losses at our mills and insurance to cover interruptions in our business, such insurance will be subject to limitations such as deductibles and maximum liability amounts and therefore may not cover all of our potential losses. We may also incur losses that are outside of the coverage of our insurance policies. As a result, we could experience significant losses if any of our mills were damaged or ceased operation for any other reason.

Our customers expect high quality products, which underscores the importance of consistency and repeatability in production processes to ensure customer satisfaction. Furthermore, certain of our products are used in the food industry, where key customers have stringent requirements regarding the products they purchase. The consequences of quality or safety issues, due to, for example, accidental or malicious raw material contamination or due to supply chain contamination caused by human error, sabotage or equipment fault, could be severe. While we aim to detect potential quality issues and hazards as early as possible, detected faults or defects in our products or in product descriptions discovered at a critical point in our production chain could interrupt production in the unit concerned and disturb the entire mill’s operations. For example, in 2018, the back of a cartonboard was contaminated with process oil (grease) at our former La Rochette plant, without any health consequences for anybody.

We have adopted a “Zero Accident” policy and work towards continuous improvement in injury rates. Our goal is to provide accident-free workplace by encouraging a company-wide safety culture with everyone (including our contractors, suppliers and on-site visitors) responsible for making every workday healthy and safe. At the same time, we recognize that our employees frequently operate heavy machinery and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which ----- could subject them and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. For example, two accidents occurred at the Ovaro plant in 2018, one resulting in the death of one of our employees and the other one resulting in very serious injuries to another of our employees. Also, one accident involving an employee occurred at one of Eska’s plants in 2017.

The implemented measures have included the restructuring of our business areas and management and mill divestments to address overcapacity and improve profitability. In addition, a number of initiatives have been identified by our management to further strengthen this saving process. While cost-reducing measures have generated the targeted savings, we may not be able to realize the full intended benefits of these measures or any additional initiatives that we may undertake the future. Actual cost savings may differ materially from original estimates for a number of reasons. In addition, cost reduction measures are based on current conditions and do not take into account future cost increases that may result from changes in the industry or our operations, including the overall weaker business environment and any uncertainty in the global markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, our estimates of the potential cost savings associated with initiatives are inherently uncertain, and our ability to implement these initiatives and realize the anticipated costs savings (or any cost savings at all) depends on a number of factors, including factors beyond our control. Further, some of the measures taken by us are irreversible and we may incur significant costs should we want to recommence certain terminated operations in the future as a result of, for example, industry consolidation or unexpected changes in industry trends.

Additional acquisitions may also expose us to new liabilities.,"As part of our business strategy and development, we aim to transform ourselves from a traditional cartonboard producer to a customer-focused renewable materials company. Such transformation depends on our ability to understand the needs of our customers and find the best possible ways to serve them with the right offering and product portfolio, delivered through innovation, organic growth and selective mergers and acquisitions. We may seek opportunities through mergers with, or acquisitions of, pulp companies to stay competitive or to enhance our position in our core areas of operation or to expand outside of current businesses. For example, on July 1, 2021, we completed the Paprinsa Acquisition and on July 13, 2021, we completed the Eska Acquisition. Risks relating to mergers and acquisitions include unidentified liabilities of the companies we may acquire or merge with, the possible inability to successfully integrate and manage acquired operations and personnel as well as the risk that the anticipated economies of scale or synergies do not materialize. In addition, past practices by acquired companies, such as in relation to pollution, competition law breaches or corruption, could result in additional costs for us and cause reputational damage. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition or merger opportunities and might not be able to carry out acquisitions or mergers on attractive terms. Failure to participate in industry consolidation may have an adverse effect on our strategic competitive position. Regulation of merger or acquisition activity by competition authorities may also limit our ability to make future acquisitions or mergers. We have in the past recorded significant impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and may be required to do so in the future in connection with any future acquisitions. We have made some divestments in recent years in order to focus our operations. For example, on April 30, 2021, we finalized the disposal of our FBB business through the sale of a 100% interest in our subsidiary R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S. Any future divestments may be affected by many factors that are beyond our ----- control, such as the availability of bank financing to potential buyers, interest rates and competitors’ capacity, and may also lead to exposure to indemnity claims. Furthermore, divestments may involve additional costs due to historical and unaccounted liabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to divert assets in a profitable way, or that such divestments will be possible on acceptable terms, or at all. The market situation may also affect our ability to accurately predict the length of time needed for any acquisitions or divestments. Any transactions may also require extensive management attention, which would divert the attention of our management away from the ongoing business.

As far as our business is concerned, this exposure is particularly related to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, a currency in which a significant part of revenues from overseas markets is denominated and, as far as costs are concerned, purchases of certain raw materials and energy factors. The value of the U.S. dollar has fluctuated significantly against the euro in recent years, including periods in which the value of the U.S. dollar has significantly declined against the euro. We report our financial results in euro and are consequently subject to currency translation risk because a significant portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the euro. We also incur foreign currency translation risk to the extent that our subsidiaries’ assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in currencies other than euro. In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into euro at then applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the euro versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. We hedge some of this currency translation risk by matching foreign currency assets with liabilities denominated in the same currency and by entering into derivative transactions. The Notes will be denominated and payable in Euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than Euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the Euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the Euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Our insurance is reviewed periodically to ensure that it sufficiently covers our business risks and is reflective of the changes in our business; however, it is possible that the level of insurance we maintain may not be appropriate for the risks to our business or may not provide sufficient cover for all potential claims. Certain types of losses may not be covered by our insurance policies and may be either completely or partially uninsurable or not insurable on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we may not be able to obtain future insurance coverage at current levels or at all, and our premiums and deductibles may increase to an extent that we may choose to reduce our policy limits, increase our deductibles or retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from the coverage. Among other factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse political developments, security concerns and natural disasters in any country in which we operate may materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums for available coverage and additional exclusions from coverage.

Additionally, we are subject to audits and other measures by the tax authorities of different countries and there can be no assurances that tax increases or other consequences for delay would not be imposed on us based on these audits and other measures. Major developments in tax policy leading increases in our tax burden would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Moreover, while we generally believe that we have appropriately remitted all taxes based on our interpretation of applicable law, it is possible that some taxing jurisdictions may attempt to assess additional taxes and penalties on us if the applicable authorities do not agree with our positions.

The final shareholding of the Issuer in RdM is dependent on the results of the MTO, which are currently unknown and cannot be guaranteed. On October 26, 2021, the Issuer disclosed to the public, the occurrence of the obligation to promote the MTO. On the same date the Issuer submitted the MTO offer document to CONSOB for approval. Following expiration of the MTO Subscription Period, the Issuer may not be able to purchase 100% of the ordinary shares of RdM. Until MTO Completion and the Issuer having gained 100% of the ordinary shares of RdM, minority shareholders will continue to hold the outstanding ordinary shares of RdM. The MTO is a proceeding regulated by the Financial Services Act, which could potentially be time consuming. The timing to complete the process may also be longer than expected due to events outside the Issuer’s control. The presence of minority interests in RdM could impose significant limitations and restrictions on the process whereby the Issuer may exercise its right as majority direct shareholder of RdM. In the event that the Issuer does not obtain 100% of the ordinary shares of RdM, RdM may still qualify as a company with shares highly distributed among the public pursuant to Article 2325-bis of the Italian Civil Code. In this case, RdM would still be subject to specific requirements under the Italian legal framework (including disclosure requirements) regardless of the Delisting. ----- In any case, certain general limitations and restrictions may potentially delay or impair the ability of Issuer to procure that RdM timely approves certain transactions contemplated in this Offering Memorandum, including, among others, the Note Guarantee, the granting of Collateral, the entering into of the Intercreditor Agreement and Facility Agreement. For example all transactions involving the Issuer and RdM and its subsidiaries on the other hand (including the borrowing of the Proceeds Loan the granting of the Note Guarantee and security in favor of the Notes), would be subject to (i) arms’ length terms and corporate benefit requirements and directors’ duties to act in the best interest of RdM; (ii) for as long as minority interest exist, any such transactions may be subject to additional scrutiny by the minority shareholders; and (iii) for as long as RdM remains listed, certain additional corporate actions and approvals may also be required in accordance with applicable regulation. In particular, for so long as RdM remains a listed company, certain transaction involving RdM and the Issuer would be subject to Article 2391-bis of the Italian Civil Code and CONSOB Regulation No. 17221 dated 12 March 2010 (and subsequent updates) concerning transactions with related parties. Such rules require that transactions of greater relevance with related parties or with associated persons shall be approved by the board of directors subject to prior grounded favourable opinion of a related parties committee composed only of independent directors. In the event that the opinion of said committee is not favourable, the transaction cannot be carried out if it is not approved with the favourable vote of the majority of the unrelated voting shareholders, provided that these represent at the shareholders’ meeting at least 10% of the share capital with voting rights (so-called “whitewash”). As a result, there can be no assurance that certain transactions contemplated in this Offering Memorandum, including, among others, the Guarantee by RdM, the granting of Collateral by RdM, the entering into of the Intercreditor Agreement and Facility Agreement as well the Merger (or any merger of RdM with an unlisted Apollo entity), and consequently, the Delisting is approved by RdM in the timeframe described in this Offering Memorandum, or at all. Furthermore, the Issuer’s obligations in relation to RdM and its subsidiaries under the covenants described in “Description of the Notes”are limited to a requirement to use commercially reasonable endeavors to procure compliance to the extent the Issuer is able to do so having regard to the proportion of shares it holds (directly or indirectly) in RdM. To the extent that the Issuer is unable to exercise full control of RdM, we cannot assure you that RdM and its subsidiaries will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had their compliance under those covenants been required. The final shareholding of the Issuer in RdM is dependent on the results of the MTO, which are currently unknown and cannot be guaranteed. Depending on the number of ordinary shares of RdM that the Issuer will have been able to purchase, the Issuer will do one of the following: (a) if at the Initial MTO Settlement Date the Issuer holds 90% or less of the issued share capital of RdM represented by ordinary shares, then the Issuer may either: (i) if the relevant conditions thereto are met, reopen the tender offer period, and/or (ii) terminate the MTO and aim to achieve the Delisting through the Merger of RdM into Rimini BidCo S.p.A. (or via a merger of RdM into an unlisted Apollo entity); (b) if at the Initial MTO Settlement Date the Issuer holds more than 90% but less than 95% of the issued share capital of RdM represented by ordinary shares, then the Issuer shall be subject to the Sell Out Procedure; or (c) if at the Initial MTO Settlement Date (or after the Sell Out Procedure) the Issuer holds 95% or more of the issued share capital of RdM represented by ordinary shares, then the Issuer shall be entitled to exercise its right to initiate the Squeeze Out Procedure. In all these cases, there might be delays in the completion of the procedures described above. Furthermore, there is a risk that certain conditions set forth in this Offering Memorandum, including that the MTO Completion shall occur by the Escrow Longstop Date (see also “The Transactions”), may not be fulfilled or, to the extent possible, waived by the Issuer, as a result of which the MTO may be affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to do so) that these transactions will not be treated as resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Merger and the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by RdM as resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations — Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would recognize gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange and would have a new holding period and new tax basis in each series of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of one or more series of the Notes at the time of the Merger is less than the principal amount of such series of Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such series of Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount.

The Merger will be undertaken pursuant to the provisions of Article 2501-bis of the Italian civil code. In order to complete the Merger, there are various steps that we must take including the preparation of a merger plan, a report by the directors of the companies involved in the Merger (relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and a report by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing the sustainability of debt at the level of the company resulting from the Merger. Our estimation of the time frame required to complete the Merger is based upon market practice for leveraged buyouts in Italy typically involving acquisition vehicles which, in our case, is an Italian joint stock company (società per azioni) where an independent expert is required to be appointed by the court which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Merger can be expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the independent expert will release its report or that the other steps required for the Merger will be taken in a timely manner, or at all. While the Indenture requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the Merger, which for the avoidance of doubt shall include considering the effects of dilution on the Apollo Funds, there is no requirement that the Merger be consummated, including within any specific period of time following the Completion Date, and failure to complete the Merger will not constitute an event of default under the Indenture. In this regard, it should be also noted that the Merger would represent a related parties transaction subject to the relevant applicable legislation. In particular, pursuant to the Related Parties Regulation, the Merger plan would be approved by the RdM Board of Directors subject to prior grounded favorable opinion of the RdM Related Parties Committee. In the event that the opinion of said Committee is not favorable, the approving resolution of the shareholders’ meeting could not be adopted if the Merger is not approved also with the favorable vote of the majority of the unrelated voting shareholders, provided that these represent at the shareholders’ meeting at least 10% of the share capital with voting rights (so-called “whitewash”).” Moreover, subject to certain exceptions, the Merger can only be implemented following the expiration of 60 days after the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolution approving the Merger, during which the creditors of the companies involved in the Merger are entitled to challenge the Merger. See “Description of the Notes — Security.” As a result of the consummation of the Merger, the Proceeds Loan will be extinguished, and the security interests over the intercompany receivables owed by the Initial Guarantor to the Issuer will be automatically terminated, and (i) in the event that Rimini BidCo S.p.A. is the surviving company of the Merger, the pledge over the share capital of RdM will be extinguished by operation of law, and (ii) in the event that RdM is the surviving company of the Merger, the pledge over the share capital of Rimini BidCo S.p.A. will be extinguished (or continue over the shares in the MergerCo received by Topco upon the Merger, as applicable) by operation ----- of law, and in each case Topco will grant (or re-confirm, as applicable) a first-priority security interest over the issued share capital of MergerCo owned by it. In the event we are unable to consummate the Merger, Rimini Bidco S.p.A. will remain as the Issuer. The final shareholding of the Issuer in RdM is dependent on the results of the MTO, which are currently unknown and cannot be guaranteed. If, as a result of the MTO Completion the Issuer holds less than 95% of the issued share capital of RdM, the Issuer will aim to achieve the Delisting through the Merger of RdM into Rimini BidCo S.p.A. (or through the merger of RdM with another unlisted Apollo entity). There is no assurance that shareholding percentage in MergerCo assigned to Topco upon such Merger will be equal to that held by the Issuer in Target immediately prior to the Merger, as a result, among other things, of the indebtedness of the Issuer (including the Bidco Loan or, as applicable, the Notes) and RdM at the time of Merger. The Collateral may be diluted accordingly, since the security interest for the Notes created over the shares representing the entire share capital of the Issuer may be replaced upon Merger by security interest over shares in MergerCo representing a shareholding percentage in MergerCo held by Topco, which may be lower than the shareholding percentage held by the Issuer in RdM immediately prior to the Merger. Dilution of Collateral would similarly occur in case of Delisting achieved by way of a merger of RdM into a unlisted entity other than the Issuer, which would be carried out in accordance with applicable provisions of Italian law. See “Risk Factors — The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been _granted as security for the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_ It should be noted that the Merger could qualify, if applicable, as a “merger following an acquisition funded by financial indebtedness” with consequent applicability of Art. 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code by reason of the amounts disbursed in favor of the Issuer pursuant to the Bidco Facility Agreement or amounts outstanding under the Notes (as applicable depending on when such Merger is undertaken), in the case of a Merger between RdM and the Issuer. It is also specified that as a result of the Merger, the total indebtedness of RdM would be increased by an amount equal to the sums disbursed in favor of the Issuer pursuant to the Bidco Facility (as well as, where existing, the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility) and not repaid prior to or on the effective date of the aforementioned Merger. The Bidco Facility Agreement, further, provides the right of the Issuer to procure that TopCo, upon the occurrence of certain conditions (including granting a pledge over TopCo’s shares), shall assume, as substitute borrower, starting from the date of the Merger (the “Relevant Date”) the repayment obligations arising from the Bidco Facility Agreement in substitution of the Issuer and with consequent release of the same pursuant to Article 1273, second paragraph of the Italian Civil Code. As a consequence of the exercise thereof and as a condition thereto, the Bidco Facility Agreement provides for, inter alia, the obligation of TopCo to (i) allocate in full, with effect from the Relevant Date, the credit claimed by it in recourse against the Issuer as a result of the takeover, to the subscription of a capital increase with a premium to be resolved by the Issuer; (ii) repay the amounts for any reason due and not already repaid under the Bidco Facility Agreement through the use of the proceeds of a dividend payment or distribution of reserves by the company resulting from the Merger (the “Distribution” ); and (iii) make every reasonable effort to ensure that the proceeds of the Distribution in the event of a Merger are made available to TopCo as soon as possible and, in any case, within 60 days from the Relevant Date.

Therefore, the net proceeds of the Offering will not be allocated specifically to projects or business activities meeting environmental or sustainability criteria, or be subject to any other limitations associated with green bonds. Although we have committed to achieve the Sustainability Performance Targets, there can be no assurance of the extent to which we will be successful in doing so. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future investments we make in furtherance of the Sustainability Performance Targets will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact. Adverse environmental or social impacts may occur during the design, construction and operation of any investments that we make in furtherance of the Sustainability Performance Targets. Investments we make in furtherance of the Sustainability Performance Targets may become controversial or criticized by stakeholders. It will not be an event of default under the Notes, nor will we be required to repurchase or redeem the Notes, if we fail to meet the Sustainability Performance Targets. Moreover, should we fail to satisfy the Sustainability Performance Targets, we will be required to pay an increased margin or interest rate on the Notes, which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position. Should we satisfy the Sustainability Performance Targets, holders of Notes will not be entitled to an increase in the interest rate or margin, as applicable, on the Notes. ----- Moreover, key performance indicators on which our Sustainability Performance Targets are based are calculated internally by the Group based on broadly accepted industry standards. These standards and guidelines may change over time, which may affect the way in which we calculate our key performance indicators and may impact our ability to meet our Sustainability Performance Targets. The standards and guidelines continue to be reviewed by expert groups and include contributions from industry bodies, which may change going forward. Any change to our organic business development, the methodology and/or data sources used for calculating key performance indicators may result in a significant change in the Sustainability Performance Targets, key performance indicators and/or baseline. In such case, we will recalculate, in good faith, the levels of the relevant baseline, Sustainability Performance Targets and/or key performance indicators to reflect such changes. Any such change(s) may be made without the prior consultation of the holders of the Notes, to the extent it does not have a material adverse effect in the interests of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes.” We expect to report on an annual basis on progress on our key performance indicators, including an explanation of methodologies and supporting documentation used in such calculations, but a failure to do so will not constitute a default or event of default under the Notes or any other agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

As of September 30, 2021 after giving effect to the Transactions, the principal amount of our total financial liabilities would have been €465 million, which is represented mainly by the Notes. See “Capitalization.” As of the same date, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would also have had approximately €75 million available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility, after giving effect to any ancillary facilities. See “Description of Certain Financing and _Guarantee Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”_ We anticipate that our high leverage will continue and may increase for the foreseeable future due in part to expected investments in connection with our growth strategy. Our leverage could have important consequences to the holders of the Notes, including: (i) making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations with respect to the Notes and other debt liabilities; (ii) increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic and industry conditions; (iii) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow; (iv) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditures, business opportunities and other corporate requirements; (v) requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which means that this cash flow will not be available to fund our operations and for other corporate purposes; and (vi) limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and our industry. We may incur substantial additional debt in the future which could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering Memorandum. ----- If we cannot service our indebtedness and our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose.

This depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the interest on the Notes, our other debt service obligations, including under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The ability to refinance our debt may depend on stable loan or debt capital markets.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: reduce or delay our business activities, research and development and capital expenditures; sell assets; obtain additional debt or equity financing; or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

Such a default, or a failure to make interest payments on the Notes, could mean that borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of the Notes may in certain ----- circumstances require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes — Change of Control.” The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due. The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control event would result in an event of default under the Notes. If a change of control event were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay our outstanding indebtedness which we would be required to prepay or offer to purchase or that became immediately due and payable as a result. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions that will be in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict us from making such required repurchases. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements — Revolving _Credit Facility — Maturity and Repayment Requirements.” A change of control will be a mandatory_ prepayment event under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and a change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The change of control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as will be defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes — Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain a provision that requires us to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will be deemed not be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company; (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person; or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). There are few court precedents interpreting such and limited guidance has been provided so far by the courts on the specific features and extent of the undercapitalization requirement or the remedies that could be imposed for violations of the law. Some precedents have, however, held that these laws apply to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the Issuer and RdM. ----- Under these laws, a loan to a company made by a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (i.e., undercapitalization). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, there is a risk that Italian courts may determine that these laws are applicable to the Issuer’s relationship with RdM under the Proceeds Loan. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that an Italian court would conclude that RdM’s obligations under the Proceeds Loan are not subordinated to all of their obligations to other creditors. Should RdM’s obligations under the Proceeds Loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to their equity, prior to the Merger the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the Proceeds Loan, and this could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes or the Issuer’s ability to recover amounts owed to it pursuant to the Proceeds Loan. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests _and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans (including the Proceeds Loan) or notes are subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantee to be provided by RdM) may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of EBITDA (i.e., risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”), as well as 30% of ROL carried forward from previous fiscal years. The ROL is calculated on the basis of the value of the items of the Issuer’s profit and loss account, which are comprised of the operating gross revenues and expenses (excluding depreciation of tangible and intangible assets, as well as leasing fees), as determined through the application of the tax rules concerning the determination of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense in a fiscal year can be carried forward for the following five fiscal years. The amount of any interest income exceeding the interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward without time limits. Interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years and deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income (also carried forward from previous fiscal years) is lower than 30% of ROL. In the case of Italian tax resident companies participating in the same tax consolidated group, interest expenses not deducted by an entity at stand-alone level due to a lack of individual ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other companies in that tax consolidated group, in certain cases. Article 96 does not apply to certain entities active in the insurance and financial sector. In addition, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leverage buyout transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However, on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter n. 6/E (“Circular",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

In case an acquisition is considered as entered into by one or more entities that are related parties to the seller(s), the deduction of interest expenses may be challenged by the tax authorities based on anti-abuse provisions, depending on the existence of non marginal business reasons for the debt-financed acquisition. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than the ones of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing does not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic”and as such not compliant with the “inherence”principle set out under Italian tax law). Italian tax laws and pronouncements of the tax authorities are subject to change and positions that we take for tax purposes may be challenged. Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to make a refinancing under the “inherence” principle and/or to make an acquisition under the antiabuse provision, we may be unable to deduct our interest expenses and/or be subject to significant penalties or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including any future limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), (ii) the tax treatment of interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, (iii) the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense, or (iv) a change in the interpretation and application by Italian tax authorities of Italian tax law, may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of the realizable value for such assets. The fair market value of the Collateral as at the date of this Offering Memorandum may not exceed the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the Collateral, and in particular, the pledged capital stock could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, failure to implement our business strategy, competition and other future trends and may be without any value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. Value of the pledged stock, ability of suitable buyers and amount to be received upon sale of such Collateral could also be impaired in case non-pledged stock in the same entity is held by minority shareholders. In this respect it should also be noted that, in addition to uncertainty regarding the outcome of the MTO (and therefore the amount of shares of RdM to be pledged in favour of the Notes), RdM has currently saving shares in issue which are capable of being converted in ordinary shares representing 0.061% of its share capital. These saving shares of RdM (and any ordinary shares attributed to the relevant holders following a conversion) will in any case not form part of the Collateral until the moment they get acquired by the Issuer or any of its direct and/or indirect shareholder(s). Following the Merger, saving shares (or shares granting similar rights attributed in the Delisting or the relevant merger to the current owner of the saving shares) will be in place at the level of MergerCo and such saving shares (and any ordinary shares attributed to the relevant holders following a conversion) will in any case not form part of the Collateral until they get acquired by the Issuer or any of its direct and/or indirect shareholder(s).",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, secured creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, providers of certain additional super priority indebtedness, certain priority hedging obligations, if any, the Security Agent, any receiver and certain creditor representatives, including the Trustee, will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under super priority indebtedness are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will, after all obligations under super priority indebtedness have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes and certain non-priority hedging obligations, which obligations may be significant. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of other secured indebtedness of the Group. ----- The Intercreditor Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent shall act upon the instructions of the Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which will mean: (i) creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the indebtedness and commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain super priority hedging obligations and additional super priority indebtedness (the “Majority Super Senior",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

All or part of the pledges and other security interests in jurisdictions utilizing the Parallel Debt construct will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian and Dutch law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Notes Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Notes Collateral. Moreover, there are uncertainties as to the validity and enforceability of the German law governed Escrow Account Charge as a result of the Escrow Account Charge being granted to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes who will not become parties to the security agreement under which the Escrow Account Charge is constituted. As a matter of German law, to the extent accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheit) such as, for example, pledges over bank accounts is concerned, the relevant accessory security interest can only be granted to the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured. Against this background, the Escrow Account Charge will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Trustee mirroring the obligations of the Issuer towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Notes, and the Escrow Account Charge will be granted to the Trustee as security for the “parallel debt” and will not directly secure the principal obligations. As a result, holders of the Notes will bear some risk associated with a possible bankruptcy or insolvency of the Trustee. In addition, there are no published court decisions confirming the ----- validity of the parallel debt concept under German law and, to the extent successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes might not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the Escrow Account Charge. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of any Future Guarantees and the Notes _Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Furthermore, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, security can be created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) who are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c. as the Trustee of the holders of the Notes, since there is no established concept of “trust”or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Trustee as agent or trustee for holders of the Notes under security interests on Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. Further, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “Suspect Period”). In this regard, a longer period might apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the other security providers may, among other things, subject to the terms of the security documents, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral such as selling, modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the Collateral.

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under Italian law. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent is generally prevented from appropriating Italian Collateral save where certain conditions are met in respect of financial collateral. The Secuirty Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, due consideration should be given by investors to the circumstance that enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Italy may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The Indenture will not prohibit the Guarantors from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledges over the Guarantors’ shares may result in the release of the debt obligations of the Guarantors. Such release will be permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge.

See “Description of the Notes — Guarantees.” Accordingly, enforcement of the Guarantees against the Guarantors or enforcement of the Collateral against the relevant security grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the Guarantors, or in some cases, to limitations contained in the pledge or security designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant security grantor. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation or maintenance of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the Guarantors’ liability under its Guarantees or the liability of a pledgor of security could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the law applicable to it. ----- In particular, regarding any Italian guarantor, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, including following completion of the Merger pursuant to Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code,any Italian subsidiary of MergerCo: (i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions) advanced or made available from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Completion Date which are outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee or security interest and in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor; provided further that such Italian Guarantor shall not be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to (and permitted under the Indenture, Facility Agreement and Intercreditor Agreement to immediately) set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security interests granted by it; (ii) without prejudice to the limitation set out (i) above, the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by such Italian Guarantor at that time; (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of such Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, until the Merger is completed pursuant to Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the Guarantee and security interests granted by RdM, directly or indirectly, will be limited as follows: (i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by RdM will only guarantee and secure a portion of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes not exceeding the amount of Tranche A (as defined in “Use _of Proceeds”) under the Notes and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate_ principal amount of any intercompany loans (including the Proceeds Loan) (or other financial support in any form, not including equity contributions) advanced or made available from time to time to RdM (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, which are outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee or security interest and in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by RdM; provided further that RdM shall not be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that RdM is entitled to (and permitted under the Indenture, Facility Agreement and Intercreditor Agreement to ----- immediately) set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by RdM under the relevant Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security interests granted by it; (ii) without prejudice to the limitation set out in (i) above, the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by RdM, also in accordance with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the principal amount of the Tranche A (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche A (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by RdM will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by RdM at that time; (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of RdM under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively; and (v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee and/or security interest by RdM does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than a portion of the amounts and/or payment obligations under the Notes not exceeding the amount of Tranche A (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes. The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of RdM and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of RdM. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests granted by RdM be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to RdM will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force and effect. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than RdM) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility ----- Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. In addition to the above, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security. See “Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ Further, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of Italian financial assistance and corporate benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances you would have no direct claim for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral. It is possible that a guarantor or a pledgor of security, or a creditor of a pledgor of security, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a pledgor of security, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees or the pledgor’s pledge of security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the pledge should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations on the security obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable guarantor or pledgor, including trade payables of such pledgor to the extent of such limitations. Future guarantees or pledges may be subject to similar limitations. Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the ----- Issuer or certain of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims under the Notes and the Guarantees may be released or transferred. Your ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances. See “Description of the _Notes — Security; the Collateral,” “Description of_ _Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement.” The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Collateral securing the_ Notes may be released and retaken in connection with the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness, if it is not possible to implement any such transaction by instead granting additional Collateral and amending the terms of the existing Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, including Italy, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to release in connection with a distressed disposal. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor _Agreement — Distressed Disposal” and “Description of the Notes — Security; the Collateral.”_ Additionally, even though the holders of Notes will share in the Collateral with the secured parties under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the secured parties under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging agreements will receive the proceeds of the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes and, under certain circumstances, the secured parties under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not the holders of the Notes agree with those actions.

In addition, the granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening periods. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. In each instance, if the security interest granted, perfected or re-created were to be enforced before the end of the relevant hardening period applicable in Italy, such security interest may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the _Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Additionally, if our shareholder decides to affect the Permitted Parent Reorganization as described under “Description of the Notes — Certain Definitions — Permitted Parent Reorganization,” there can be no assurances that this will not create new hardening periods for the Guarantors’ share pledges. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective applicable hardening period, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

In the event that the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the insolvency and other laws of Italy may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights against the Collateral in Italy and limit any amounts that you may receive.

The measures of insolvency for the purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if at the time it incurred the debt: ----- - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be sure as to what standard a court would apply in making a solvency determination or that a court would conclude that the Issuer was solvent immediately after the Offering. Regardless of the standard that the court uses, we cannot be sure that the Offering (or grant of the Collateral) would not be voided or subordinated to our other debt. Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors organized under the laws of Italy (or any future Italian guarantor of the Notes) enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to secure the Notes (and any guarantees thereof, if applicable) could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a Suspect Period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a Suspect Period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action during the Suspect Period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the Suspect Period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy receiver must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any clawback action. See “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective _vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In_ addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. If challenged successfully, the Guarantees and security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of the Guarantees or any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the Guarantees and/or the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations.","The Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates of interest equal to the applicable three-month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) for the relevant interest period plus a margin adjusted at regular intervals. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. As of and from the Step-Up Date this interest rate will increase by 0.500%, 1.000% or 1.500% (the effect of which corresponds to an annualized step-up in interest rates of 0.250%, 0.500% and 0.750%, respectively, for the four quarters prior to maturity) depending on whether respectively, one, two or three Sustainability Performance Targets are not achieved, unless the Issuer has achieved the Sustainability Performance Targets by December 31, 2025, as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) on or prior to the Certification Date. See “Description of the Notes — Calculation of Interest.” Moreover, for the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, a floor of 0% applies to the calculation of EURIBOR. Accordingly, should the relevant EURIBOR remain below 0%, we would not be able to benefit from such decrease. The Indenture will not contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. We may, however, elect to enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix these rates, although there can be no assurance that we will enter into hedging or that hedging will be available on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, hedging carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay significant amounts (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks”are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on March 5, 2021, the FCA formally confirmed its intention to cease publishing 24 LIBOR settings, including all seven euro LIBOR settings after December 31, 2021, and the overnight and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR setting after June 30, 2023. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or potential elimination of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes whose interest rates are linked to EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The Intercreditor Agreement will further provide that in the event that the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not consented to the relevant enforcement instructions or if conflicting enforcement instructions are received from any creditor representative prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the creditor representatives must consult with each other in good faith for a period of 15 days to agree on joint enforcement instructions. Although enforcement instructions given by holders of the Notes and certain other creditors may prevail after such 15-day consultation period, under certain circumstances, enforcement instructions by the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility and certain other creditors will prevail. If the creditor representatives are not able to agree on joint enforcement instructions by the end of the consultation period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the enforcement instructions (if any) given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, provided that if: (i) the super senior creditors (comprised of the creditors in respect of our Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to certain of our super priority hedging arrangements and other holders of additional super priority indebtedness) have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the consultation period; (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three months of the end of the consultation period; or (iii) the Issuer or certain of its subsidiaries becomes subject to insolvency or similar proceedings and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action at that time, then the instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent that we incur further indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes, your voting interest in the Majority Senior Secured Creditors will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. As these other creditors and counterparties may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and may elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the Collateral at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so, these arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Collateral in a manner that results in lower recoveries by holders of the Notes. Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released.

As of the day of the launch of the MTO, the Issuer has stated its intention to exercise its right in the Squeeze Out Procedure, in order to acquire any RdM shares not previously tendered, should the relevant threshold be reached and the Squeeze Out Procedure be Triggered.

As such, the Merger could qualify, if applicable, as a “merger following an acquisition funded by financial indebtedness” with consequent applicability of Art. 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code by reason of the amounts disbursed in favor of the Issuer pursuant to the Bidco Facility Agreement or amounts outstanding under the Notes (as applicable depending on when such Merger is undertaken), in the case of a Merger between RdM and the Issuer.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,16,SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION,16.23,"Consolidated Financial Information”). It should be noted that, as previously indicated, the Issuer was",16.23.2,,"incorporated on June 21, 2021; and therefore, the pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 is based on the historical consolidated financial information of RdM Group. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared on a voluntary basis for inclusion in the Offering Memorandum being prepared in connection with the Issuer’s proposed issuance of the Notes. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared to illustrate the pro forma effects of the following (hereinafter the “Operations”) on the Group’s historical financial position and results of operations as of and for each of the periods described below (as applicable): - the Share Acquisitions assuming, for the purposes of preparing this Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, that 100% of RdM was acquired by the Issuer; - the Eska Acquisition (completed on July 13, 2021) and the La Rochette Disposal (completed in April 2021) as if each of these transactions had occurred on January 1, 2020; and - the completion of the Refinancing. For the purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position presented herein, we gave effect to the Operations as if they had occurred on September 30, 2021. For the purpose of preparing the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements presented herein we gave effect to the Operations as if they had occurred on January 1, 2020. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not give effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, which was completed on July 1, 2021. See “Business — Our History.” The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not purport to represent what our actual results of operations would have been if the Operations had actually occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial condition. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and based upon available information and certain estimates and assumptions that each of the Issuer and RdM believe are reasonable. The acquisition of RdM by way of the Share Acquisitions will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires determination of the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the date of the Private Acquisition and allocation of the purchase price based on such fair value determinations. We have not yet performed the valuation analyses required to estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Share Acquisitions. Accordingly, the excess of the purchase price over the historical book value of identifiable assets acquired in connection with these acquisitions has been allocated to goodwill in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as described further in Note 3(b) below. Ultimately, a portion of the purchase price paid as part of the Share Acquisitions, which may be significant, will be allocated to depreciable assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, and this could materially increase our depreciation and amortization expense. The Share Acquisitions and the Refinancing are described in detail under “Summary — Transactions”, the Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal are described in detail under “Business — Our History.” As mentioned above, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information represents a simulation, for illustrative purposes only, of certain potential impacts of the Operations. In particular, as pro forma information is prepared to illustrate retrospectively the effects of transactions that occur subsequent to the end of the financial periods presented there are limitations that are inherent to the nature of pro forma information; hence, had the Operations taken place on the dates assumed above, the actual effects would not necessarily have been the same as those presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. In addition, certain of the Operations have not yet occurred, and the impact of the Operations has been estimated based on estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at this time. The unaudited pro forma financial data was not prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any other set of ----- generally accepted accounting standards. Furthermore, in consideration of the different purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information as compared to the historical financial statements and the different methods of calculation of the effects of the Operations on the pro forma consolidated statement of financial position and on the pro forma consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the latter two statements should be read and interpreted without comparison between them. The RdM and Eska financial information used to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been extracted from, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information should be read together with: - the consolidated financial statements of RdM Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (hereinafter the “RdM Group 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) prepared in accordance with IFRS, approved by the Board of Directors on March 19, 2021 and audited by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. which issued its unqualified audit report on April 7, 2021; - the RdM Group Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements approved by the Board of Directors on November 8, 2021; and - the Eska Group Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements approved by sole director of Fineska on November 11, 2021; It should be noted that the Issuer has not yet prepared any annual or interim financial statements and information presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information for the Issuer has been extracted from its accounting records at the relevant dates. The pro forma adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information are limited to those that are (i) directly attributable to the pro forma adjustment related to the Operations and (ii) factually supportable. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not reflect, for example: - any integration costs that may be incurred as a result of the Operations; - any synergies, operating efficiencies and cost savings that may result from the Operations; or - any costs that may be incurred as a result of the Operations and to which executive officers could become entitled to in the future. In addition, please refer to “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Transactions,” “Risk Factors — Risks _Related to Our Structure,” “The Transactions,” “Capitalization,” “Use of Proceeds,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for important information about_ the RdM Group, the Issuer, the Transactions and the Operations that should be read and considered when evaluating the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information that follows below. It should be noted that the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not necessarily reflect transactions that have occurred after the balance sheet date as of September 30, 2021, if they will be superseded subsequently either by the completion of the Share Acquisitions assuming that 100% of RdM will be acquired by the Issuer or the completion of the Refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The acquisition of the RdM Group by way of the Share Acquisitions is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, which provides that at the time of an acquisition the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets acquired, the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value at acquisition date, except for deferred tax assets and liabilities for employee benefits and assets held for sale, which are recognized on the basis of the related accounting principles. The difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, if positive, is recognized in intangible assets as goodwill, or, if negative, after reviewing the fair value measurements of the assets and liabilities acquired, is recognized directly in the income statement, as income. Transaction costs are recorded in the income statement when incurred. We have not yet performed the analyses necessary to calculate the fair values of RdM Group’s assets and liabilities, so goodwill has been determined on a provisional basis as the difference between the purchase consideration of the Share Acquisitions and the book value of the RdM Group’s net assets as of September 30, 2021, which is the latest financial information available at the date of preparing the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Preliminary Financial Information. As the Issuer has not completed its purchase price allocation for the acquisition of the RdM Group and the final allocation may differ materially from the preliminary allocation. The final valuation and the impact of integration activities could cause material differences between actual and pro forma results. In particular, allocations of the purchase price to fixed depreciable assets or intangible assets with a finite useful life could materially increase our depreciation and amortization expenses. As the Issuer completes the purchase price allocation for the RdM Group, the preliminary allocation is subject to change. (a) Reflects the pro forma purchase consideration calculated based on 377.8 million of issued ordinary shares of RdM as of September 30, 2021, net of 2.1 million of treasury shares at the same date, multiplied by the offering price of €1.45 per share. No acceleration of share-based compensation to certain members of RdM management has been assumed and consequently the purchase consideration does not reflect the accelerated vesting of any such share-based compensation. However, the Issuer expects that an equivalent amount may be allocated in the future to management for stock grants issued and outstanding but not yet vested at the offering price of €1.45 per share. As no binding agreement has yet been formalized at the time of the preparation of the pro forma financial information, this potential future cash outflow is only considered for the preparation of the table on sources and uses (See “ The Transactions” ).

Our identity is built on a clear vision centered on the circular economy that guides our activities as a manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, and that represents a balanced combination between our business and the expectations of our stakeholders; see also “Business — Our Production Process — Circular Business Model.” Our ambition is to be the partner of choice of all key stakeholders with three strategic goals in mind: to offer excellent products and services, to optimize costs and to maximize the satisfaction of our customers, all while helping drive increased sustainability within the paper and packaging industry. We serve our customers through a network of nine mills, five sheeting and distribution centres, and ten sales offices. As of December 31, 2020, we employed over 1,990 employees (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We believe that our geographical footprint across Europe and exposure to resilient end-markets (such as the food end-market) are key strengths of our business, which we have reinforced through the recent Eska Acquisition and Paprinsa Acquisition. Our position as a leader in the European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills, our “multi-mill” concept, whereby we seek to be able to offer the same cartonboard products at different mills, helping us provide highly localized delivery quickly and better meet our customers’ demands. Our distributed mill network is integrated by our “One Company” operating model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent. ----- - WLC. In our WLC market segment, we produce cartonboard from recycled fibers for folding carton and corrugated packaging applications. We are the second largest WLC producer (based on annual production capacity as of December 31, 2020), with a market share of approximately 25% for 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition), in a highly fragmented European market. We are also the largest WLC producer based on our annual production capacity as of December 31, 2020, in Italy, France and Spain. In terms of production capacity, WLC represents approximately 76% of our business as of December 31, 2020 (giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We had a total WLC production capacity of 1,166 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition). - SB. In our SB market segment, we produce solidboard from recycled fibers for packaging and graphical applications. We had a total production capacity of 359 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition). In terms of production capacity, SB represents approximately 24% of our business as of December 31, 2020 (giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We are a leading solidboard producer with a global reach. Following the Eska Acquisition, we now have two industryleading solidboard production facilities (in terms of production capacity) in The Netherlands with the largest SB production capacity among participants in the core market segments in which Eska operates (which include luxury packaging, bookbinding, puzzles and games) for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal as if they had occurred on October 1, 2020), we generated adjusted pro forma consolidated revenues from sales of €853.9 million, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of €119.2 million and an Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA Margin of 14.0%, and we had Adjusted Pro Forma tons sold of 1,451 tons.

The global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in governments and organizations around the world mandating restrictive measures to contain the spread of the virus, including quarantine and social distancing measures, travel restrictions and suspension of non-essential business activities. These and other measures have been implemented to various degrees and at various times since the start of the pandemic. COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to the global economy and has impacted all of the countries in which the RdM Group operates. At the start of the pandemic we quickly introduced comprehensive precautionary measures to limit the risk of infection and protect our employees, suppliers and customers. These measures included, for example, acquiring additional health and safety devices to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection and costs associated with additional sanitization activities. The total costs of such measures was €0.6 million in 2020. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased total volumes shipped (based on the number of tonnes shipped) in 2020 compared to 2019 by 0.8%, driven by an 8.3% increase for FBB while WLC remained substantially consistent as it was impacted by the temporary production shutdown of the Villa Santa Lucia and Ovaro mills. Specifically, the increase in volumes was driven by the RdM Group’s production of materials required to package and distribute essential goods such as food and pharmaceutical products. In relation to the luxury packaging sector, in which our Ovaro paper mill operates, the RdM Group made a strong recovery in the second half of 2020 driven by sales to markets in Asia following a slower start in the beginning of the year that we believe was due, in part, to the effect COVID-19 had on the market for luxury goods. As noted above, in 2020 the RdM Group was able to increase production and shipment levels and all of the RdM Group’s paper mills operated at substantially full capacity, consistent with prior years. With the exception of the Villa Santa Lucia and Ovaro mills, which were negatively impacted by temporary production shutdowns as noted above, production at all of our other mills was broadly consistent with or higher in 2020 compared to 2019. The second quarter of 2020 was characterized by a sharp increase in demand linked to the increase in stocks by customers to mitigate possible interruptions in production caused by the pandemic, with an opposite effect in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2020, volumes shipped increased marginally compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. In the first nine months of 2021 global demand has increased as certain COVID-19-related restrictions have eased to varying degrees in certain parts of the world and we have increased our volumes shipped compared to the same period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had any significant negative effects on our operations or financial position in the first nine months of September 30, 2021. Many uncertainties remain regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including its ultimate duration, and the extent of local and worldwide social, political, and economic disruption it may cause. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our overall business, operations, or financial results to date, it may have far-reaching impacts on many aspects of our operations, including impacts on customer and consumer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, inventory, accounts receivable, our employees, and the market generally. We will continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and intend to make adjustments to our business accordingly.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Increasing Sustainability Trends,17.4.2,The pass through of price fluctuations of raw materials and energy (mainly gas) into the sales prices for our products,"Our results of operations are influenced by fluctuations in the price of our raw materials and energy consumption, increases in prices of which we attempt to pass on to our customers. Raw materials prices in particular drive changes in the sales prices for our products. ----- The cost of raw materials and services represented 80.9%, 71.3%, 76.0% and 75.8% of our revenues from sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with raw materials and, to a lesser extent, energy (mainly gas and electricity), being the most significant components. In particular, the cost of raw materials represented 57.4%, 56.1%, 56.7% and 60.8%, and energy costs represented 18.0%, 17.2%, 18.5% and 15.3%, of our total cost of raw materials and services for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The prices of raw materials and energy may fluctuate due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity and commodity market fluctuations, as well as changes in governmental policies and regulations. Purchases of most of our raw materials are based on negotiated rates with suppliers, which are tied to published indices. Historically, we have not entered into long-term purchase contracts that provide for fixed quantities or prices for our principal raw materials. In Italy, we are a member of the National Consortium for the Recovery and Recycling of Cellulose-based Packaging (Comieco) and such membership grants us certain guaranteed supply quantities of fibers at a fair market price. Changes in raw material prices impact our results of operations. While we generally do not have clauses for the pass-through of input costs predefined in our sales contracts, we are generally able to pass through increases in these costs through the regular renegotiation of contracts with our customers. Conversely, our customers generally expect price reductions when our input costs decrease. Generally, the price adjustments do not occur simultaneously with commodity price fluctuations. Due to differences in timing between purchases of raw materials and sales to customers, there is often a lead-lag effect, during which margins are negatively impacted in the short term when raw material costs increase and positively impacted in the short term when raw material costs decrease. Historically, the average lag time in implementing raw material cost pass-through mechanisms has been approximately two or three months depending on the size of the order backlog at a given point in time. On an annual or longer-term basis, our sales prices are directly correlated to our main raw material costs, although divergences may occur between our raw materials costs and sales prices over interim periods, thereby impacting our margins. Changes in energy prices are not as easily passed through to our sales prices, unless they are significant, and therefore fluctuations in energy prices may cause short term margin fluctuations. In order to reduce the volatility of our costs for gas consumption, which represents our main energy cost, we generally purchase approximately 30% of our gas volumes using fixed price contracts for a period of up to three years, approximately 30% of our gas volumes using fixed price contracts for a period of up to twelve months, and approximately 40% of our gas volumes at spot rates or with short term hedging. Arrangements may differ by country. For example, for our Barcelona power plant we have historically entered into a special hedging contract to simultaneously fix the prices of gas purchased and power sold to the grid for approximately 60% of volumes. We hedge the price of approximately 20% of the coal used at our Arnsberg power plant using 3-year fixed price contracts. For the purchase of electricity, we generally enter into short-term hedging transactions based on available market opportunities. The prices for some of our raw materials, particularly fibers, have fluctuated in recent years. Waste paper is typically purchased from sources close to our mills and, as a result, prices are established locally based on factors such as demand levels and local competitive conditions. The price of waste paper is also affected by demand levels in other industries; particularly containerboard where recent demand has been strong, and future demand is expected to remain strong, driven by the significant growth in e-commerce. We primarily purchase recycled fibers, paper for recycling (“PfR”), used to make pulp and produce board, but also market pulp-chemicals. Brown grade materials make up the majority of our purchases, followed to a lesser extent by white grades and market pulp. The average cost per ton of recycled fibers decreased during the period from 2018 to 2020 although prices have increased significantly in the first nine months of 2021. For example, the average cost per ton of old corrugated cardboard decreased from €144 per ton in 2017 to €96 per ton in 2018, €76 per ton in 2019 and to €65 per ton in 2020 related to China’s ban on waste importing, and then increasing significantly to €153 per ton in the first nine months of 2021, primarily in the first six months of the year. The decrease in the average cost of recycled fibers from 2018 to 2020 resulted in an overall decrease in our average sales prices over the same period, however we have been successful in decreasing our sales prices proportionally less than the decrease in cost of recycled fibers, thereby helping to increase our contribution margin, alongside operational efficiency implementation. We also increased our revenues from sales by 12.1% ----- from 2018 to 2020 as a result of increasing sales volumes driven by production efficiencies and acquisitions. Conversely, the significant increase in the cost of recycled fibers and other materials in the first nine months of 2021 has resulted in an increase in our average sales prices, with a direct effect on our revenues from sales. Furthermore, given the rate and magnitude of the increase in costs thus far in 2021, we have started implementing contractual price-adjustment mechanisms with customers to ensure timely and adequate modifications to our selling prices, including for our order book. We use various strategies to manage cost exposures on certain raw material purchases with the objective of obtaining more predictable costs for these commodities. From time to time we enter into hedging agreements for some of our raw materials and energy sources to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. Although we continue to take steps to minimize the impact of the volatility of raw material prices through commodity hedging, fixed supplier pricing, reducing the lag time in contractual raw material cost pass-through mechanisms and entering into additional indexed customer contracts that include raw material cost pass-through provisions, we expect our results of operations to continue to be impacted by price fluctuations of raw materials and energy (mainly gas) costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Increasing Sustainability Trends,17.4.3,Macroeconomic environment and market trends,"We mainly operate in the WLC market, represented by paperboard coated packaging products using recycled materials. Sales of WLC products represented approximately 83%, 84% and 81% of our revenues from sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Global demand for this market in 2020 was substantially in line with 2019, despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, in European markets in 2020, compared to 2019, global demand based on volumes rose in France (+5.8%), Northern Europe (+3.1%), Germany (+2.3%) and other minor markets, while declining in Spain (-7.1%) and in Italy (-5.1%). In 2020 overseas markets posted a considerable decrease (-9.1%) compared to 2019, including the effects of a decrease in insurance coverage of customers linked to the higher risk of many countries. We posted marginal growth in line with the market (+0.2%) in 2020, despite the stop of the production to the paper mill in Villa Santa Lucia, from February 7 to March 1, 2020 as a result of the seizure of the water purifier belonging to the Cosilam consortium by the competent judicial authorities for reasons not attributable in any way to the paper mill. The effect of the lack of production was partially mitigated in terms of volumes shipped by the use of stocks of finished products and by the relocation of orders to other paper mills of the RdM Group. The Ovaro paper mill recorded a decrease in demand in the first half of 2020, with the consequent need to program shutdowns, driven by lower exposure toward strategic sectors, since the Ovaro paper mill operates for the most part in sectors such as luxury or school products, which have substantially stopped the production during the most acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. The decrease in volumes was in any case contained and substantially recovered in the second half of 2020 as a result of the resumption of production activities in all sectors in which Ovaro operates. Despite these challenging conditions, we recorded higher volumes in 2020 compared to the market trends in the main reference markets: Italy (+0.8%), Spain (-4.8%) and France (+6.7%). Prior to the disposal of the operations of La Rochette in April 2021, the RdM Group also operated in the Folding Box Board (FBB) market, represented by cartonboard for folding boxboard using virgin fibers. Overall demand in the FBB market increased by 5% in 2020 compared to 2019, while the RdM Group increased FBB sales by 8.3% over the same period. The increase of the market was mainly attributable to the essential nature of the products and a partial recovery in demand following a decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality and price. While we have long-term relationships with many of our customers, the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time, and we may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all, as pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship. The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have an impact on, and as such, affect, our operating results. We believe our market leadership, being the second-largest provider of WLC in Europe and the largest provider in Italy, France, and Spain, is predicated on our strong service and quality and we expect to maintain strong relationships with our customer base. ----- In addition, our sales are driven by consumer buying habits, and recently we have seen net organic sales growth driven by the consumers’ desire for sustainable packaging solutions and increased at home consumption. Changes in consumer dietary habits and preferences, increases in the costs of living, unemployment rates, access to credit markets, as well as other macroeconomic factors, may negatively affect consumer spending behavior.

We believe we can leverage our existing industry and operational expertise to identify such acquisition opportunities and enhance profitability of the acquired business. Our most recent transactions are: - 2018: acquisition of 100% of Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U., which has allowed us to strengthen our leadership in Southern Europe, consolidate our position as a leading European producer of paperboard using recycled materials, and optimize our product portfolio and customer service due to the proximity of the Barcelona facility to some of the biggest European converters. - 2021: (i) Eska Acquisition, expanding our capabilities in the SB sector, (ii) the Paprinsa Acquisition, enhancing our leadership position and capabilities in the European coated chipboard sector; and (iii) the La Rochette Disposal implementing our strategic decision to leave the FBB segment. Although they are not fully reflected in our results, based on the performance of Eska, Paprinsa and La Rochette over the period under review, we anticipate that the cumulative effect of our acquisitions and disposals over the course of 2021 may have a significant impact on future results. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, Eska generated EBITDA of €17.7 million, €22.8 million and €26.2 million, respectively, and Eska generated €19.4 million in EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. (*) Eska sold 272 thousand tons at an average price of €625 per ton in 2018, 247 thousand tons at an average price of €660 per ton in 2019, 241 thousand tons at an average price of €610 per ton in 2020. Eska’s maintenance capital expenditures were approximately €4 million in each of 2018 and 2019 and were approximately €5 million in 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, Paprinsa generated EBITDA of €0.8 million, €3.1 million and €6.0 million, respectively, and Paprinsa generated €(0.2) million in EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Paprinsa’s maintenance capital expenditures were approximately €3 million in 2018, €4 million in 2019 and €2 million in 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, La Rochette generated EBITDA of €0.3 million, €(5.8) million and €(10.3) million, respectively, and La Rochette generated €(2.4) million in EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. La Rochette sold 142 thousand tons at an average price of €818 per ton in 2018, 133 thousand tons at an average price of €844 per ton in 2019, 144 thousand tons at an average price of €806 per ton in 2020. If we exclude the net sales and raw materials and other costs of La Rochette, our contribution margin would have been €188 million in 2018, €214 million in 2019 and €222 million in 2020. Given our global scale and existing operating structure, we are frequently able to identify synergies to remove a significant amount of the existing cost base of an acquired business, which allows us to improve the profitability of the acquired business in a relatively short time. In addition, we seek to identify commercial synergies between acquired business and the RdM Group, leveraging our existing customer base, expertise and relationships. See the section entitled “Our Business — Our History” below for additional information relating to our recent acquisitions and disposals. Although we believe our approach to acquisitions has helped to grow our business during the period under review, acquisitions involve certain risks.

Specifically, we have taken the following actions since 2018: - the optimization of raw materials used in the production of cartonboard, primarily in 2019, resulting in lower average costs for materials; - initiatives to reduce energy consumption, primarily in 2019, which in addition to reducing energy costs has allowed the RdM Group to increase income from the sale of White Certificates, which amounted to €5.2 million, €4.9 million and €0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. One example of this is turning off one of the boilers at our Arnsberg mill that was producing excess energy and purchasing from the market as required. - investments made to improve production efficiencies and reduce waste, primarily through maintenance activities and supply chain optimization; - the purchase of a new boiler house at our Ovaro mill; and - the implementation of a new ERP system for the Ovaro mill which went live in November 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Increasing Sustainability Trends,17.4.7,,"Interest in sustainability has increased over the past decade and accelerated in recent years, and we expect that sustainability trends will play an increasing role in customer and consumer purchasing decisions. There have been recent concerns about the environmental impact of single-use products and products made from plastic. Governmental authorities continue to implement legislation aimed at reducing the amount of plastic and other wastes incapable of being reused, recycled or composted. Such legislation, as well as voluntary initiatives similarly aimed at reducing the level of single-use plastic packaging waste, could increase demand for certain of our products. Some companies have responded to these governmental initiatives and to perceived sustainability concerns of consumers by shifting toward more recyclable and sustainable products. This trend is aligned with our core business and with our innovation efforts around sustainability. Across our business, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from growth in fiber-based, recyclable packaging, as we already positively and directly contribute to the circular economy of recycled fibers. ----- We intend to continue our innovation and product development efforts to ensure that we are at the leading edge of recyclability in order to offer our customers increasingly sustainable choices. Substantially all of our revenues from sales were derived from products made with recycled, recyclable and renewable materials for the periods presented. We expect to incur additional capital expenditures and research and development costs as a result of developing products for new applications, while strictly maintaining the essential feature of recyclability of our existing more sustainable products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

We completed the Eska Acquisition on July 13, 2021 and we started to consolidate the Eska Group from that date. Therefore, our results of operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 include approximately three months of performance from the Eska Group while our results of operations in 2020, 2019 and 2018 do not include the performance from Eska Group. The contribution to our EBITDA of the Eska Group was €4.8 million in 2021 from the date of the Eska Acquisition. We completed the Paprinsa Acquisition on July 1, 2021 and we started to consolidate the Paprinsa Group from that date. Therefore, our results of operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 include three months of performance from the Paprinsa Group while our results of operations in 2020, 2019 and 2018 do not include the performance from the Paprinsa Group. The contribution to our EBITDA of the Paprinsa Group was €1.2 million in 2021 from the date of the Paprinsa Acquisition. We completed the La Rochette Disposal in April 2021, following which we no longer consolidated La Rochette. We recognized an impairment loss of €3.7 million in 2020 as we remeasured the carrying amount of the La Rochette cash generating unit in line with its recoverable amount. An additional loss from disposal of €1.7 million was recognized in 2021. La Rochette is presented as a discontinued operation in the RdM Group Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum. We completed the acquisition of Barcelona Cartonboard on October 31, 2018 and we started to consolidate Barcelona Cartonboard from that date. Therefore, our results of operations in 2018 include two months of performance from Barcelona Cartonboard compared to a full year in 2019 and 2020, and a full nine months 2021. The contribution to our EBITDA of Barcelona Cartonboard was €1.5 million for the two months in which it was consolidated by the RdM Group in 2018 and €8.2 million for the full year 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

We applied the simplified transition approach and therefore recognized the impacts of adoption at January 1, 2019 without restating comparative figures for the period prior to adoption. As a result, EBITDA increased by €3.4 million in 2019 due to the recognition of right-of-use assets that would have previously been recognized as lease expenses within cost of raw materials and services, and depreciation charges and financial expenses were €3.3 million and €0.5 million higher, respectively, due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Additionally, adjusted net financial debt as of December 31, 2019 was €12.5 million higher as a result of recognizing lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The increase was primarily attributable to (i) the increase in the price for recycled fibers, other materials used in production and energy in 2021 and (ii) the change in the consolidation perimeter and consequent increase of cost of raw materials and services amounting to €59.1 million due to the effects of the Eska Acquisition and the Paprinsa Acquisition, which were both completed in July 2021.

The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in selling prices, mainly in the WLC segment, mainly due to the passthrough to customers of a decrease in raw material prices, as well as to the temporary stoppage of production at the Villa Santa Lucia plant for several weeks in February 2020 following the seizure of the municipal consortium’s wastewater treatment plant and to a decrease in demand for specialties products which impacted production at the Ovaro plant. Despite the decrease in selling prices, we sold 1,184 thousand total tons sold in 2020 compared to 1,174 thousand total tons sold in 2019. Revenues from sales of the WLC segment decreased by €27.0 million, or 4.6%, to €564.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €591.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to the abovementioned reduction of selling prices in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by the passthrough of raw materials prices. Revenues from sales of the FBB segment increased by €4.9 million, or 4.4%, to €115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for FBB (+€9.6 million) products, partially offset by a decrease in selling prices in 2020 compared to 2019 (-€4.6 million), driven by the passthrough of raw material prices. ----- By geographical area, revenues from sales in Italy in 2020 were substantially in line with 2019, with an increase in the FBB segment that was substantially offset by a decrease in the WLC segment. The decrease in revenues from sales for the same period in the European Union of €14.5 million was primarily attributable to WLC sales in Iberia driven by COVID-19 and in the UK due to the effects of Brexit, partially offset by WLC sales for the same period in France and an increase in the FBB segment driven by sales in Germany, Spain and France. The decrease in revenues from sales of €6.4 million in the rest of the world was driven by WLC sales, primarily in Turkey and overseas markets. _2019 vs 2018_ Revenues from sales increased by €95.6 million, or 15.8%, to €701.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €606.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Barcelona Cartonboard in November 2018, which contributed to revenues of €21.9 million in November and December 2018 compared to a full year of revenues of €132.8 million in 2019. Revenues from sales of the WLC segment increased by €99.7 million, or 20.3%, to €591.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €491.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the abovementioned acquisition of Barcelona Cartonboard, partially offset by a decrease in selling prices in 2019 compared to 2018, particularly in the second half of 2019, driven by the passthrough of raw material prices and resulting in a negative impact of €11.2 million. Excluding the acquisition of Barcelona Cartonboard, volumes impact was positive €2.5 million. Revenues from sales of the FBB segment decreased by €4.1 million, or 3.6%, to €110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the volumes for the FBB products driven by market conditions. By geographical area, revenues from sales in Italy increased by €3.1 million or 1.5%, while the increase of €68.0 million, or 20.4% in the European Union was primarily attributable to the abovementioned acquisition of Barcelona Cartonboard. Revenues from sales in the rest of world increased by €24.5 million or 33.7%. _Other revenues and income 2020 vs 2019_ Other revenues increased by €2.1 million, or 19.8%, to €12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to (i) an increase in grants of €1.2 million to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and (ii) an increase in energy revenues of €1.0 million to €7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Grants during the periods presented mainly relate to incentives for manufacturing companies with high energy consumption and the increase in 2020 primarily relates to amounts received by R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S., R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH and Barcelona Cartonboard. The increase in energy revenues was driven by compensation received from certain energy suppliers based on contractual arrangements under which we accept a certain level of interruption of energy services, as well as the sale of electricity and from energy efficiency certificates (white certificates) assigned to Italian mills during 2020. _2019 vs 2018_ Other revenues increased by €4.3 million, or 68.3%, to €10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in energy efficiency certificates (also known as White Certificates) granted to our plants in Italy. ----- _Cost of raw materials and services_ The following table provides a breakdown of the cost of raw materials and services for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the prices of raw materials and energy used as production inputs. The cost of raw materials and services amounted to 71.3% of revenues from sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the abovementioned decrease in the price of raw materials and energy. ----- The cost of raw materials refers mainly to the purchase of products used to make pulp (waste paper, wood paste, cellulose and chemicals) and for packaging. This item recorded a decrease of €30.8 million, primarily due to the reduction in the average cost of both recycled and virgin fibers. Regarding the main factors of production, the price of scrap paper, after strong price decreases in the previous two years, made a further decrease at the beginning of 2020. This decrease reversed starting from mid-March 2020 as a result of a decrease in supply resulting from lower city collections as a result of the COVID-19 emergency. A new downward trend was, however, recorded starting in July 2020. It was not until the last quarter of 2020 that a new increase in prices occurred, supported by an increased demand coming primarily from the containerboard sector. On the other hand, the price of virgin cellulosic fibers, after peaking in fiscal 2018 and then falling sharply in 2019, has been stable. Costs for services show a decrease of €18.4 million primarily due to the reduction in the purchase prices of the RdM Group’s main energy supply sources, namely natural gas, electricity and coal, a reduction that had already begun in 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2020 the positive effect resulting from price dynamics was mitigated by medium-term purchase agreements concluded by the RdM Group. Costs for use of third-party assets as of December 31, 2020 amount to €1.9 million, in line with the ones from the previous year. _2019 vs 2018_ Cost of raw materials and services increased by €74.0 million, or 16.1%, to €533.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €459.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due an increase in raw materials and industrial services, also in connection with the Barcelona Cartonboard Acquisition and consolidation starting from October 31, 2018, compared to a full year consolidation in 2019. Raw materials and services amounted to 76.0% of revenues from sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 75.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Particularly, cost of raw materials increased by €23.6 million to €302.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €279.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is due to the Barcelona Cartonboard Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in price of recycled fibers and virgin cellulose in 2019 compared to 2018. Service costs increased by €52.4 million. This increase was mostly due to the different scope of consolidation due to the Barcelona Cartonboard Acquisition, which resulted in an increase in costs of €49.5 million as well as, to increased costs for waste disposal related to the increase in prices. With regard to energy costs, the prices of natural gas and coal, the main energy sources of the RdM Group, decreased significantly in 2019 compared to 2018. The positive effect resulting from price dynamics was mitigated by medium-term purchase agreements initiated in 2018. Costs for use of third-party assets at December 31, 2019 fell compared with the previous year, standing at €1.6 million. This reduction was exclusively due to the introduction, from January 1, 2019, of IFRS 16 according to which costs for rentals and leases should be capitalized and recorded in the income statement based on the depreciation method. _Personnel costs 2020 vs 2019_ Personnel costs increased by €3.9 million, or 3.7%, to €108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to contractual increases and productivity bonus payments, as well as to long-term incentives granted to senior management. _2019 vs 2018_ Personnel costs increased by €13.3 million, or 14.6%, to €104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to the full consolidation of RdM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U starting from November 2018. ----- _Net financial income (expense) 2020 vs 2019_ Net financial expense decreased by €4.2 million, or 77.8%, to €1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is essentially due to the financial income recorded following the valuation at December 31, 2020 of the derivatives subscribed by Barcelona Cartonboard to hedge its purchases of gas and electricity. _2019 vs 2018_ Net financial expense increased by €3.0 million, to €5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to a different scope of consolidation, and particularly the Barcelona Cartonboard Acquisition (+€2.4 million) and the financial expense recognized following the adoption of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which changed the accounting treatment of operating leases (€0.5 million). _Taxes 2020 vs 2019_ Taxes increased by €2.8 million to €12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly attributable to higher taxable income generated by the RdM Group’s companies that have tax loss carryforwards to offset current period taxable income. _2019 vs 2018_ Taxes decreased by €3.3 million to €9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributable to a decrease in profit before tax. _EBITDA_ The table below sets forth EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes driven by production and operational efficiencies and commercial initiatives. ----- EBITDA Margin increased to 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 10.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by price retention which allowed us to reduce selling prices by proportionately less than the decrease in the cost of recycled fibers and other materials used in our products, and through the aforementioned production and operational efficiencies. _2019 vs 2018_ EBITDA increased by €9.3 million, or 14.7%, to €72.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in revenues from sales in 2019 compared to 2018, partially offset by an increase in the cost of raw materials and services and personnel costs. EBITDA Margin of 10.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was substantially in line with 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as the operational efficiencies were substantially offset by the consolidation of Barcelona Cartonboard starting in November 2018, which had a lower EBITDA Margin.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.59,Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,17.59.2,,"Like all industrial operators, the RdM Group is exposed to the risks associated with the general macroeconomic environment. The 2020 financial year was characterized by the COVID-19 emergency which caused, especially in the first pandemic wave, the temporary closure of many production sectors and a consequent recessionary effect that has not yet manifested in its entirety. As the sector in which the RdM Group operates is highly exposed to strategic productive sectors, mainly the food and pharmaceutical industries, there were no negative volume trends in 2020. This, together with the improvement in contribution margins, enabled the achievement of an excellent profitability level. The general economic situation and the continuation of the health emergency indicate that possible negative effects may occur. Given that the risk cannot be eliminated though it is significantly diminished compared to the beginning of the emergency, the price dynamics of sales of the main raw materials and the actions put in place by the RdM Group will make it possible to mitigate the effects of this risk. As far as raw materials are concerned, the main risk, identified starting in 2018, is that there may be an increase in the price of recycled fiber following the sharp drop in prices seen in 2018, which continued into 2019, mainly due to the decision taken by the Chinese government to implement a waste import ban. The COVID-19 emergency led to a sharp rise in prices in April and May 2020, with a subsequent downward trend towards pre-crisis figures. A new increase took place at the end of 2020 following the increase in demand that was mainly due to the corrugated cardboard sector, and this inflationary ----- trend has continued into 2021. As is taking place throughout 2021, the RdM Group believes it can offset any raw material price increases by adjusting the sales prices of its products. With regard to energy prices, all of them declined markedly in 2019, particularly gas, electricity and coal, after they reached a high of previous years in 2018. 2020 saw a further decline in all energy components due to COVID-19; however, energy prices have risen significantly throughout 2021. Within this scenario, the RdM Group will continue with its energy consumption efficiency policies and investments aimed at reducing them.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The RdM Group has many tools to effectively manage this risk: insurance agreements were entered into with a leading credit insurance company and various agreements were also entered into for the non-recourse assignment of receivables. Any uninsured and/or uninsurable positions are monitored continually by the appropriate corporate functions, with the support of external sources of information and monitoring for the Italian customer base. In order to contain this risk, the RdM Group checks risky positions vigilantly and promptly.

The estimates and assumptions used are based on experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used to measure any provisions for doubtful receivables, inventory obsolescence, depreciation and amortization, write-downs, employee benefits, restructuring funds, taxes, other provisions, funds, and valuations of derivative instruments. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of any changes are recognized in the income statement in the period in which the estimate is revised (if the revision affects only that period) or in the period of the revision and future periods (if the revision affects both current and future periods). In this respect, the situation caused by the present economic and financial crisis has led to the need to make assumptions regarding future performance which are characterized by significant uncertainty; as a consequence, therefore, actual future results may differ from the estimates. Although not foreseeable at present, this could have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of the items in question. The valuation methods and the main assumptions used by management in applying accounting standards which relate to the future development of operations are described below. These methods and assumptions may have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, meaning that adjustments may need to be made in future years, with similarly significant effects on these amounts. _Trade and other receivables_ Trade and other receivables are initially measured at the fair value of the amount to be received. Subsequent adjustments are made to account for any write-downs. Non-current trade and other receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost. _Fair value of derivative contracts and financial instruments_ Derivative instruments consist of assets and liabilities measured at fair value. In accordance with IAS 39, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting only if all of the following apply: - the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception; - the hedge is expected to be highly effective; - effectiveness can be reliably measured; - the hedge is highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it is designated. The fair value of financial instruments which are not listed on a regulated market is determined by employing various valuation techniques. In this respect, the RdM Group uses those techniques which it believes are the most reasonable in connection with the specific financial instruments that have to be valued, and it adopts assumptions and makes estimates based on market conditions at the reporting date. _Taxes_ Current income taxes are based on an estimate of the taxable income for the year and on current legislation in the countries where the RdM Group operates. The expected liability, net of any payments in advance or withholding tax incurred, is recognized under Current taxes. ----- Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base. Deferred tax liabilities consist of deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences which will be taxed in future years in accordance with prevailing tax legislation. Deferred tax _liabilities consist of taxes which, despite being recoverable in future years, refer to the current year and are_ recognized where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to absorb their recovery. Deferred tax liabilities were offset by deferred tax assets where conditions specified in IAS 12 were met, notably where the two items relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and where there is a legally enforceable right to offset in this manner. Income taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly credited or charged to shareholders’ equity, in which case the tax effect is recognized directly in that item. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the carryforward of unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the unused tax losses can be used. RdM and some of its Italian subsidiaries (R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l.) participated in the national tax consolidation scheme pursuant to Article 117 et seq. of the Consolidated Income Tax Act (“TUIR”). The Company acts as the consolidating company and becomes a single taxable base for the group of adhering companies, thereby enabling this group to offset taxable income against tax losses in a single tax return. Each company participating in the national tax consolidation agreement transfers its taxable income or tax loss to the consolidating company: as a consequence of this transfer, RdM recognizes a receivable or a payable corresponding to IRES (corporate income tax), net of any payments on account, from or to the participating company, depending on whether it contributes taxable income or a tax loss. The subsidiary RdM Blendecques S.A.S. is also part of the national tax consolidation agreement that includes the subsidiaries R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S. and R.D.M. Marketing France S.A.S. on the basis of Article 223a of the French General Tax Code. The overall determination of tax expense may require the use of estimates and valuations, including those relating to any specific tax liabilities which may not be determinable at the time the individual transactions are carried out. Additionally, in order to calculate deferred tax assets, the RdM Group employs estimates and valuations which also take into account expectations of future events. _Impairment test_ At each reporting date, the RdM Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to assess whether there are any impairment indicators. If any such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated through an impairment test to determine the write-down amount. The RdM Group has used the procedure described in IAS 36 to identify the cash-generating units representing the smallest identifiable groups of assets which generate cash flows that are largely independent within the consolidated financial statements. The lowest segregation of assets for cash generating units (“CGU”) is represented by the individual mills. The recoverability of carrying amounts at this level of aggregation is tested by comparing the net carrying amount of the Net Invested Capital of the individual CGUs with the value in use represented by the current value of the estimated future cash flows from the continuing use of the assets making up the CGUs and that of their terminal value. The impairment test relating to the CGUs is carried out from the asset side perspective, estimating the operating value or the enterprise value of the CGUs. Note that the scope of the CGUs coincides with an entire legal entity, as in the case of the foreign companies R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH, RdM Blendecques S.A.S., R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S., Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. and the Italian companies R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and PAC Service S.p.A., or with the production plants of Santa Giustina (BL) and Villa Santa Lucia (FR), belonging to the parent company RdM. It should be noted that as at December 31, 2020 no impairment indicators were identified and therefore the company did not prepare any impairment test. However, against the signing of an option contract for the sale of R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S., held through the subsidiary RdM Blendecques S.A.S., wrote down some of tangible assets related to the subsidiary subject to options for a total of €3.7 million in order to align its carrying amount using the fair value method deduced from the sale costs. This value represents the best estimate of the directors on the basis of the data that was available on the date of the valuation, including the variable components of the sale price earn out) determined on the higher EBITDA realized in financial years 2021-2023, compared with the reference value. Additionally, an impairment test is conducted annually on the PAC Service S.p.A. CGU as a result of the goodwill of €4.4 million allocated to it at the time of acquisition. Based on the impairment test conducted, no need for any write-down was identified. The main assumptions used by the RdM Group in measuring the recoverable amount (value in use) are: ----- a) estimates of future operating cash flows; b) the discount rate; and c) the final growth rate. In making these forecasts, the RdM Group used assumptions based on the following key variables: the estimate of future sales volumes, variable costs of energy and packaging, the trend in sales prices, margins, capital expenditure and macroeconomic variables. The RdM Group has used a net rate of 6.04% when discounting cash flows, which reflects current market assessments and also takes into account the specific risks of the sector. During the development of the impairment test, the terminal value was determined by using a growth rate (“g rate”) of 1.5%. The result of the impairment test, approved by the Board of Directors, is based on information currently available and estimates regarding changes in a series of variables. For this reason, based on the recommendations included in Joint Document no. 4 of the Bank of Italy, Consob and ISVAP of March 4, 2010, the RdM Group prepared sensitivity analyses on the results of the tests, basing these on changes in the underlying assumptions (use of the growth rate in calculating the terminal value and discount rate) that affect the value in use of the cash generating units. There has been no need for a write-down following these sensitivity analyses. Moreover, as indicated in the Directors’ Report on Operations, following the spread of COVID-19, that has impacted the national and international scenario since January 2020, further sensitivity analyses on the forecasts of future economic financial flows and on the main scenarios used to test the capital assets have been made. Based on these analyses, any elements have not been identified that could constitute an impairment of cash generating units. Considering that recoverable amounts are calculated on the basis of estimates of future growth, the RdM Group cannot be certain that a revision of these estimates, and the resulting adjustment to values, will not be required. The RdM Group will continually monitor the changing situation in order to make any necessary revision to the assumptions underlying the estimates. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

This total capacity is split between different paper grades including (i) WLC, which represents 48% of the total capacity, (ii) folding box boards (“FBB”), which represents 39% of the total capacity, (iii) solid bleached sulphate (“SBS”), which represents 10% of the total capacity and (iv) coated unbleached kraft (“CUK”), which represents 3% of the total capacity. WLC grades are manufactured from recycled papers and are referred to as recycled grades whereas FBB, SBS and CUK grades are manufactured from virgin fibers and are referred to as virgin grades. Cartonboard is used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications across both food and nonfood end-markets. Although cartonboard is widely used across industries, each of the types of paper grades has unique properties that make it particularly suitable for certain specific uses. - WLC is used in a wide range of applications which includes cereals, dry foods, frozen and chilled foods, pharma and personal care, detergent powders, confectionery outers, toiletries, household goods, electrical, engineering products, car spares, do-it-yourself products, gardening, toys and games. In addition, WLC is available to provide fat resistance and other barrier properties when specially treated, which can make it suitable for use in fast food, pet food and soap packaging. - FBB is used in applications such as cosmetics, chocolate and sugar confectionery, medical and healthcare, toiletries, dry foods, frozen and chilled foods, coffee and tea, biscuits and baked goods, clothing, toys, games and photographic products. - SBS has excellent printing, structural design and embossing characteristics and is accordingly used in luxury products and for products where hygiene and preservation of a product’s aroma or flavor is critical, such as packaging for perfumes, cosmetics, chocolates, pharmaceuticals, frozen foods and cigarettes. - CUK is used in applications requiring either very high strength cartonboard or cartonboard that is relatively good at remaining strong when wet. It is also referred to as carrier board since in addition to folding cartons it is used for multipack applications in canning and bottling. The graph below shows the 20 folding cartonboard producers with the greatest production capacity as of the end of the second quarter of 2021, which account for approximately 90% of the European production capacity at such time according to a leading industry consulting firm.

WLC’s middle layers consist of recycled pulp made from mixed recovered papers or used cartonboard and containerboard between a top layer and a back layer. The top layer is typically either pulp made from selected white-grade recovered paper or bleached chemical pulp. Selected recovered paper can also be used for the back layer. The overall recycled content of WLC pulp typically varies from approximately 80% to 100%, as virgin pulp may be added to enhance structural integrity. The top surface of WLC will typically have two or three layers of white pigment coating to allow for brighter images and coloring when the cartonboard is printed on by customers, and the back layer may have a coating of white pigment or may be left unpigmented, resulting in a grey or brown hue depending on its exact recycled-fiber composition. WLC is produced on board machines in several stages. Firstly, a dilute suspension of cellulose fiber (pulp) in water is formed into a thin layer of entangled fibers on a moving plastic mesh, known as the wire. Some of the water drains away and additional layers of pulp are added to achieve the desired grammage, thickness and composition of the cartonboard. The remaining water is extracted by pressing and drying the board; this process results in inter-fiber bonding that gives the recycled cartonboard its strength and rigidity. The board may then be coated if applicable to enhance the whiteness, smoothness and surface finish for printing, varnishing and general appearance. Finally, there are a number of finishing operations that take place such as slitting, reeling, sheeting, labelling, palletising and wrapping with moisture resistant material for storage and distribution.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Accordingly, the packaging industry is evolving and increasingly substituting single-use plastic products with recyclable fiberbased alternatives. Industry sources suggest that the current macroeconomic outlook is constructive for the WLC market and support a strong relationship between demand for packaging, overall economic health and increasing gross domestic product, as growth of disposable income and consumer spending as well as industrial production result in increased consumption of packaging products. ----- The overall packaging landscape has been impacted by broad demographic and lifestyles trends, including a growing preference for sustainable packaging among consumers, increasing demand for convenience via take-away and home deliveries, and the growth in e-commerce. These trends support demand for cartonboard packaging, which we believe will also increasingly benefit from trends favoring lighter-weight and reduced packaging, reflecting the general focus on reducing packaging financial costs and negative environmental impacts. For example, Coca-Cola has started replacing plastic film wrap with cartonboard multipack packaging and Garnier has relaunched its Ultra Doux line of shampoos in a solid bar format encased in recyclable cardboard packaging. Despite the impact of these factors, we believe plastics and reusable transit packs will continue to compete with cartonboard packaging, especially in more established markets and for applications that involve direct contact with food. The future competitiveness of recycled fiber-based packaging will depend on innovation, product development, cost and the industry’s ability in general to respond to changing market requirements. _Legislation_ Directives regarding the packaging industry are an important factor driving plastic substitution trends and providing attractive market opportunities for new solutions. The European Union is currently reviewing key legislation related to fiber-based industry. For instance, the single-use plastics directive (“SUPD”), which bans or enforces restrictions on several single-use plastic items, is currently under review and there is the possibility that its scope will be broadened, such that both polymer-coated cartons and dispersion-coated boards could fall under it. Another important directive is the packaging and packaging waste directive (“PPWD”), which sets recovery and recycling targets that EU countries must meet depending on the packaging material. Based on an industry research, we believe the scope of the PPWD could be expanded to include, among other things, restrictions on over-packaging and mandates concerning usage of recycled content except in materials that come in contact with food due to safety reasons. Based on industry research, we believe the legislative and regulatory environment is likely to continue to drive the packaging industry towards more sustainable solutions, which should increase the use of recycled paper-based packaging. _Emerging Trends_ Industry data suggests that there are notable differences in the way the end market segments served by the packaging industry are evolving: - Food segment: Packaging demand remains stable within this segment, with evolution instead driven by demographic changes and trends, such as the trend toward increasing focus on convenience among consumers. The potential to replace plastic packaging represents a significant opportunity for us, which has been driven, in part, by restrictions on the use of plastic, retailers’ sustainability targets and increasingly favorable consumer sentiment towards sustainability. - Pharma & Beauty segment: Packaging demand is expected to grow steadily within this segment, with evolution driven by increased personal spending and an ageing population. - Food Service segment: Growth driven by increasing personal spending on “to-go” and delivery food which also benefitted from COVID-19-imposed closures and contingency measures to limit social interaction. - Retail segment: While demand generally mirrors the macroeconomic backdrop, retail has seen an increase in packaging demand driven by the expansion of e-commerce. - Graphical & Cigarette segment: the segment is experiencing declines, particularly as the global smoking population declines due to increased awareness of the adverse health effects associated with smoking. ----- _Customer Base_ In Europe, the customer base for folding carton board is very fragmented; there are more than 500 converters and the largest five own only around 30% of regional capacity. Converters are located throughout Europe in order to be closer to brand owners — large global consumer goods or food companies — who buy finished or semi-finished packaging for their consumer goods and food products. Converters supply the final packaging products to the brand owners, who typically work with few to several suppliers and have strong power in the value chain. Key purchasing criteria for converters and ultimately brand owners depends on the end-use and on quality requirements. Typically, stiffness, smoothness and strength are the key quality properties for cartonboard. Brightness can also be a key quality parameter when printability is important. Sustainability is also playing an increasingly important role within key purchasing criteria. Local brands and smaller converters usually make their purchasing decisions based on availability, cost and suitability for their machinery, whereas higher-end brands tend to focus on quality over costs. _Historical Growth Trends_ According to a leading industry consulting firm, the European folding cartonboard market has shown a stable average growth in demand of 1.1% per annum since 2002. FBB, followed by WLC, has significantly outperformed SBS and CUK grades in demand growth.

According to a leading industry consulting firm, the end-use segments that have mainly driven by the growth of WLC demand have been food, pharmaceuticals and beverages. These segments have grown at 1.4%, 3.2% and 1.2% per annum between 2015 and 2020, respectively. According to a leading industry consulting firm, European WLC demand is expected to grow by 1.1% per annum, or over 420,000 tons by 2030, mainly due to two drivers: - End-use development: positive market development across end uses (+1.4% per annum) led by Food end-use demand, especially from growth in frozen and chilled food. - Sustainability trends: WLC is expected to gain popularity across end uses, benefiting from consumer sentiment, plastic bans and extended packaging responsibility (“EPR”) fees. Moreover, we mainly operate in the Southern European WLC market, in which growth is expected to outpace growth in the broader European market. Industry sources suggest that the Southern European WLC ----- market could achieve growth of 1.4% per annum to 2030, which corresponds to more than 166,000 tons by 2030. According to industry sources, the accelerated growth in this market relative to the broader European market is due to the strong position of WLC in the Southern European market and a slightly higher growth in demand than the European average. ##### 2020-2030 WLC Demand in Europe and Southern Europe _Million tons of demand_ 4.15 3.73 ### // 2020 2030 1.24 1.07 ### // 2020 2030 _Figure 5 — Source: leading industry consulting firm. Pricing Dynamics_ According to a leading industry consulting firm, prices for WLC are expected to remain high throughout 2021 and into 2022 but then decline after such period as a result of two primary drivers. First, new capacity in Turkey may enter the market in 2022-2023, which would weaken the supply-demand balance. In addition, according to this leading industry consulting firm, the prevailing view in the market is that recycled-fiber prices are expected to decline relative to the current prices as collection disruptions normalize. However, given the local nature of WLC business and the practical difficulties and expense of supplying WLC to distant customers, we believe Turkish capacity dynamics will mainly impact Turkey and the Middle East, and have significantly less impact in our core markets in Southern and Central Europe. Moreover, we believe that once the new capacity is absorbed by the market, prices will first stabilize at a new floor, and then we expect an upside push driven by improved supply-demand balance and recycled fiber prices. The graph below shows how the global WLC order backlog during the third quarter of 2021 has reached almost three times the value of the backlog reported in the third quarter of the prior two years. _Figure 3 — Source: Company Information based on CEPI as of September 2021 (calculated based on a five-week moving average)_ ----- Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prices of recycled fiber have sharply increased, with several factors contributing to this unprecedented dynamic: - As lockdowns and restrictions on “brick & mortar” retail activities were implemented all over the world, there has been an unprecedented surge in corrugated packaging demand driven by e-commerce; - New corrugated capacity coming online during this period; - Rates of recycled paper collection have fallen below their pre-pandemic levels, which has been particularly true of urban areas where labor shortages have contributed to this dynamic; - There have been repeated coronavirus-sparked logistics disruptions, which has led to shortages; and - Collection has been challenging as the amount of recycled fiber that ends up in mixed waste has been greater than usual, which results in lower-quality recycled paper grades. However, according to an industry study, recycled fiber prices are expected to decline to normalized levels in 2022 owing to: - “Return to normality” following successful vaccination campaigns; - Increased recycled papers collection rates due to fewer logistic challenges and improved labor availability; - Improvement in the quality of the PfR stock following the re-opening of “brick & mortar” shopping and greater numbers of workers returning to their offices, which is expected to reduce mixed waste contamination; and - Further reduction in recycled paper exports from Europe, as other South East Asian countries, including Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia implement waste import bans similar to that of China. The graph below highlights the recycled fiber pricing dynamic expected over the next five years according to a leading industry consulting firm. _Figure 4 — Source: Leading industry consulting firm WLC Historical Spread Development_ Notwithstanding the evolution and volatility of recycled fiber prices described above, producers in the WLC industry have historically been able to pass through increases in input cost to customers and thereby ----- preserve their spread (defined as difference between selling and input prices), even in periods of rapid and significant cost increases. Moreover, as the graph below shows, while sale prices, old corrugated containers prices and spread have fluctuated across cycles — for example they experienced a strong rebound after the 2008 global financial crisis — there has been a general strong long-term trend toward increasing spreads over time. _Figure 5 — Source: Leading industry consulting firm_ There are several reasons behind this long-term historical spread upward trend, both related to structural features of the market and to the companies operating in the sector. One of the structural features is that EU is a net exporter of recycled paper owing to its overcapacity, its increasing recycling rates and the EU directives on waste reduction and plastic packaging. In addition, there are also macroeconomic forces that may impact these dynamics. For instance, the Chinese import ban on the European waste announced in late 2017 preceded a decrease in observed prices in the following years. Moreover, the fact that larger paperboard producers are price setters and that the WLC is more costcompetitive compared to other grades have considerably contributed to the upward trend in margin.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

As a result, our overall solidboard production capacity amounts to approximately 359,000 tons per year, making us the largest producer of solidboard in Europe among nonintegrated producers (i.e., producers who do not also operate as converters). ----- Solidboard is a niche paper grade, with a total global market estimated to be approximately 3,800,000 tons in 2019. It is expected to reach approximately 4,000,000 tons in 2023. Currently, the demand for and the production of solidboard is mainly concentrated in Europe and North America, but it is increasing in Asia due to two main factors: (i) the push towards sustainable and recyclable products has created a substitution opportunity for solidboard at the expense of plastics, and (ii) the substitution risk from other materials and virgin boards is limited due to the unique technical capabilities of solidboard. Moreover, unlike the broader board market where several types of boards are becoming increasingly commoditized, solidboard occupies a high value-added market niche and is used primarily in high-complexity end-markets.

In the consumer and luxury business sector there are already >400 major companies that have declared their commitment towards the reduction of plastics usage. In general, attention to and awareness of the benefits of recycling is increasing in media, politics and corporations and within society at large. Developing countries are shifting their attention towards introducing and improving their recycling and collection programs as opposition mounts against products with poor recycling rates (e.g., single-use plastics). Sustainability is not the only fundamental that we believe supports the future success of the solidboard sector. For instance, we expect luxury packaging to grow substantially (5% 2019-2023 CAGR according to Management’s estimates) on the back of demographic and economic developments, especially in Asia, contributing to increasing demand for solidboard. The grade is used in high-end packaging for several luxury products including jewelry, fashion, wine and spirits, perfumes and cosmetics, as well as consumer electronics and fine foods. These end markets also represent a major force in product innovation, as luxury brands constantly look to evolve and develop their packaging. In addition, demand from traditional end-markets is expected to maintain a stable growth path over the coming years due to defensive characteristics as well as attractive niches that are rapidly developing. This is the case of bookbinding, whose demand has been stable over the past years and it is expected to slightly grow in the future, with some segments, such as hardcover books, coffee table books and children’s books, expected to experience more robust growth. Also puzzles and games are expected to slightly grow in the coming years, benefitting from increasing popularity across all age groups and geographies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Paper can be produced using different types of fibers, either fresh virgin (wood) fibers or recycled paper. The majority of recycled paper is collected from households and from the commercial and industrial industries, where paper-based packaging accumulates. However, the amount of paper that can be recovered is largely dependent on legislation that regulates who is allowed to collect and how paper is separated at the source. This has an impact on production, as it is costly to sort mixed waste (paper) streams afterwards and comingling general waste and wastepaper deteriorates fiber quality. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

In 2017, China, historically one of the largest importers of recovered paper from Europe, announced a ban on waste imports. Even though China has stopped importing from Europe, there is still an indirect demand for recovered paper via other regions and in general the outflow from the continent is expected to continue. Moreover, demand for recovered paper is also driven by sustainably secular trends. With this regard, cartonboard and solidboard represent attractive solutions in several industries as they are made of recovered paper from municipal, commercial and industrial paper collection systems. In 2020, within the European paper industry, the usage of paper for recycling was stable compared to 2019, at approximately 50 million tons, with an additional net volume of 6 million tons (11% of the total 56 million tons) bought by non-European countries. As discussed, China is no longer a main importer of European recycled paper. Within the EU, material differences exist among the major European economies, with Germany and Spain being net importers of both brown and white recycled paper grades, while Italy and France are net exporters. Overall, in Europe, where paper collection is an advanced practice, collection rates for paper and boards are already high (especially in industrial and retail). According to EUROSTAT, the paper and cartonboard recycling rate is close to 85%. ----- ##### Collection Potential in Europe (m ton) **69** **72** **72 17 20 23 55 51 47** 2020E 2025 2030 Brown Grade White Grade **+3 -6 +9** _Figure 11 — Source: leading industry consulting firm._ A crucial element impacting recycled paper is regulation. Collection is regulated at the European, national and municipal levels. The “Green Deal” signed in 2019 and the “EU Waste Shipment Regulation Evaluation” represent an action plan to boost a clean circular economy, restore biodiversity and decrease pollution, which requires increasing waste collection and recycling. With this aim, different levels of restrictions for the import and export of waste are under consideration and countries are taking actions to introduce bans on waste imports and tighter regulation concerning waste quality and contamination. More specifically, the “Waste Framework Directive” (Directive 2018/851), places a hierarchy of waste management solutions: (i) waste prevention, (ii) reuse, (iii) recycling and (iv) other forms of recovery and disposal, setting specific targets for the EU member states. According to the directive, the re-use and recycling of municipal waste shall be increased to a minimum of 55%, 60% and 65% by 2025, 2030 and 2035 respectively. Moreover, the “Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive” (Directive 2018/852/EC) sets out measures and requirements for the prevention, re-use and recovery of packaging waste within the Member States.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

We operate in the white lined chipboard (“WLC”) and solidboard (“SB”) market segments, in each case with a demonstrated track record of making our operations more sustainable as both WLC and SB are manufactured from recovered paper. Our cartonboard can be used as both primary and secondary packaging, and applications of our packaging include, without limitation, food packaging, shoe boxes, trays, toys, furniture, displays, bookbindings, boxes and puzzles. Our identity is built on a clear vision centered on the circular economy that guides our activities as a manufacturer of WLC and SB from recycled materials, and that represents a balanced combination between our business and the expectations of our stakeholders; see also “Business — Our Production Process — Circular Business Model.” Our ambition is to be the partner of choice of all key stakeholders with three strategic goals in mind: to offer excellent products and services, to optimize costs and to maximize the satisfaction of our customers, all while helping drive increased sustainability within the paper and packaging industry. We serve our customers through a network of nine mills, five sheeting and distribution centres, and ten sales offices. As of December 31, 2020, we employed over 1,990 employees (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We believe that our geographical footprint across Europe and exposure to resilient end-markets (such as the food end-market) are key strengths of our business, which we have reinforced through the recent Eska Acquisition and Paprinsa Acquisition. Our position as a leader in the European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills, our “multi-mill” concept, whereby we seek to be able to offer the same cartonboard products at different mills, helping us provide highly localized delivery quickly and better meet our customers’ demands. Our distributed mill network is integrated by our “One Company” operating model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent. - WLC. In our WLC market segment, we produce cartonboard from recycled fibers for folding carton and corrugated packaging applications. We are the second largest WLC producer (based on annual production capacity as of December 31, 2020), with a market share of approximately 25% for 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition), in a highly fragmented European market. We are also the largest WLC producer based on our annual production capacity as of December 31, 2020, in Italy, France and Spain. In terms of production capacity, WLC represents approximately 76% of our business as of December 31, 2020 (giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We had a total WLC production capacity of 1,166 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition). - SB. In our SB market segment, we produce solidboard from recycled fibers for packaging and graphical applications. We had a total production capacity of 359 thousand tons per year for the year ended December 31, 2020 (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition). In terms of production capacity, SB represents approximately 24% of our business as of December 31, 2020 (giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal). We are a leading solidboard producer with a global reach. Following the Eska Acquisition, we now have two industryleading solidboard production facilities (in terms of production capacity) in The Netherlands with the largest SB production capacity among participants in the core market segments in which Eska operates (which include luxury packaging, bookbinding, puzzles and games) for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 (after giving pro forma effect to the Eska Acquisition, the Paprinsa Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal as if they had occurred on October 1, 2020), we generated adjusted pro forma consolidated revenues from sales of €853.9 million, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of €119.2 million and an Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA Margin of 14.0%, and we had Adjusted Pro Forma tons sold of 1,451 tons.

Our position as a leader in the European WLC market is supported by our distributed network of mills integrated by our “One Company”operating model, which helps to ensure we have both a local presence near our customers and a platform with the scale and sophistication required to efficiently respond to our customers’ needs across the continent. As a leading WLC manufacturer, we are poised to benefit from the growth and evolution of the WLC market. Industry sources indicate that the WLC market segment is resilient and diversified. Moreover, the demand for WLC in many of our key end-user markets (such as the food end-market) in Europe has grown at a rate exceeding that of the industry-wide average, according to analysis from an industry leading consulting firm. The chart below presents (based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm) demand for WLC for 2015 and 2020 for each of Europe and Southern Europe (which includes Spain, Italy and France). #### Evolution of Historical WLC Demand in Europe _Million tons of demand_ 3.7 3.6 1.1 1.0 ## // // 2015 2020 2015 2020 ###### Europe Southern Europe Just as the demand for WLC ultimately depends on the demand from the end-markets, the resilience of the WLC industry is also supported by the diversity and by the resilience of the industry’s end-markets. The chart below is based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm and highlights how the WLC demand is driven by the stable and resilient food end-market. Food end-market demand is defined by different sub-segments, such as frozen and chilled food (19% of total demand), driven by demographic changes and convenience trends, dry food (16% of total demand) and other food sub-segments (12% of total demand). Overall the broad food end-market represents approximately 50% of the total demand for WLC. ----- ### WLC Demand By End-use Markets Other Non-Food 20% Frozen & Chilled Food 19% Cosmetics & Beauty 5% Pharma 6% Liners 14% Confectionery 4% Dry Food 16% Other Food 12% Beverages 4% We believe a number of market trends will continue to support WLC market development in Europe over the next several years — with Southern Europe expected to experience even stronger demand growth as a consequence of WLC’s stronger position in the region — and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends. In particular, we believe that the growing preference for sustainable products, along with increasing regulatory actions against the use of plastics and plastic packaging will likely cause a growing number of manufacturers to switch from plastic packaging to more sustainable alternatives, such as WLC packaging made from recycled fibers by producers like us. Additionally, we expect growth in e-commerce to drive demand for WLC liners used in packaging production. Also, we expect demand for frozen and convenience foods to increase due to demographic shifts and changes in consumer preferences favoring convenience, and these segments of the food end-market are especially heavy users of WLC packaging. The chart below shows (based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm) the development of WLC end-usage between 2015 and 2019 with 91% of the above mentioned WLC demand from growing endmarkets, mainly the food end-market. Essential and highly resilient end segments such as broad food and pharmaceuticals have experienced the highest historical demand growth. ###### Historical WLC Development by End-Markets 2015-19 _LHS: 1,000 Tons %: Increment per annum 2015-19_ 50 - (50) ----- In addition, the charts below illustrate (based on analysis from an industry leading consulting firm) the estimated growth in WLC usage in Southern Europe for the periods indicated, as well as the estimated growth (2019-2030) for the various WLC end segments. These changes are driven by, among others, a preference for fiber-based materials and sustainable products, increased popularity of frozen and chilled foods driven by geographic changes and convenience trends, and increased focus on replacement of plastic packaging by sustainable options in light of brand owners’ and retailers’ sustainability targets in response to increasing consumer sentiment favoring sustainability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

This growth is primarily driven by: (i) strong opportunities in luxury packaging, an end-market expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% to 2023, as a result of increasing disposable incomes worldwide and increasing requests for innovative, aesthetically pleasing and high quality products; (ii) developments in bookbinding and stationery, driven by rising literacy rates in emerging markets and rising incomes in Asia; and (iii) increasing popularity in puzzles and games due to an increased desire to disconnect from the digital world and from the innovative development of puzzles and games. The graph below illustrates the solidboard market segmented by end-use for the year ended 2019 (expressed in percentages and excluding packaging solidboard). The trend towards sustainable and recyclable products further favors the use of solidboard, a material that is fully recyclable, instead of plastics, and we expect to have the opportunity to drive plastic substitution via the solidboard market as well, helping to further increase packaging sustainability while simultaneously increasing our company’s financial performance and growth. Through the Eska Acquisition we believe we are well-positioned to further expand our products and offerings in the solidboard market segment. Eska is a leading provider of high-quality solidboard, serving, and often operating as a long-term partner to, over 700 customers globally. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Eska sold 241 thousand tons and generated €149 million of revenues from sales.

Our multi-mill concept represents one of our core operating principles. We aim to produce our products in multiple mills whenever possible to ensure that our products are available to our customers in a flexible and punctual manner and in close proximity to their production sites. We believe that the multi-mill concept allows us to adopt efficiently to changes in market demand and the economic cycles of the individual countries in which we operate. We believe we have a well-invested asset base, in terms of capacity, technical age, speed and trim compared to our industry peers, which enhances our ability to effectively pursue our multi-mill concept. We currently serve our customers through a network of nine mills, five sheeting and distribution centers, and ten sales offices. Our mills are located in Italy, Spain, France, The Netherlands and Germany, giving us a pan-European and strategic asset base close to our customers. Rather than managing each single mill to produce a single product, our mills are designed, and operate, to manufacture multiple products whenever possible. As a result, we can shift production of many of our products across our network of mills, which gives us flexibility to balance the availability of products at individual plants and to integrate production planning across our mills. We also believe that our multi-mill concept reinforces the benefits that we believe we derive from our multi-country asset base. By increasing the interchangeability of our mills and the specific types of our cartonboard produced in multiple mills, we also increase our ability to meet our customers’ needs at each local plant. This allows us to reduce the time and cost required for product delivery and to be more immediately responsive to customers’ needs and changing demands, providing meaningful upside in a market characterized by localized preferences and requirements. Our focus on coordination within our multi-mill network also allows us to monitor and better respond to market volatility arising from rapid changes in local demand or changes in production at individual mills as well as from potential supply chain disruptions. As part of the integration of the Eska business following the Eska Acquisition, we intend to also apply our multi-mill concept to our growing solidboard business. In particular, we plan to extend the multi-mill concept into our specialty product line using the two newly acquired Eska mills and our Ovaro mill. We believe that the multi-mill concept and post-acquisition integration will allow us to transfer production volumes to different locations to reduce delivery times for existing customers as well as to find new and more profitable markets and volumes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Moreover, we believe that broad trends in the grocery industry will further support food as being an attractive end-market for our business. For example, we expect the continued increases in demand for packaged goods as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing proliferation of product lines as a result of emerging brands and sub-brand fragmentation to drive additional demand for WLC packaging.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Due to our leading position and size, and we have historically been able to maintain selling prices higher than industry averages and to consistently strengthen our margins. In addition, we are generally not bound by long-term sales contracts, but operate instead through purchase orders, which gives us flexibility to respond to market conditions. See also “Business — Our Customers and Stakeholders.” Historically, we have generally demonstrated our ability to pass through increases in input cost pricing, particularly in fibers, to our clients. We have historically been able to unilaterally increase our selling prices without impacting our volume sold. We believe that our ability to successfully defend our margins arises from our strong leadership position in the market, our long-lasting relationships with customers, and low demand volatility. In addition, the cost of packaging is usually a small portion of the total cost of goods for brand owners. In 2021, following increases in the cost of raw materials and energy costs, we successfully implemented or are implementing five price increases, and our customers have accepted those increases without a negative impact on our volumes of tons sold.Generally, price increases are communicated in advance to our customers (effective from a certain date in the future) and the resulting higher prices take effect only for the orders made by clients from that specific day. This creates a time lag between when the rise in input prices occurs, which is almost immediate, and the effectiveness of the selling prices increases, which might take up to three months, depending on the level of backlog (i.e., the larger the backlog, the longer it takes for the new prices to manifest in new order prices and in our reported revenue).

In the first nine months of 2021, we successfully implemented four sale price increases, and implemented a fifth in November 2021. In particular, and as described above, in November leveraged the clauses in our purchase order agreements which provide for raising prices retroactively to orders already booked in extraordinary situations. These clauses enabled us to apply the increase to all orders already booked with a delivery date subsequent to November 1, 2021. On a cumulative basis, including the last November price increase, we have increased prices by over €200 per ton in 2021. However, despite the magnitude of this cumulative increase, our high customer retention and strong market share have endured, and clients have accepted those increases as reflected by the absence of a negative impact on sales volumes, which in 2021 YTD have grown by comparison to the same period of 2020. Because the first four announced price increases were applicable only to new orders received from the date of applications (i.e., not retroactively), and given the high level of backlog, their effective impact on our financial performance has been delayed for a period of months as set by the backlog. The fifth price increase in November raised prices retroactively to address this, eliminating the lag time and more immediately positively impacting financial performance. The charts below reflect an adjustment to certain measures of our profitability (contribution margin and EBITDA) to normalize for the timing lag associated with the first four, non-retroactive price increases by applying the effect of the following month’s actual order prices. By applying the following month’s actual order prices to the price received for a given month’s sales volumes, we lessen the timing lag and the associated profitability impact and better match the price we are able to command at a given time with the timing of realized increases in input costs. _Figure 1 — Source: Company Information. RDM EBITDA Normalization calculation Figure 2 — Source: Company Information. Eska EBITDA Normalization calculation_ ----- We believe that we are well-positioned within the market to implement price increases, as evidenced by our history of passing along our price increases without significant reductions in volumes sold or a significant impact on our customer relationships.

(“Cartiere del Reno”) was founded in Italy, in Bologna. Cartiere del Reno subsequently followed a path of steady growth and expansion, through the acquisition of industrial plants (including the Ovaro production plant, in 1985) and corporate transactions (such as the acquisition of Cartiera Binda De Medici, in 1986). In 1986, Cartiere del Reno changed its name into Reno de Medici S.p.A. (“RdM”). In 1996, as a result of our initial public offering, our shares began trading on the Milan stock exchange. In the following years, our strategy further developed through the mergers with the Italian company Saffa in 1997 and the Spanish company Sarrio in 1998. ----- Concurrently, Casades Inc. had been founded in Canada in 1964, operating as a cartonboard manufacturer, and had been active in Europe since 1985, when they had acquired their first European production site at La Rochette, as well as additional European facilities in France, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. In 2008, RdM and Cascades Europe Group combined their manufacturing plants in a newly formed company which continued to operate under the name RdM and combined their sales activitites in another entity named Careo Group. In 2017, RdM, Cascades La Rochette and Careo Group merged into a single entity: the RdM Group. In 2018, we have started implementing a three-year transformation plan (the “Transformation Plan”) which we are now continuously improving. The goals of the Transformation Plan are the integration of our pan-European asset base under a “multi-mill concept” and the transformation of RdM into a truly unified “One Company”, through a portfolio of value added initiatives. To achieve these goals, we are continuously working to meet certain targets that we have identified in specific areas, including: (i) increased resilience in operational performance and in consolidated EBITDA margin, (ii) increased speed in capturing signals and promptly turning them into better solutions for the clients and higher margins for us, (iii) more sophisticated demand/supply integration and optimization, (iv) further improvement on optimization of sourcing and procurement and management of operations, (v) reduction of costs per ton, (vi) exploitation of new receipes and energy efficiency solutions, (vii) optimization of price mix, (viii) acceleration in the innovation of sustainable products and (ix) digitalization of manufacturing and services processes. In particular, in the context of the Transformation Plan, we acquired: - in 2017: PAC Service S.p.A., an Italian company operating in the field of cutting and processing cardboard. This acquisition allowed us to (i) reinforce our supply chain integration strategy, (ii) smooth through-the-cycle raw material prices, and (iii) further expand our presence in Italy; - in 2018: Barcelona Cartonboard SAU (“Barcelona Cartonboard”), a Spanish company operating in the coated cartonboard sector. This acquisition allowed us to (i) strengthen our recycled cartonboard presence, (ii) broaden our production capacity, and (iii) increase our proximity to key European converters (our customers); - in 2020: Papelera del Principado S.A. (“Paprinsa”), a Spanish company operating in the recycled WLC business. This acquisition allowed us to (i) solidify our leading WLC position in Southern Europe, (ii) support our multi-mill approach, and (iii) increase our potential for production capacity; and - in 2021: Fineska Group (“Eska”), a Dutch company leader in high-quality solid boards. This acquisition allowed us to (i) enlarge our recycled fiber-based production, (ii) expand our product offering through presence in the solidboard market, (iii) enhance RdM brand recognition in the high margin luxury packaging business and (iv) expand our global presence. Also, in 2021, the full divestment of our interests in the French former subsidiary R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S.

Firstly, a dilute suspension of cellulose fiber (pulp) in water is formed into a thin layer of entangled fibers on a moving plastic mesh, known as the wire. Some of the water is extracted by drainage and further layers of pulp are added to enhance the grammage, thickness and composition of the cartonboard. The rest of the water is extracted by pressing and drying, a process during which inter-fiber bonding develops and the board is formed. The board is usually coated to improve the whiteness, smoothness and surface finish for printing, varnishing and the general appearance. Finally, there are a number of finishing operations such as slitting, reeling, sheeting, labelling, palletising and wrapping with moisture resistant material for storage and distribution.

We believe that we are strong contributors to the circular economy, with which we have a symbiotic relationship. We are committed to upholding this continuous, virtuous and sustainable production cycle for the long term. All of our products are fully recyclable, enabling them to be converted to packaging at a later stage. Furthermore, approximately 94% of the fibrous materials we use comes from recycled materials (after _pro forma effect to the La Rochette Disposal) and over 83% of all materials used consist of renewable materials,_ enabling us to foster the circular economy. Operating in a circular economy is key to our business model, replacing the idea of “waste” with the concept of “resource.” This regenerative system is based on the efficient use of raw materials, giving them a new lease on life. We believe that we are key to the circular economy itself, being the “link in the chain” between production of cartonboard and paper for recycling (“PfR”), because we transform PFR into cartonboard, which is then transformed into packaging by our clients and, in turn, more than 80% of the packaging produced by our clients is recycled on average after use. Adopting a circular approach means looking beyond the initial production cycle and embracing greater responsibilities to our society and environment. See also “— Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters.” The main steps of our manufacturing process can be described as follows: - We source PFR in the form of used fiber-based packaging, newspaper and magazines from local industrial and commercial companies and from local municipal paper collection. Our technology and production systems transform the PFR into cartonboard, giving the recycled fibers a new life. - The fiber-based raw materials are mixed with water to create a cellulose fiber suspension (i.e., a pulp of cellulose fibers), and the impurities (e.g., sand, metals and plastics) present in the raw materials are eliminated through a complex purification system. - The pulp suspension is formed in the wet section of the production process to a fiber web board and then further pressed and dried to remove the water and, depending on the type of cartonboard, a coating layer may be applied to it. ----- - Once produced, the cartonboard is rolled onto special reels for direct dispatch or cut into sheets and packaged onto pallets. Our products are primarily intended for the converting and printing industry, using our cartonboard to make the packaging for the products placed on the market. Clipping and scraps resulting from the converting and printing processes are collected and delivered back to the mill, either directly or through sorting facilities as raw materials. As for the products that are delivered on the market, once the final consumers have used them, more than 80% of the packaging is eventually reintroduced into the virtous cycle of recycling, thereby feeding the sustainable business model of recycled cartonboard.

Our cartonboard is fully recyclable and designed to be reintroduced into the paper circular economy cycle after use, and it is biodegradable if it is not properly disposed of or recycled. To produce our products we rely on PFR (94%) and virgin market pulp (6%) (after giving pro forma effect to the La Rochette Disposal) and over 83% of all materials used consists of renewable materials. In addition, all our plants are certified according to FSC® and/or PEFC standards, which are the two most widespread and globally recognized standards for ensuring that raw materials come from a chain-ofcustody controlled supply chain. For our virgin market pulp supplies, we choose only certified and/or controlled raw materials from sustainable supply chains. In particular, 100% of all virgin market pulp that we use (after giving pro forma effect to the Paprinsa Acquisition, Eska Acquisition and the La Rochette Disposal) is FSC® or PEFC certified, or FSC® controlled wood. In order to have a consistent and adequate supply of raw materials, we typically enter into multi-year agreements, as customary in our industry. In certain countries, such as Germany, The Netherlands and United Kingdom, the supply for PFR is granted through certain procurement agreements. We are also part of a number of yearly purchase agreements, which are renegotiated on a yearly basis. In Italy, we are member of the National Consortium for the Recovery and Recycling of Cellulose-based Packaging (“Comieco”) and such membership grants us certain guaranteed supply quantities at a fair market price. Changes in raw material prices may impact our results of operations and while we generally do not have clauses for the pass-through of input costs predefined in our sales contracts, we have historically been able to pass through increases in these costs through the regular renegotiation of contracts with our customers.

See “— Investments and Divestments.” _The Sheeting Centers_ Each of our mills has the capacity to perform the cutting activity through which our products are made in the size and format requested by our clients. In addition, we have four sheeting centers that focus on cutting activities and serve as warehouses. Two sheeting centers are located in Italy, near Milan (R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l.) and near Padova (PAC Service S.p.A.), respectively. The activity performed in these two centers consists of cutting cartonboard sheets in the format required by clients from cartonboard reels. The activities conducted by R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l. and by PAC Service S.p.A. are slightly different. R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l. operates as a service provider of the Group, receiving reels of products from other RdM facilities, cutting them and then delivering them to the final customers. R.D.M. Magenta S.r.l. also provides this kind of service to a limited number of external customers. PAC Service S.p.A., instead, buys reels (half of which from other ----- RdM facilities, at arms-length), cut them in small, customized lots and is able to deliver them to clients within 48 hours. Customers generally pay more for the kind of service offered by PAC Service S.p.A. vis-à-vis the ordinary purchase of cartonboard. We also own an additional sheeting center in Spain (Eska Sheeting Center Barcelona), which is equipped to cut sheets to the required size and to repackage them for shipment to clients. Eska Sheeting Center Barcelona also has a stock of customer specific boards which can be cut to size and quickly delivered to clients when needed. Finally, we operate one sheeting center in the U.S. (Eska Sheeting Center Chesapeake) which, like Eska Sheeting Center Barcelona, has a warehouse where a broad range of top-selling and customer-specific board is kept in stock and this stock can then be cut and quickly delivered to clients when needed. Finally, we also own a large warehouse facility in Milan (Eska Distribution Center Milan) which serves as a distribution hub for our Group. No cutting activities are performed at this location. _Our Sales Network_ We have ten sales offices spread across nine European countries, some of which also sell products to neighbouring countries. Most of our sales are directly managed by our employees from the sales offices. In order to penetrate those geographic areas, which are not physically close to our sales offices, we employ certain agents that report to our relevant sales offices.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.127,Investments and divestments,17.127.1,,"From time to time, we enter into material acquisitions and distribution insourcing transactions, which grow our business both vertically and horizontally, increasing our presence and capacity in our core segments. The following paragraphs describe our most significant acquisitions and distribution insourcing transactions finalized in the recent past. Barcelona Cartonboard Acquisition (2018) We acquired Barcelona Cartonboard in October 2018 for an enterprise value of €46.4 million. Founded in 1967, Barcelona Cartonboard operates in the WLC market segnment. The acquisition of Barcelona Cartoboard allowed the RDM Group to strengthen its presence in a well-known market, to optimize its product portfolio and to further improve the level of service to current customers and new ones by decreasing the time it takes to serve certain strategic customers. This acquisition also enhanced our product portfolio optimization, and contributed to leveraging our multi-mill concept. See “Summary — Our multi-mill concept _provides us with significant competitive advantages.”_ Paprinsa Acquisition (2021) We acquired Paprinsa in July 2021 for an enterprise value of €31 million. Paprinsa is one of the main European players in the WLC sector. It operates one of the mills with the lowest technical age (10-15 years) and the largest trim width (4.8 meters) on the market. Paprinsa is specialized in the production of cartonboard from recycled fibers (WLC), microflute and corrugated sheets, serving the packaging industry in Spain and abroad. It utilizes one of the most up-to-date technology mills in Europe due to significant investments in the last six years, including more than €30 million of capital expenditures. It is also one of the European mills with the largest trim width (4.8 meters), giving us the opportunity for future production growth. Overall, this acquisition allowed us to (i) consolidate our leading WLC position in Southern Europe, (ii) support our multimill approach, and (iii) increase our potential for capacity via an additional shift we will be able to add in the plant. Eska Acquisition (2021) We acquired Eska in July 2021 for an enterprise value of €155 million. Eska is a Dutch company and the world’s leading pure-play provider of high-quality solidboard, operating as long-term partner to more than 700 customers globally. It operates two industry-leading production facilities in The Netherlands (the Hoogezand and Sappemeer mills). See “— Our Mills.” The two Eska facilities have the largest combined ----- production capacity in Eska’s core market segment, solidboard. This acquisition allowed us to enlarge our recycled fiber-based solidboard production, to expand our product offerings and to leverage our multi-mill concept in the solidboard sector, in which we can now operate with three plants. The Eska Acquisition will also broaden our geographical presence, extending our coverage in the Asian and American markets and giving us further EU exposure in the key Nordic market. La Rochette Disposal (2021) In April 2021, we sold RDM La Rochette, the only company of our group operating in the FBB market, for an enterprise value of €28.8 million. The rationale of this divestment was to leave the FBB market in order to focus on WLC and solidboard. La Rochette did not represent a competitive asset in our portfolio in terms of quality, technology and capacity relative to best-in-class manufacturers of FBB. Investing in La Rochette would have been expensive and would not have yielded an attractive return on investment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

In particular, it is acknowledged that the Issuer and/or Guarantor will not opt (where possible) for the Imposta Sostitutiva regime pursuant to Article 15 and subsequent of Italian Presidential Decree no. 601/1973, as amended and supplemented from time to time.

- if providing such security or granting such guarantee requires consent before such assets may be secured or where providing such security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of those assets or require any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to certain conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors (but without adverse impact on relationships with third parties); - if providing such security or granting such guarantee would have a material adverse effect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) on the ability of the Issuer or any Subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture, or materially adversely affects the tax arrangements of the Issuer or such Subsidiary or any direct or indirect equityholder of the Issuer, and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this principle provided that the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle; - if security over such assets or guarantee from such person is required to support acquired indebtedness to the extent such indebtedness is not restricted by the Indenture, or if the terms of the documentation governing such acquired indebtedness prevents the granting of such security or guarantee; - if the time and cost (including material adverse tax consequences or adverse effects on interest deductibility and stamp duty, registration taxes, notarisation and registration fees) of providing a guarantee or security (and the terms or perfection of such security) is disproportionate to the benefit of obtaining such guarantee or security; - no member of the Group will be required to grant security or guarantees if it is not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of RdM (or MergerCo subsequent to the Merger) or to the extent that to do so is not within their legal capacity or where to do so would conflict with the fiduciary duties of directors or contravene any legal prohibition, contractual restriction or regulatory condition or would result in (or in a risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any director or officer, provided that the relevant entity shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle; - the Group will not be liable for any fees, costs, taxes, expenses or other amounts payable in connection with any re-taking, re-registration, re-notarization or other requirement for perfection, presentation, novation or protection of security or guarantees on transfers or assignments by the holders of the notes; - if the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or limited to minimise fees and duties where the benefit of increasing the guarantee or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees and duties; - any Security Document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence or for the document to bear a “certified date”as a matter of Italian law and where possible, the transaction security documents governed by Italian law will be executed by way of exchange of correspondence (scambio di _corrispondenza commerciale), or outside Italy, in order to minimise any documentary tax cost connected_ with their execution;

- in the case of security from or guarantees over, or over assets of, any joint venture, non-wholly owned subsidiary or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any entity that is not wholly-owned, including, in the case and for so long RdM is not wholly-owned, certain general limitations and restrictions may delay or impair the ability of the Issuer to cause RdM to provide a guarantee and the granting of security, such as any necessary approvals by independent directors, the requirement for any transactions to be on arm’s length terms, corporate benefit requirements and directors’ duties to act in the best interest of RdM, as well as potential challenges imposed by the presence of minority shareholders and, for as long as RdM remains listed, certain the requirement for additional corporate actions and approvals in accordance with applicable regulations, including pursuant to the requirements of Article 2391-bis of the Italian Civil Code and CONSOB Regulation No. 17221 dated 12 March 2010 (and subsequent updates) concerning transactions with related parties; - if certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or another external body’s) consent may be required to enable the provision of a guarantee or security; - certain notifications, deliverables and other notices will only be provided at the request of the Security Agent after the notes are accelerated (subject to certain exceptions) and no notices shall be required to be sent to insurers, third party debtors or other contractual third parties prior to an acceleration that is continuing; - in the case of assets subject to security which is a Permitted Lien; and - no control agreements or control, lockbox or similar arrangements will be required with respect to any deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodities accounts or other assets.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under the caption “— Optional _Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price._ A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control, with a purchase date to occur upon, or within a specified period of time not to exceed 15 days after, the consummation of such Change of Control. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14(e)-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of such covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance. Debt agreements to which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a party may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing any notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing any notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of such notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Credit Agreement will, and future credit agreements or other debt agreements to which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Credit Agreement or such other Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such defaults or seek to refinance our Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Credit Agreement and such other Indebtedness, such defaults could result in amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement and such other Indebtedness being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the holders of notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Indebtedness — Future _liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including an event deemed not to be a change of control when, at the time of such event, our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels.”_ The Change of Control purchase feature of the notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present ----- intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings, securitizations or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. See “Risk Factors — Risks _Related to Our Indebtedness — Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including an event deemed not to be a change of control when, at the time of such event, our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels.”_ The definition of “Change of Control”includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control with respect to the notes has occurred and whether a holder of the notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes. If and for so long as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if such events have occurred, (ii) make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension Period on the Issuer’s and its Subsidiaries’future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the holders of the notes of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

With respect to clauses (d)(1), (k), (r)(ii), (s)(i) and (x) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness as Ratio Debt, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred as Ratio Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Indebtedness Incurred or deemed Incurred under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (a) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness. The Issuer will also be entitled to divide, classify or reclassify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types permitted in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant without giving pro forma effect to the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant when calculating the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) that may be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Debt Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid (including the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Closing Date), shall, at the option of the Issuer, only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount or deferred financing costs, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same class, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once and guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the outstanding, in the case of term debt, or, if greater, committed principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing. ----- Financial Calculations._** When calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture, in each case in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, Irrevocable Repayment or similar transaction where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, Irrevocable Repayment or similar transaction are entered into and such Applicable Metric shall be calculated on a _pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment,_ Irrevocable Repayment or similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness (and the use of proceeds thereof) and Liens) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such Applicable Metric is exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such Applicable Metric shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness (and the use of proceeds thereof) and Liens) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any Applicable Metric under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro transaction is made. No Default or breach under the Indenture shall arise merely as a result of any subsequent change in currency exchange rates. In respect of any four full fiscal quarter period, exchange rates used in relation to an item of Consolidated Total Indebtedness may be, at the election of Issuer, (i) the weighted average exchange rates for that period, (ii) the exchange rate used in the relevant financial statements as of the last day of such period, (iii) the exchange rate as in effect on the date that Indebtedness was incurred or (iv) the exchange rate on the Issue Date; provided that, where applicable and at the election of the Issuer, any amount of Indebtedness will be stated so as to take into account the hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in respect of or by reference to that Indebtedness. Any Applicable Metric where an element is set by reference to a percentage of EBITDA shall be tested by reference to the applicable level of EBITDA for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation. If any Lien, Indebtedness, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment or other transaction, action, judgment or amount (any of the foregoing in concurrent transactions, a single transaction or a series of related transactions) is incurred, issued, taken or consummated in reliance on categories of baskets measured by reference to a percentage of EBITDA, and any Lien, Indebtedness, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment or other transaction, action, judgment or amount (including in connection with refinancing thereof) would subsequently exceed the applicable percentage of EBITDA if calculated based on the EBITDA on a later date (including the date of any refinancing or re-classification), such percentage of EBITDA will not be deemed to be exceeded. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”): (i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries during ----- such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”) provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent such Applicable Metric provides an alternative method of increasing the amount permitted by that Applicable Metric by applying unused capacity from prior periods or capacity from future periods (an “Alternative Carry Forward/Back Provision”), the Issuer may choose to apply either the provisions of this clause (i) or the applicable Alternative Carry Forward/Back Provision when calculating the Applicable Metric but Alternative Carry Forward/Back Provision may not be combined with the provisions of this clause (i); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount. Limitation on Restricted Payments._** The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of the Issuer’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any payment made in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer (other than dividends, payments or distributions (A) payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or in Subordinated Shareholder Debt, or (B) by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities); (2) purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer; (3) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, in each case prior to any scheduled repayment or scheduled maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than the payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement of (A) Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement and (B) Indebtedness permitted under clause (h) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “— Limitation on Incurrence of _Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”);_ (4) make any Restricted Investment; or (5) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (5) above, other than any of the exceptions thereto, being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment: (a) solely with respect to Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) through (3) and clause (5) above, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof immediately after giving effect thereto; (b) solely with respect to Restricted Payments described in clauses (1) through (3) and clause (5) above, immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary could Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness as Ratio Debt pursuant to clause (a) of the ----- proviso to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “— Limitation on Incurrence of _Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; and_ (c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2) (with respect to the payment of dividends on Refunding Capital Stock pursuant to clause (b) thereof only) and 6(c) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of, without duplication, (1) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) from September 30, 2021 to the end of the Issuer’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit), plus (2) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and the Fair Market Value of assets other than cash, received by the Issuer after the Issue Date from the issue or sale of Equity Interests or Subordinated Shareholder Debt of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer (excluding (without duplication) Refunding Capital Stock, Designated Preferred Stock, Cash Contribution Amount, Excluded Contributions and Disqualified Stock), including Equity Interests issued upon conversion of Indebtedness or upon exercise of warrants or options (other than an issuance or sale to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries), plus (3) 100% of the aggregate amount of contributions to the capital of the Issuer received in cash and the Fair Market Value of property other than cash after the Issue Date and, without duplication, the aggregate amount of cash and the Fair Market Value of property other than cash that becomes part of the capital of the Issuer through amalgamation, consolidation or merger in exchange for the issuance of Equity Interests of the Issuer or a direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer after the Issue Date (in each case, other than Excluded Contributions, Refunding Capital Stock, Designated Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock and the Cash Contribution Amount), plus (4) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness, or the liquidation preference or maximum fixed repurchase price, as the case may be, of any Disqualified Stock, of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof issued after the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock issued to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that has been cancelled, retired or extinguished without consideration from the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests in the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or assumed by a third party to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from their obligations in respect of such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock without consideration from the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case after the Issue Date, plus (5) 100% of the aggregate amount received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in cash and the Fair Market Value of property other than cash received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from: (A) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Subsidiary) of, or other returns on Investments from, Restricted Investments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and from repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries by any Person (other than the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) and from repayments of loans or advances, and releases of guarantees, which constituted Restricted Investments (other than in each case to the extent that the Restricted Investment was made pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph), (B) the sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the Capital Stock of an ----- Unrestricted Subsidiary (provided that such amount will not be included in Consolidated Net Income for the purposes of the preceding clause (1) to the extent that it is (at the option of the Issuer) included under this clause (5)(B)), or (C) any distribution or dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (provided that such amount will not be included in Consolidated Net Income for the purposes of the preceding clause (1) to the extent that it is (at the option of the Issuer) included under this clause (5)(C));

In the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) is divided, classified or reclassified under clause (22) above or clause (31) of the definition of “Permitted Investments”(such clauses, the “Incurrence Clauses”), the determination of the amount of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment that may be made pursuant to the Incurrence Clauses shall be made without giving pro forma effect to any substantially concurrent Incurrence of Indebtedness to finance any other Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof) divided, classified or reclassified under any of the above clauses or the definitions thereof other than an Incurrence Clause.

provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings or new arrangements are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially more restrictive as a whole with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or advances made to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances. Asset Sales._** The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the Equity Interests issued or assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto or, if Incurred, increased or decreased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected in the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the notes thereto if such Incurrence, increase or decrease had taken place on the date of such balance sheet, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes) that are assumed by the transferee (or a third party on ----- behalf of the transferee) of any such assets or Equity Interests or that are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction with such transferee; (b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days of the receipt thereof (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received); (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) €30 million and (y) 25% of EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation, at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); (d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and (e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary received from Persons who are not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision. Within 18 months after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, at its option: (1) to repay Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); (2) to repay Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), provided that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall so reduce such Indebtedness, the Issuer or such Guarantor will equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the notes (A) through open-market purchases (provided that such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof), (B) by redeeming notes if the notes are then redeemable as provided under “— Optional Redemption” or (C) by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders of the notes to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any; (3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), or assets, property or capital expenditures in each case used or useful in a Similar Business, or to make an investment in one or more New Projects, or to make acquisitions or investments not prohibited by the indenture, or to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Cash Proceeds was contractually committed; (4) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), properties or assets that replace the properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Cash Proceeds was contractually committed; (5) to repay Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is ----- revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (6) any combination of the foregoing, _provided that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the provisions_ described in clauses (3) and (4) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 18 months after the Asset Sale that generated the Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to acquire the assets or Capital Stock of a Similar Business, make an investment or make a capital expenditure in compliance with the provision described in clauses (3) and (4) of this paragraph (an “Acceptable Agreement”) with the good faith expectation that such acquisition, purchase or capital expenditure will be completed within six months after the end of such 18month period; provided, further, that if any Acceptable Agreement is later cancelled or terminated for any reason after the end of such 18-month period and before an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds is applied, then such unapplied amount shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below) unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding agreement (a “Second Acceptable Agreement”) within six months of such cancellation or termination of the prior binding agreement; provided, further, that the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may only enter into a Second Acceptable Agreement under the foregoing provision one time with respect to each Asset Sale and to the extent such Second Acceptable Agreement is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds is applied or is not applied within six months of such Second Acceptable Agreement, then such unapplied amount shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Pending the final application of any amount, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise use such amount in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. Any amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale that is not applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the two preceding paragraphs (it being understood that any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase notes, as described in clause (2) above, shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) €24 million and (y) 20% of EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation (the “Excess",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to the Applicable Percentage of Excess Proceeds within ten (10) Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceeds the Excess Proceeds Threshold by mailing or electronically sending or otherwise providing in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may, at its option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to an amount equal to or less than the amount of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 18 months (or such longer period as provided above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds below the Excess Proceeds Threshold. To the extent that the aggregate amount of notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount of Excess Proceeds with respect to which an Asset Sale Offer has been made, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use such remaining Excess Proceeds (the “Declined Excess Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of ----- Excess Proceeds subject to the Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer shall select or cause to be selected the notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero. If the aggregate principal amount of notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds subject to the Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer shall select or cause to be selected the notes in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such notes are listed (and the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of any such listing), or if such notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable, by lot or by such other method as the Issuer deems appropriate. Selection of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that ranks equally in right of payment with the notes or the relevant Guarantee will be made pursuant to the terms of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness. The procedures for an Asset Sale Offer will be substantially the same as for a Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Future credit agreements to which the Company becomes a party may limit or prohibit the Company from purchasing any notes as a result of an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Company is required to make an Asset Sale Offer at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing the notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

However, a Default under clause (3) or (4) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes notify the Issuer of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clause (3) or (4) hereof after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer) is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes by written notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the notes to be due and payable.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (including, without limitation, the declaration of acceleration of the notes) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the notes, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, default, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default or acceleration that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured or waived. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes have requested in writing that the Trustee pursue the remedy; ----- (3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book Entry Interests in a Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. ----- The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The CRS requires certain financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence procedures.

Interest will be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on a provisional basis and will then be included in the relevant Italian resident noteholder’s annual income tax return. As a consequence, Interest will be subject to Italian ordinary income taxation and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a credit that can be offset against the income tax due.

Moreover, subject to certain conditions, depending on the status of the investor and percentage of participation, income realized by Real Estate Funds is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units or shares on a tax transparency basis. _Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_ If the Noteholder is resident in Italy and is an open-ended or closed-ended investment fund (other than a Real Estate Funds), a SICAF (other than a Real Estate Funds) or an investment company with variable capital (società di investimento a capitale variabile, or “SICAV”) established in Italy (together, the “Funds”) and either (i) the Funds or (ii) their manager are subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the relevant Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest accrued during the holding period on such Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, nor to any other income tax in the hands of the Funds.

For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change of the ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change of the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

Under certain conditions and limitations Noteholders may set off capital losses with their capital gains. In respect of the application of CGT, taxpayers may choose one of the three regimes described below: (A) under the tax declaration regime (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian resident individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains, net of any incurred capital loss of the same kind, realised by the investor pursuant to all sales or redemptions of the Notes carried out during any given tax year. The relevant Noteholder must indicate the overall capital gains realised in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual tax return and pay CGT on such gains together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realised in any of the four succeeding tax years; (B) as an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian resident individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realised on each sale or redemption of the Notes (risparmio amministrato regime provided for by Article 6 of Decree 461). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to (i) the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorised financial intermediary (including permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries) and (ii) a valid express ----- election for the risparmio amministrato regime being timely made in writing by the relevant Noteholder. The depository is responsible for accounting for CGT in respect of capital gains realised on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realised upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss, and is required to pay the relevant amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, where a sale or redemption of the Notes results in a capital loss, such loss may be deducted only from capital gains subsequently realised, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains in the annual tax return. (C) any capital gains realised by Italian resident individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to an authorised intermediary and have opted for the so called risparmio gestito regime provided for by Article 7 of Decree 461 will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realised, at year end, subject to a substitute tax at a rate of 26%, to be paid by the managing authorised intermediary. Under the _risparmio gestito regime, any depreciation of the managed assets accrued at year end may be carried_ forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains realised in its annual tax return. Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected may be exempt from Italian capital gain taxes, including the CGT, on capital gains realised upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes, if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a _lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Italian law, as amended and implemented from time to_ time. _Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_ Any capital gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of the taxable income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of the net value of the production for IRAP purposes) if realised by an Italian company or a similar commercial entity (including the Italian permanent establishment of foreign entities to which the Notes are connected), Italian resident commercial partnership or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected. _Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_ Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder who is a Real Estate Fund will be subject neither to CGT nor to any other income tax at the level of the Real Estate Fund. Subsequent distributions made in favour of unitholders or shareholders and income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in the event of redemption or sale of the units or shares will be subject, in certain circumstances, to a withholding tax of 26%. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, depending on the status of the investor and percentage of participation, income realized by Real Estate Funds is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units or shares on a tax transparency basis. _Funds_ Any capital gains realised by a Noteholder who is a Fund will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period which is exempt from income tax.

The Issuer intends to take the position that there is no more than a remote chance that ----- it will make such payments and the Notes should accordingly not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes because of these additional payments. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) that it is taking a different position. Assuming such position is respected, U.S. Holders would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with their method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as CPDIs, U.S. Holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the Note and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange or redemption of the Note.

The term “qualified stated interest”generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. Stated interest on the Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated in euros will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment based on the “spot rate” (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may recognize exchange gain or loss when it disposes of any euros it receives (as discussed below under “— Disposition of Euros”). An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the interest payment is actually paid or received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual payment or receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that receives a stated interest payment denominated in euros (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), may recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the amount of such stated interest payment previously accrued during such accrual period, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. _Foreign Tax Credit_ Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) and OID (as defined below) will generally be considered income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the ----- U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits.

U.S. Holders generally will be required to include any such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). U.S. Holders of the Notes with less than the de minimis amount of discount will include the discount on such Notes in income, as capital gain, when principal payments are made on the Note. In the event the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such Note (“accrued OID”). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided _that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs_ either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Notes as of the issue date. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods applicable to accrual basis U.S. Holders described above under “— Payments of Stated Interest — Euro Denominated Stated Interest.” A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the Euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the “U.S. dollar cost”of the Note to such holder increased by any previously accrued OID and decreased by any cash payments on the Note other than ----- qualified stated interest. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about how to account for proceeds received on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of Notes that are not paid in U.S. dollars Except as discussed below with respect to exchange gain or loss on a Note attributable to currency fluctuations, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S.-source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any long-term capital gain will generally be subject to preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes. The gain or loss that a U.S. Holder realizes on the taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S.-source for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Such exchange gain or loss will generally equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of the Note based on the spot rate of exchange on (i) the date of the disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “— Payments of Stated Interest” or “— Original _Issue Discount,” as applicable.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, income earned through a U.S. or non-U.S. partnership or other pass-through entity is attributed to its partners or owners. Accordingly, if a partnership or other pass-through entity holds the Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner or owner of such entity will generally depend on the status of the partner or other owner and the activities of the partnership or other pass-through entity that holds the Notes. Tax consequences to partners or owners of a partnership or other pass-through entity that is a U.S. Holder are not discussed in this summary, and such investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors. The summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences set out below is for general information only and does not constitute, and should not be considered as, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of owning the Notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to be entered into in connection with the Notes, the Issuer has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuer. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 40 days after the Issue Date. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions to non U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer _Restrictions.”_ Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and ----- - the offering of the Notes has not been registered with the CONSOB and that (i) it has not and will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes in the Republic of Italy to any natural persons nor to entities other than to qualified investors (investitori qualificati) as defined by Article 2, paragraph (e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation and in other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the EU Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended from time to time, and the applicable Italian laws; and (ii) it has not and will not issue, distribute or publish in the Republic of Italy any document relating to the Notes, except under circumstances that will result in compliance with this Offering Memorandum and all applicable laws, orders, rules and regulations. Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes in the European Economic Area to retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client”as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a “customer” within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation. Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes in the United Kingdom to retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client”, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a “customer” within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are MiFID II appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are UK MiFIR appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” ----- The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price, which will be favorable to you. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6 1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Stabilizing Manager may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Stabilizing Manager to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, including in the context of the MTO and/or in the ordinary course of business, in lending, advisory, investment banking, corporate finance services, commercial banking transactions and/or other commercial dealings with, and may provide services to, us and our affiliates and/or to the parties directly or indirectly involved in the Offering as well as in the MTO. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments or those of our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including, potentially, the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes and would bear the costs deriving from a possible (total or partial) cancellation of the bond hedging swaps. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective ----- affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. For example: (i) the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers and lenders with respect to the Bidco Loan which will be refinanced with a portion of the proceeds of the Notes; and (ii) the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have provided commitments with respect to certain bridge loan financing in relation to the Refinancing that we expect will be cancelled following the issuance of the Notes; and (iii) the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers and lenders with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility. They have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions, certain of which are payable with proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. In addition, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. acts as a leading intermediary bank for the Issuer in connection with the MTO and will receive commissions for these activities rendered in the context of such offer. Moreover, currently Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is a specialist to RdM with respect to the financial instruments issued by the company. Apollo Global Securities, LLC is an affiliate of our Principal Shareholder, may participate as an initial purchaser and, in the event it elects to participate as an initial purchaser, will receive a portion of the gross spread as an initial purchaser in the sale of the Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment”(within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. ----- Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.2,Italy,214.2.1,Limitations on granting security interests and on enforcement under Italian Law,"Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While ----- corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. _Financial assistance_ In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. _Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_ Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such ----- maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a _rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on_ behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and ----- interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,”since there is no established concept of “trust”or “trustee”under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a _società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) ----- during the period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable subordination” rule.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “the suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “— Certain Italian insolvency laws considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, among others, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; ----- - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian usury law; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be enforceable; ----- - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of RdM and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of RdM. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests granted by RdM be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security ----- interests could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to RdM will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force and effect. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitarions set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-adhering creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182 decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-adhering creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors. The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount. Pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to: (i) incur in new super senior (prededucibile) indebtedness subject to authorization by the court; (ii) secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors; and (iii) pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. The aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to Article 182-quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 ----- of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so-called prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor. The court must decide on the request within 10 days from the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. _Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for _concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such_ publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (for example, concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties ----- of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such preliminary petition where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and — if appointed — the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, pending the concordato in bianco, as well as the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are treated as super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the business continues to be run by the debtor as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior judge’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The concordato _preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal._ Creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not ----- exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest — as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders — to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the_ continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy courtsupervised composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a prebankruptcy court supervised composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and sanctioned (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer_ for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente _eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (for example,_ employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing ----- of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid according to the concordato preventivo proposal. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. _Impacts of the Covid-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_ In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter alia, on insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the continuity of companies throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis before the Covid-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the Covid-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree. Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in a sanctioned concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione _dei debiti based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020. In the procedures for the sanctioning_ (omologazione) of concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020 the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition_ for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato _preventivo in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement_ pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/preinsolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on 31 December 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the Covid-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations. _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: ----- - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the authorization of the designated judge. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration is suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to decide whether to continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by the parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a designated judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare_ provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part, provided that they do not receive less than the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert). The ----- _concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors_ holding the majority (by value) of the claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible”claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. - Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the designated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective _vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency_ declaration. - Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner. (a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the Italian ----- Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (i) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when the new security was granted; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the new security was granted. (b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: (i) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. (c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; (iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato _preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_ (vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and (vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that ----- transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code provides for a “simplified”clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. _Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Amministrazione Straordinaria delle Grandi Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_ The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases — a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario _giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization._ The judicial receiver files a report to the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration proceeding. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the judicial receiver’s report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the inancial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. _Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The ----- Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the judicial phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_ In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the ----- transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a Guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.4,"Law”) and enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so",214.4.2,,"called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency”, hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38 — Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning ----- group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to_ avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been postponed to September 1, 2021 by the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (the “Liquidity Decree”), as converted by Law No. 40 of June 5, 2020, and is now scheduled for May 16, 2022, except for the section named _Parte Prima-Titolo II (“Procedure di allerta e di composizione assistita della crisi,” i.e., the new preventive alert_ and mediation phase), which will entry into force on December 31, 2023, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 dated August 24, 2021, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 202 of August 24, 2021, as converted into law pursuant to Law No. 147 of October 21, 2021, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 254 of October 23, 2021 (the “Law Decree 118/2021”). The main innovations of the Law Decree 118/2021 are the following: (i) additional postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code; (ii) introduction of a new a negotiated composition proceeding (composizione negoziata della crisi) and of a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio); (iii) amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code. The postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, and the amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are effective as of August 25, 2021 (i.e., the day following the publication of the Law Decree 118/2021 in the Gazzetta Ufficiale), while the composizione negoziata della crisi and the concordato semplificato _per la liquidazione del patrimonio are effective as of November 15, 2021. Accordingly, the practical_ consequences of the implementation of such reforms cannot to date be foreseen in their entirety. The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021 requesting the court competent pursuant to Article 9 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law to confirm or modify the protective measures provided for pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021 (the “Protective Measures”) on the same day of the publication of the petition and the Expert’s acceptance (as defined below) in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese), and, if necessary, to enact the _interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”), and (ii) when the_ entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur. The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore _commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to_ their assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law Decree 118/2021, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione _negoziata della crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to a concordato preventivo procedure nor_ for the sanctioning of an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti have been previously filed to the court in such respect and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to corporate groups in order to provide for the possibility of the composizione negoziata della crisi to take place in a unitary form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group companies – at the end of the negotiations – to either enter, as a whole group, into one of the agreements ----- referred to in Article 11, Paragraph 1, of the Law Decree 118/2021 (as set out below), or enter separately as single companies into the solutions referred to in Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021. The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent expert (the “Expert”), through a digital platform (the “Platform”). Together with the petition, the enterprises must file the documents listed under Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021, collectively aimed at giving a clear representation of their financial status and indebtedness. Pursuant to Article 23, Paragraph 2 of the Law Decree 118/2021, access to the composizione negoziata _della crisi is prevented for enterprises having filed a request for the admission to a concordato preventivo_ procedure or for the approval of an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti also pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, or pursuant to Article 182 bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, or a request for the admission to the procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No 3 of 27 January 2012 (i.e., procedimenti di composizione _della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio) pending such procedures._ Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as Expert in the context of a _composizione negoziata della crisi, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur_ during the two years following the dismissal of the composizione negoziata della crisi. The Expert assesses his/her independence, the adequacy of his/her professional expertise and his/her time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by its counsels. If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation, and manage his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the composizione negoziata della crisi does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts. If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she notifies the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of their related effects. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The relevant petition is published in the companies’ register together with the Expert’s acceptance. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting ----- creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. On the same date of the publication of the petition and the Expert’s acceptance in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 1, of the Law Decree 118/2021, the entrepreneur requests the court to confirm or amend of the Protective Measures, and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures. If the entrepreneur fails to file (or delays the filing of) such petition to the court, the Protective Measures are ineffective. Additionally, if the entrepreneur fails to request the publication of the case number (numero di _ruolo generale) assigned by the court within 30 days from the publication of the petition with the companies’_ register, the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures is canceled from the Companies’ Register. Within 10 days from the filing of the petition requesting to confirm or amend the Protective Measures, and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures, the courts schedules a hearing, and upon failure of scheduling such hearing the Protective Measures will become ineffective. At the hearing, the court hears the parties, the Expert and the creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures. The court can appoint a court expert (ausiliario) and carry out all the relevant investigation measures. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations, or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments nonconsistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with in the companies’register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: ----- (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect all the interests involved. The Expert may invite the parties to renegotiate in good faith the conditions of certain contracts (other than employment contracts) if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur. If the parties do not agree, the entrepreneur can file a petition asking the court to amend the conditions of such contracts. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follows: (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In such case, the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, shall not be required. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur may also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: (a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021, which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 can be filed only following the end of the negotiations; (c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021: (i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with_ creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio;_ (ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are ----- consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions provided for pursuant to Articles 216, Paragraph 3, and 217 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio)._ If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and _d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which may contain the division of the creditors into classes. The petition for concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within_ the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply. The court verifies the formal correctness of the proposal, acquires the Expert’s Final Report and an opinion of the Expert on the possible outcome of the liquidation and the relevant guarantees offered thereunder, and (i) appoints a court expert (ausiliario), (ii) gives order to the entrepreneur to notify the proposal, together with the Expert’s Final Report, to the creditors resulting from the list that was attached to the petition for the appointment of the Expert pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021 and (iii) schedules the hearing for the sanctioning (omologazione) of the concordato semplificato per la _liquidazione del patrimonio._ The court issues a decree sanctioning (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_ regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and, in any case, ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. Apart from the Law Decree 118/2021 and the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian Bankruptcy Law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree 83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale); and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. ----- The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi_bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione _del patrimonio described above, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under_ Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. The amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code, will be examined in the following sections. _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike court supervised prebankruptcy composition agreement with creditors and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to clawback action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ----- ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a court supervised prebankruptcy composition with creditors or a debt restructuring agreement. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debts outstanding, subject to court’s sanctioning (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the debt of non-adhering creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non- adhering creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors. The new Article 182 bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. ----- If substantial amendments are made to the plan prior to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), (i) the independent expert carries out a new assessment on the truthfulness of the business and accounting data, the feasibility of the agreement and its attitude to allow payment of the non-adhering creditors within the terms provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (ii) the debtor requests the creditors to confirm their adherence to the debt restructuring agreement. The independent expert carries out a new assessment also in case of substantial amendments to the debt restructuring agreement. If substantial amendments are made to the plan after to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), the debtor amends the plan in order to ensure the performance of the obligations provided under the debt restructuring agreement, and requests the independent expert to carry out a new assessment. In this case, the new plan and the new assessment of the independent expert are published in the companies’ register and notice of such publication is given to the creditors by means of certified mail or certified email. Creditors may oppose the new plan within 30 days from the notice of the publication. Pursuant to Article 182 bis, Paragraph 4, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by the Law Decree 118/2021, the court can sanction the debt restructuring agreement also if the Italian Tax Authority or the Italian Social Security Authority do not adhere, provided that their adherence is essential in order to reach the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and that the claims of the non-adhering Italian Tax Authority and Italian Social Security Authority are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the debt restructuring agreement than as what would be the case in bankruptcy. The adherence of the Italian Tax Authority and of the Italian Social Security Authority must occur within 90 days from the filing of the debt restructuring agreement proposal. Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Insolvency Code. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called “cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-adhering creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser extent than what they would be in the context of liquidation alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa). If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-adhering creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the agreement and refuse to be forced into it. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della _crisi._ Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries and have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects ----- of the agreement to non-adhering creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-adhering creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.5,Germany,214.5.1,Insolvency,"Certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany (such Guarantors, the “German Guarantors”). Consequently, in the event of insolvency of such German Guarantor, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not organized under German law (for example, if the centre of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Antrag auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that, according to German case law, the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks. A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values) unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend _wahrscheinlich)_ for a prognosis period covering the next twelve months (positive _Fortführungsprognose)._ A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debt when they fall due. In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being unable to pay its debt as and when_ they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. ----- If a GmbH (Gesellschaft _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung),_ a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder or partner gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) or under certain circumstances the shareholders of such company must file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay; however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of overindebtedness at the latest six weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably (predominant likelihood) not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, in the case of imminent illiquidity only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings. A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession”proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung), if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turnaround plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless — from a third-party perspective — there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period of either preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung) or the preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. In addition, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, debtors have access to the preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren) even in the state of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) if such illiquidity occurred due to COVID-19. The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended the “COVInsAG”), provided, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until April 30, 2021. The suspension — as in force from January 1, 2021 until April 30, 2021 — applied to debtors who, in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, have applied for financial assistance under state assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or have been prevented, as eligible debtors, from filing such application for legal or factual reasons, unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of obtaining the state financial assistance or the assistance that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the over-indebtedness or illiquidity. The COVInsAG also provides for a certain relief from claw-back provisions, if the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of filing duties, for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Furthermore, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, the COVInsAG reduces the forecast period (Fortführungsprognose) relevant for determining whether a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend _wahrscheinlich) for the purposes of the assessment of the insolvency ground of over-indebtedness from_ twelve months to four months provided that the debtor’s over-indebtedness is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is assumed if (i) the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020 and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019. ----- Further, following heavy rainfall and flooding in parts of Germany in July 2021, on September 7, 2021 the German Bundestag passed an Act, which was approved by the German Bundesrat on September 10, 2021, to establish a special fund “Aufbauhilfe 2021” of up to €30 billion to finance aids for private households, companies and other facilities affected by the heavy rainfall and floodings (Aufbauhilfegesetz _2021 — AufbhG 2021). To further supplement those financial measures, the above-mentioned Act also contains_ a temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until January 31, 2022 if a debtor’s illiquidity or over-indebtedness directly results from the impact of the heavy rainfall and floodings in July 2021 and the relevant debtor conducts serious financing or restructuring negotiations and therefore has reasonable prospects for a successful reconstruction. Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in possession-proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger _Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor._ During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger _Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_ requirements: - a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is overindebted); - revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis. The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der _Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter). The court opens_ formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. In the absence of a debtor-inpossession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, businessexperienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the debtor. Satisfaction ----- of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of assets of a German subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by management of a German subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of a German subsidiary of the Issuer’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against German subsidiaries of the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte _oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_ whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is — in principle — subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte)) as well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment ----- agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the nonpreferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after satisfaction of such secured creditors. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently a new insolvency law on group of companies has entered into force on April 21, 2018 to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), mainly intended to provide for a better coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. It does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code ----- (Insolvenzordnung) in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under “— Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.” Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Any guarantee or other security granted by a German Guarantor incorporated in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”) is subject to certain provision of the Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbHG”). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interest agree to enforce the guarantees or security interest against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and Guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH (incorporated or established in Germany) will contain such limitation language in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), inter alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction ----- effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the subsidiary guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes, of the subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees. Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer should, as of today, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor, the enforcement of the Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded, according to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions (höchstrichterliche Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an affiliated company within the meaning of Section 15 AktG of such guarantor and/or security grantor (other than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of the enforcement of such guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to (former) section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG, now contained in section 15b paragraph 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German Guarantor incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a general partner (Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung) or (ii) an entrepreneurs company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation to such general partner (Komplementär)._",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the security providers under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the security providers for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of ----- the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings, subject to specific periods. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the tenyear period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Guarantees or the security were avoided, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received by the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security interest. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases: - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing); - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (or guarantees) (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such detrimental effect); - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted ----- gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intent to prejudice its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary knew of such intention at the time of such act. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to four years. “Knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the other party knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. In case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments shall establish the rebuttable presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically equivalent claim if (i) in case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debt generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. The COVInsAG, however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans under German insolvency law clawback provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third party ----- financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the abovedescribed rules under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (“Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under “— Insolvency”). Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes or the Guarantees), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can — under certain circumstances — even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “— Insolvency”). The core component of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority ----- of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilisation order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilisation order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilisation order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilisation order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilisation order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

In practice a suspension of payments can result in the bankruptcy of the debtor. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors declare against it. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no ----- suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party or by its own volition the court can order a “cooling down period”(afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by operation of law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The WHOA is inspired by the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the U.S. Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside The Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Notes.Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two third of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the ----- collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above). As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a holder of a Note’s potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These renvooi proceedings could cause holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory ----- judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet)) (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the bankruptcy receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet)), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “— Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.” Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt”obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the Holders under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, Holders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the Holders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The articles of association of each Dutch Guarantor permit ----- the provision of guarantee and security. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company or its administrator in bankruptcy. As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of the security interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that a Dutch Guarantor or the administrator of such Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of a Guarantee or a security interest, such Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the The Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by a Dutch Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

In general, mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to ----- Dutch law. Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte _aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the relevant_ pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable.

The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om _niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing_ or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis _mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy._ In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. If a Dutch court found that the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the granting of the Guarantees or security rights could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the proceedings; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict any such judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grundrechte); - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. ----- Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.3,The Netherlands,215.3.1,,"Each Dutch Guarantor is incorporated under Dutch law and has its registered seat in The Netherlands. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in The Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and The Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in The Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without substantive re-examination or relitigation analysis on the merits if (i) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (ii) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands, (iii) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in The Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is — according to the law of its country of origin — final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in The Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in The Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in The Netherlands will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in euros at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in The Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of The Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolcing Credit Facility Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, TopCo and RdM and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, TopCo and RdM or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws against us or on such other persons as mentioned above in the cours of foreign jurisdiction.

The main recognition, classification and value measurement criteria and accounting standards adopted for the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were the same as those adopted for the preparation of the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, to which reference should therefore be made, with the exception of: a) income taxes, which were recorded according to IAS 34, i.e., by estimating the effective rate expected on an annual basis; b) standards and amendments set out in the following paragraph, possibly applicable with effect from January 1, 2021, as they have become mandatory following the completion of the related approval procedures by the competent authorities. The Group did not adopt in advance any standards, interpretations or improvements, issued but not yet in force. The preparation of interim financial statements requires senior management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the values of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities stated in the financial statements and the information relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim financial statements. Should such estimates and assumptions, which are based on the senior management’s best evaluation, become obsolete in the future due to a different evolution of the operating environment with respect to the forecasts, they would consequently be modified in the period in which the changes occur. For a more extensive description of the Group’s most relevant value measurement processes, please refer to the chapter “Estimates and Special Valuations” of the Consolidated Financial Statements at 31 December 2020. It should also be noted that some valuation processes, in particular more complex processes such as the computation of any impairment value of non-current assets, are generally carried out more thoroughly only when preparing the annual financial statements, as all detailed information is available at such time, or in the event that there are loss indicators that require an immediate assessment of permanent value impairment, if any.

Financial year 2021, just as financial year 2020 before, was characterized by the Covid-19 emergency which, especially in the first pandemic wave, caused the temporary closure of many production sectors and a resulting recessionary effect. Thanks to the high exposure of the sector in which the Group operates towards production sectors considered strategic, especially food and pharmaceuticals, financial year 2021 did not record negative trends in terms of volumes. The general economic situation and persistence of the health emergency in any case suggest not to rule out possible negative effects on volumes. Given that risk cannot be eliminated and is now in any case much lower than at the beginning of the emergency, the trend in selling prices and actions put in place by the Group will make it possible to mitigate the effects of this risk. With regard to raw materials, after the sharp price reductions in previous financial years, the year 2021 reported a very strong increase in the prices of all raw materials and, in particular, of recycled-based fibers. The reasons for this increase can be found in the strong demand for corrugated cardboard due to the expansion of e-commerce and collection even lower than pre-pandemic levels. The Group addressed the commodity price increase with four selling price increases and a further increase announced in October. The deferred effect of the increase in selling prices, also due to the high level of orders, did not allow the Group to recover margins in the short term but will allow it to return to margins in line with expectations in the following financial year. In terms of energy prices, they recorded a sharp decrease in 2020, especially of gas, electricity and coal, after they had reached a peak in recent years, i.e., 2018. In the first three quarters of 2021 on the other hand, there was a strong increase in the price of all energy components and in particular of gas and CO2. Further increases are also expected in the last quarter of the financial year. In this scenario, the Group will continue its energy efficiency policies and investment policies aimed at reducing energy consumption. The strong increases in energy costs were, as usual, taken into consideration in the various selling price increases implemented in financial year 2021, for which reference should be made to the paragraph “Credit Risk”. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Medium / long-term debt amounted to €147.3 million at 30 September 2021; of these, €110.7 million were not hedged at variable rates.

Due to the situation generated following the spread of the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) epidemic, the Group cannot, according to information available, rule out that at least part of its customers may have to face financial tensions with repercussions, at least in the short term, on the timeliness of payments and credit quality, although this risk did not in fact come about throughout the year 2020 and up to September 2021. The RDM Group uses several tools to manage this risk effectively: insurance contracts were entered into with a leading credit insurance company; various contracts for the assignment of receivables without recourse were also signed. Any uninsured and/or noninsurable accounts are constantly monitored by the competent corporate departments, also with the support, as regards Italian customers, of external information and monitoring sources. To contain this risk, the Group adopts a policy of careful and accurate control of accounts considered at risk.

Some loans require certain financial covenants to be respected based on the following ratios: - Net financial position/Shareholders’ equity - Net financial position/Gross operating profit - Gross operating profit/Net financial expense - Shareholders’ equity/Medium-to-long-term debt - Shareholders’ equity/Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2016 The financial ratios are calculated half-yearly or annually, depending on the loan, based on the figures of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. The half-year calculations of the Group’s Gross operating profit and net financial expense are based on the 12-month period ending on the last day of the half-year concerned. In the event of non-compliance with the financial covenants, the lending banks may terminate the loan agreements. In terms of collateral, the Parent Company loan agreement requires RDM, inter alia, to provide mortgages on mills, in the total amount of €130.3 million and a pledge on Fineska shares. In order to reduce the variability of borrowing charges, interest rate swaps have been taken out on the loans outstanding as at September 30, 2021.

The definition of control is not based solely on the concept of legal ownership. According to IFRS 10, the definition of control is based on three elements: (a) power over the business purchased; (b) exposure or rights, at variable returns resulting from involvement with the latter; (c) capacity to utilize the power to influence the amount of these returns. IFRS 10 stipulates that in order to evaluate whether it has control over the acquired business, an investor should focus only on activities that materially affect returns and rights which are substantial, i.e., can be exercised in practice when important decisions have to be taken with regard to the acquired business.

More complex matters and/or those that require greater use of assumptions and estimates are discussed in the section “Estimates and Valuations”. The Group has chosen to present the structure and content of its consolidated financial statements in the following manner: - the consolidated statement of financial position is presented with separate sections for assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities are then presented on the basis of their classification as current, non-current or held for sale; - the consolidated income statement is presented in a vertical format with items broken down by nature, as this provides reliable and more relevant information than a classification by function; - the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is presented separately from the consolidated income statement, and each item is shown net of the tax effect; - the consolidated statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method; - the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity is presented by showing separately the profit or loss for the year and any income and expense recognized directly in equity and not in the income statement, in accordance with specific IAS/IFRS requirements.

Under this method, the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in the income statement at the time they are incurred.

If any such signs exist, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets to determine the write-down amount (impairment test). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value is estimated taking into account the provisions in accounting standard IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. In estimating the value in use, expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.

If any such signs exist, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets to determine the write-down amount (impairment test). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is estimated by taking into account the provisions contained in accounting standard IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. In estimating the value in use, expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a post- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. ----- When there is no longer any reason for an impairment loss to be recognized, the carrying amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to a new carrying amount based on its estimated recoverable value, which may not exceed the net carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized.

When derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatment applies: - for a fair-value hedge (e.g., where a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities yielding or bearing a fixed rate), the derivative instrument is measured at fair value and any gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.

The Group’s only derivative instruments indexed to interest rates are interest rate swaps. A discounted cash flow model is used to measure these instruments, whereby the fair value of a derivative is given by the algebraic sum of the present values of future cash flows estimated on the basis of the risk-free curve of deposit rates, futures and swaps at the reporting date. Additionally, there is a separate commodity swap contract for the subsidiary R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH to hedge purchases of coal, the main energy source of that plant. ----- During the year commodity swap agreements were signed by the subsidiary RDM Barcelona Cartonboard to hedge purchases of gas and sales of electricity. In spite of these agreements having been concluded for hedging purposes, they were not recorded under hedge accounting. The reference international accounting standard (IFRS 13) identifies a measurement hierarchy based on three levels: - level 1: inputs used in measurements are represented by quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities to those subject to measurement. - level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, both directly (prices) and indirectly (derived from prices); - level 3: in the event that observable inputs are not available, and therefore market activity is light or non-existent for the asset or liability subject to measurement, the inputs are non-observable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The following guidelines are used in pursuing this policy: — inflows and outflows in the same currency are offset (natural hedging); — recourse is made to forward sales or to export loans in the same currency. These transactions were arranged by using a notional amount and due date that correspond to those of the expected cash flows (if the amount is significant), so that any changes in the cash flows arising from the forward transactions, as the result of the appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the other currencies, are substantially offset by a corresponding change in the expected cash flows of the underlying positions; — forward sales are hedged. There were no outstanding transactions of this type at the reporting date. As a general rule, the currency-risk management policy recommends maximizing the use of natural hedging and, in any case, excludes recourse to transactions involving complex derivatives, e.g., those with barriers. The Administration and Finance Department of the Group is responsible for monitoring currency risk and recommends suitable currency-risk hedging strategies to keep exposure within the limits agreed with senior management. _Interest Rate Risk_ Financial liabilities exposing the Group to interest rate risk are, for the most part, floating-rate mediumand long-term loans. The table below sets out the positions that are subject to interest rate risk, separating fixed-rate from floating-rate exposure in terms of the nominal value of the financial instruments. However, the exposure to interest rate risk arising from loans is partially mitigated by entering into interest rate swap agreements designed to hedge the volatility of future cash flows indexed to market rates. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Cash flow hedges considerably restrict the impact on financial expense recognized in the income statement. _How Interest Rate Risk is Managed_ The Group uses various debt instruments according to the nature of its financial requirements. In particular, it uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and medium and long-term financing to cover investments in the core business. The techniques used most often are: — advances for short-term requirements. — loans for medium- and long-term requirements. These instruments, which are arranged with leading banks, are mainly indexed to floating rates that are subject to revision every three or six months. The Group’s current risk management policy aims to reduce the variability of the financial expense incurred on its debt and of the related effects on the profit or loss. The practical objectives in terms of risk management therefore involve stabilizing the cash flows linked to the cost of servicing debt in line with budget forecasts. From an operating standpoint, the Group sets about achieving this goal by using derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps (IRS). In line with the features of the transactions carried out and its risk management objectives, the Group has decided to structure its hedging relations using a cash flow hedge approach. Specifically, the hedging relations involve converting floating-rate loan payments to fixed-rate payments. This is carried out by using interest rate swaps (IRS), under which the Group receives a flow of payments from the counterparty bank at the same floating rate as its debt, less the spread. In exchange, the Group makes a payment flow at a fixed rate. The consolidated position (debt + IRS) is therefore a fixed-rate liability of which the amount of financial expense is certain (the aim of cash flow hedging). The present hedging policy excludes the recourse to transactions involving complex derivatives. As at the reporting date, the risk of variability in cash flows linked to floating-rate debt was mainly hedged by derivative financial instruments. _Commodity risk_ In terms of the nature of the business carried out by RDM Group, commodity risk is the risk that the profit for the year will be reduced by incurring higher costs to purchase raw materials for the mills. This risk is part of the broader category of market risk, specifically where the cost of the raw material is dependent on changes in a quoted index. In 2018, the Group signed contracts for the supply of natural gas also for 2019, operating mainly on a quarterly and annual basis, negotiating fixed unit prices for each of the individual quarters of supply. This allowed for a significant reduction in “commodity risk”for the first part of the year and a partial reduction for the last quarter. The quotas relating the last quarter 2019 were negotiated and confirmed over the year in order to meet the mills’ requirements, while benefiting from the decreasing prices for energy commodities. All prices are expressed in Euros per volume unit, with subsequent adjustments to the content of primary energy contained in it. At the end of November 2018, the Group signed contracts for the supply of electricity at a price indexed according to the prices of certain continental energy markets, in some cases by providing fixing operations following the conclusion of contracts by utilizing appropriate clauses in their contracts. Supply quotas at a price indexed relating to reference markets are negotiated with spreads fixed with respect to these prices. The price fixing of supply quotas aimed to contain “commodity risk” as described above. The negotiated prices are expressed in Euros per unit of electricity. In 2019 new electricity supply and import agreements for Europe ----- were negotiated for 2020, in conjunction with the subsidiaries operating in France and Spain, so that group production organizations use the same supplier. These agreements were negotiated to a small extent at fixed prices in order to benefit from greatly decreasing prices. A sensitivity analysis was not performed on this category of risk because, as at the date of preparing the financial statements, it was not considered material in terms of its impact on the income statement and on the Group’s business margins. _How Commodity Risk is Managed_ The nature of the Group’s business involves exposure to fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas and certain chemical products derived from petroleum (such as latexes) and fibrous raw materials. Natural gas supply contracts are usually agreed at a fixed price and are negotiated at least three months before the supply period, but sometimes for longer periods in relation to the supply period. Electricity is purchased partly at a fixed price, and partially indexed according to the values of continental electricity markets as published by the bodies responsible for these markets. In order to contain possible price pressure on raw materials, the Group aims to diversify its suppliers and its supply markets. Note that at December 31, 2019, the RDM Group had commodity swap agreements. Specifically, in 2018 the subsidiary R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH signed at commodity swap agreement to hedge the purchase of coal, the plant’s main energy source. In 2019 commodity swap agreements were signed by the subsidiary RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. to hedge purchases of gas and sales of energy. There are no other commodity swap agreements. _Liquidity risk_ Liquidity risk can take the form of difficulty in obtaining the funds required to satisfy scheduled contractual commitments at market conditions. This may mean there are insufficient resources available to meet financial obligations under the agreed terms and conditions and at the pre-determined due dates, or it may mean the business is required to settle its financial liabilities earlier than the scheduled due date. For each contract maturity date, the analysis aimed to measure the cash flows deriving from the various types of financial liability held as at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Depending on their nature, financial liabilities were separated into non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities. Given the different accounting treatments, the latter were subdivided into liabilities where the derivative had been formally designated as a hedge, and had turned out to be effective, or liabilities where the derivative was not subject to hedge accounting. The main assumptions relating to the Group’s financial requirements that were used to carry out the analyses were as follows: — cash flows are not discounted; — cash flows are allocated to their respective time bands on the basis of the first possible payment date provided for by the contractual terms and conditions (the worst-case scenario); — all instruments held at the reporting date for which payments have been contractually designated are included; planned future commitments that have not yet been recognized in the financial statements are not included; — if the amount payable is not fixed (e.g., future interest payments), financial liabilities are measured at market terms and conditions at the reporting date; — cash flows also include the interest that the Group will pay up to the due date of the debt, measured at the reporting date and calculated on the basis of market forward interest rates. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The Group’s management policies involve continually monitoring liquidity risk with a view to mitigating said risk by maintaining sufficient liquidity and/or short-term deposits with prime counterparties and by having access to short-term credit facilities backed mainly by receivables from domestic and foreign clients. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The following guidelines are used in pursuing this policy: — inflows and outflows in the same currency are offset (natural hedging); — recourse is made to forward sales or to export loans in the same currency. These transactions were arranged by using a notional amount and due date that correspond to those of the expected cash flows (if the amount is significant), so that any changes in the cash flows arising from the forward transactions, as the result of the appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the other currencies, are substantially offset by a corresponding change in the expected cash flows of the underlying positions; — forward sales are hedged. There were no outstanding transactions of this type at the reporting date. As a general rule, the currency-risk management policy recommends maximizing the use of natural hedging and, in any case, excludes recourse to transactions involving complex derivatives, e.g., those with barriers. The Administration and Finance Department of the Group is responsible for monitoring currency risk and recommends suitable currency-risk hedging strategies to keep exposure within the limits agreed with senior management. _Interest Rate Risk_ Financial liabilities exposing the Group to interest rate risk are, for the most part, floating-rate mediumand long-term loans. The table below sets out the positions that are subject to interest rate risk, separating fixed-rate from floating-rate exposure in terms of the nominal value of the financial instruments.

Cash flow hedges considerably restrict the impact on financial expense recognized in the income statement. _How Interest Rate Risk is Managed_ The Group uses various debt instruments according to the nature of its financial requirements. In particular, it uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and medium- and long-term financing to cover investments in the core business. The techniques used most often are: — advances for short-term requirements; — loans for medium- and long-term requirements. These instruments, which are arranged with leading banks, are mainly indexed to floating rates that are subject to revision every three or six months. The Group’s current risk management policy aims to reduce the variability of the financial expense incurred on its debt and of the related effects on the profit or loss. The practical objectives in terms of risk management therefore involve stabilizing the cash flows linked to the cost of servicing debt in line with budget forecasts. ----- From an operating standpoint, the Group sets about achieving this goal by using derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps (IRS). In line with the features of the transactions carried out and its risk management objectives, the Group has decided to structure its hedging relations using a cash flow hedge approach. Specifically, the hedging relations involve converting floating-rate loan payments to fixed-rate payments. This is carried out by using interest rate swaps (IRS), under which the Group receives a flow of payments from the counterparty bank at the same floating rate as its debt, less the spread. In exchange, the Group makes payments at a fixed rate. The consolidated position (debt + IRS) is therefore a fixed-rate liability of which the amount of financial expense is certain (the aim of cash flow hedging). The present hedging policy excludes the recourse to transactions involving complex derivatives. As at the reporting date, the risk of variability in cash flows linked to floating-rate debt was mainly hedged by derivative financial instruments. _Commodity Risk_ In terms of the nature of the business carried out by RDM Group, commodity risk is the risk that the profit for the year will be reduced by incurring higher costs to purchase raw materials for the mills. This risk is part of the broader category of market risk, specifically where the cost of the raw materials is dependent on changes in a quoted index. In 2017, the Group signed contracts for the supply of natural gas also for 2018, operating mainly on a quarterly and annual basis, negotiating fixed unit prices for each of the individual quarters of supply. This allowed for a significant reduction in “commodity risk”for the first part of the year and a partial reduction for the last quarter. The quotas relating the last quarter were negotiated and confirmed over the year in order to meet the mills’ requirements, while benefiting from the decreasing prices for energy commodities. All prices are expressed in Euros per volume unit, with subsequent adjustments to the content of primary energy contained in it. At the end of November 2017, the Group signed contracts for the supply of electricity at a price indexed according to the prices of certain continental energy markets, in some cases by providing fixing operations following the conclusion of contracts by utilizing appropriate clauses in their contracts. Supply quotas at a price indexed relating to reference markets are negotiated with spreads fixed with respect to these prices. The aim of fixing the supply prices is to contain commodity risk. as described above. The negotiated prices are expressed in Euros per unit of electricity. In 2018 several agreements for the supply of electricity were extended, with part of the excess withdrawals purchased and the deliveries sold agreed at fixed prices for 2019. A sensitivity analysis was not performed on this category of risk because, as at the date of preparing the financial statements, it was not considered material in terms of its impact on the income statement and on the Group’s business margins. _How Commodity Risk is Managed_ The nature of the Group’s business involves exposure to fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas and certain chemical products derived from petroleum (such as latexes) and fibrous raw materials. Natural gas supply contracts are usually agreed for shares of the total requirement and are negotiated at a fixed price at least three months, but sometimes longer, before the supply period. Electricity is purchased at a fixed price, and partially indexed according to the values of continental electricity markets as published by the bodies responsible for these markets. In order to contain possible price pressure on raw materials, the Group aims to diversify its suppliers and its supply markets. A commodity swap was entered into during the year by the subsidiary R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH to hedge purchases of coal, the main energy source of that plant. There are no other derivative contracts on commodities. ----- _Liquidity risk_ Liquidity risk can take the form of difficulty in obtaining the funds required to satisfy scheduled contractual commitments at market conditions. This may mean there are insufficient resources available to meet financial obligations under the agreed terms and conditions and at the pre-determined due dates, or it may mean the business is required to settle its financial liabilities earlier than the scheduled due date. For each contract maturity date, the analysis is aimed at measuring the cash flows deriving from the various types of financial liability held as at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Depending on their nature, financial liabilities were separated into non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities. Given the different accounting treatments, the latter were subdivided into liabilities where the derivative had been formally designated as a hedge, and had turned out to be effective, or liabilities where the derivative was not subject to hedge accounting. The main assumptions relating to the Group’s financial requirements that were used to carry out the analyses were as follows: — cash flows are not discounted; — cash flows are allocated to their respective time bands on the basis of the first possible payment date provided for by the contractual terms and conditions (the worst-case scenario); — all instruments held at the reporting date for which payments have been contractually designated are included; planned future commitments that have not yet been recognized in the financial statements are not included; — if the amount payable is not fixed (e.g., future interest payments), financial liabilities are measured at market terms and conditions at the reporting date; — cash flows also include the interest that the Group will pay up to the due date of the debt, measured at the reporting date and calculated on the basis of market forward interest rates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The RDM Group’s business is divided into two sectors, white lined chipboard (WLC) based on recycled fibers and folding box board (FBB) based on virgin fibers. The reporting used by the directors highlights the results in the two operating segments, WLC, represented by the plants in France, Germany and Spain, and by all the plants operating in Italy, and FBB in which the company RDM La Rochette S.A.S. operates. The Group assesses the performance of its operating segments, both level one and level two, on the basis of gross operating profit, operating profit and the profit/(loss) for the year. Displayed revenues by segment are those earned directly by or attributable to the segment and arising from ordinary operations; they include revenues from transactions with third parties and revenues from transactions with other segments, measured at market prices. Segment costs are the costs of segment operations incurred with third parties and with other operating segments, or those directly attributable to the segment. Costs incurred with other segments are measured at market prices. The economic measure of the results achieved by each operating segment is the profit or loss for the year; within that result, operating profit and gross operating profit are specifically highlighted. As part of the way in which the Group is managed, financial income and expense are continually monitored and measured by the treasury function of the parent company Reno De Medici S.p.A., where, from an operating standpoint, all decisions of a financial nature are also made. There is no need to reconcile the segment valuations contained in this section with the figures included in the financial statements in this report, as all the displayed income components are measured using the same accounting policies adopted for the preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,3263,IMPAIRMENT TESTS,3263.16,,3263.16.1,,"At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to assess whether there are any impairment indicators. If any such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated through an impairment test to determine the write-down amount. The RDM Group has used the procedure described in IAS 36 to identify the cash-generating units representing the smallest identifiable groups of assets which generate cash flows that are largely independent within the consolidated financial statements. The lowest segregation of assets for cash- generating units (CGU) is represented by the individual mills. The recoverability of carrying amounts at this level of aggregation is tested by comparing the net carrying amount of the Net Invested Capital of the individual Cash Generating Units with the value in use represented by the current value of the estimated future cash flows from the continuing use of the assets making up the Cash Generating Units and that of their terminal value. The impairment test relating to the Cash Generating Units (CGU) is carried out from the Asset Side perspective, estimating the operating value or the enterprise value of the CGUs. Note that the scope of the CGUs coincides with an entire legal entity, as in the case of the foreign companies R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH, RDM Blendecques S.A.S., R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S., Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. and the Italian companies R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and PAC Service S.p.A., or with the production plants of Santa Giustina (BL) and Villa Santa Lucia (FR), belonging to the Parent company Reno de Medici S.p.A. It should be noted that as at December 31, 2020 no impairment indicators were identified and therefore the company did not prepare any impairment test. However, against the signing of an option contract for the sale of R.D.M.. La Rochette S.A.S., held through the subsidiary RDM Blendecques S.AS., wrote down some of tangible assets related to the subsidiary subject to options for a total of EUR 3.7 million in order to align its carrying amount using the fair value method deduced from the sale costs. This value represents the best estimate of the directors on the basis of the data that was available on the date of the valuation, including the variable components of the sale price earn out) determined on the higher EBITDA realized in financial years 2021-2023, compared with the reference value. Additionally, an impairment test is conducted annually on the PAC Service S.p.A. CGU as a result of the goodwill of €4.4 million allocated to it at the time of acquisition. Based on the impairment test conducted, no need for any write-down was identified. The main assumptions used by the Group in measuring the recoverable amount (value in use) are: a) estimates of future operating cash flows; b) the discount rate; c) the final growth rate. In making these forecasts, RDM Group used assumptions based on the following key variables: the estimate of future sales volumes, variable costs of energy and packaging, the trend in sales prices, margins, capital expenditure and macroeconomic variables. ----- The Group has used a net rate of 6.04% when discounting cash flows, which reflects current market assessments and also takes into account the specific risks of the sector. During the development of the impairment test, the terminal value was determined by using a growth rate (g rate) of 1.5%. The result of the impairment test, approved by Board of Directors, is based on information currently available and estimates regarding changes in a series of variables. For this reason, based on the recommendations included in Joint Document no. 4 of the Bank of Italy, Consob and ISVAP of March 4, 2010, the Group prepared sensitivity analyses on the results of the tests, basing these on changes in the underlying assumptions (use of the growth rate in calculating the terminal value and discount rate) that affect the value in use of the cash generating units. There has been no need for a write-down following these sensitivity analyses. Moreover, as indicated in the Directors’ Report on Operations, following the spread of Covid-19, that has impacted the national and international scenario since January 2020, further sensitivity analyses on the forecasts of future economic- financial flows and on the main scenarios used to test the capital assets have been made. Based on these analyses, any elements have not been identified that could constitute an impairment of cash generating units. Considering that recoverable amounts are calculated on the basis of estimates of future growth, the Group cannot be certain that a revision of these estimates, and the resulting adjustment to values, will not be required. The Group will continually monitor the changing situation in order to make any necessary revision to the assumptions underlying the estimates. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

This item recorded a decrease of EUR 31 million, basically due to the reduction in the average cost of both recycled and virgin fibers. As regards the main factors of production, the price of scrap paper, after strong price decreases in the previous two years, has made a further sensible decrease at the beginning of 2020. This decrease reversed starting from mid-March as a result of a decrease in supply resulting from lower city collections as a result of the Covid-19 emergency. A new downward trend was, however, recorded starting in July. It was not until the last quarter of 2020 that a new increase in prices occurred, supported by an increased demand coming primarily from the containerboard sector. On the other hand, the price of virgin cellulosic fibers, after peaking in fiscal 2018 and then falling sharply in 2019, has been stable. Costs for services show a decrease of EUR 18.4 million basically due to the reduction in the purchase prices of the Group’s main energy supply sources, namely natural gas, electricity and coal, a reduction that had already begun in 2019. As last year, in 2020 the positive effect resulting from price dynamics was mitigated by medium-term purchase agreements concluded by the Group. “Costs for use of third-party assets”at December 31, 2020 amount to EUR 2 million, in line with the one from the previous year,",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The Group’s only derivative instruments indexed to interest rates are interest rate swaps. A discounted cash flow model is used to measure these instruments, whereby the fair value of a derivative is given by the algebraic sum of the present values of future cash flows estimated on the basis of the risk-free curve of deposit rates, futures and swaps at the reporting date. In addition, a number of commodity swap contracts are in place. In particular: - the subsidiary company R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH has signed a Commodity Swap contract to hedge purchases of coal, the main energy source of that plant. - the subsidiary RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. signed commodity swap contracts to hedge purchases of gas and sales of energy. In spite of these agreements having been concluded for hedging purposes, they were not recorded under hedge accounting. ----- The reference international accounting standard (IFRS 13) identifies a measurement hierarchy based on three levels: - level 1: inputs used in measurements are represented by quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities to those subject to measurement; - level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or liability, both directly (prices) and indirectly (derived from prices); - level 3: in the event that observable inputs are not available, and therefore market activity is light or nonexistent for the asset or liability subject to measurement, the inputs are non-observable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The following guidelines are used in pursuing this policy: - inflows and outflows in the same currency are offset (natural hedging); - recourse is made to forward sales or to export loans in the same currency. These transactions were arranged by using a notional amount and due date that correspond to those of the expected cash flows (if the amount is significant), so that any changes in the cash flows arising from the forward transactions, as the result of the appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the other currencies, are substantially offset by a corresponding change in the expected cash flows of the underlying positions; - forward sales are hedged. There were no outstanding transactions of this type at the reporting date. As a general rule, the currency-risk management policy recommends maximizing the use of natural hedging and, in any case, excludes recourse to transactions involving complex derivatives, e.g., those with barriers. The Administration and Finance Department of the Group is responsible for monitoring currency risk and recommends suitable currency-risk hedging strategies to keep exposure within the limits agreed with senior management.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,447,MARKET RISK,447.18,How Interest Rate Risk is managed,447.18.1,,"The Group uses various debt instruments according to the nature of its financial requirements. In particular, it uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and medium- and long-term financing to cover investments in the core business. The techniques used most often are: - advances for short-term requirements; - loans for medium- and long-term requirements. These instruments, which are arranged with leading banks, are mainly indexed to floating rates that are subject to revision every three or six months. The Group’s current risk management policy aims to reduce the variability of the financial expense incurred on its debt and of the related effects on the profit or loss. The practical objectives in terms of risk management therefore involve stabilizing the cash flows linked to the cost of servicing debt in line with budget forecasts. From an operating standpoint, the Group sets about achieving this goal by using derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps (IRS). In line with the features of the transactions carried out and its risk management objectives, the Group has decided to structure its hedging relations using a cash flow hedge approach. Specifically, the hedging relations involve converting floating-rate loan payments to fixed- rate payments. This is carried out by using interest rate swaps (IRS), under which the Group receives a flow of payments from the counterparty bank at the same floating rate as its debt, less the spread. In exchange, the Group makes a payment flow at a fixed rate. The consolidated position (debt + IRS) is therefore a fixed-rate liability of which the amount of financial expense is certain (the aim of cash flow hedging). ----- The present hedging policy excludes the recourse to transactions involving complex derivatives. As at the reporting date, the risk of variability in cash flows linked to floating-rate debt was mainly hedged by derivative financial instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,447,MARKET RISK,447.19,Commodity risk,447.19.1,,"In terms of the nature of the business carried out by RDM Group, commodity risk is the risk that the profit for the year will be reduced by incurring higher costs to purchase raw materials for the mills. This risk is part of the broader category of market risk, specifically where the cost of the raw material is dependent on changes in a quoted index. During the two-year period 2018-2019, the Group signed contracts for the supply of natural gas that also included 2020, operating mainly on a quarterly and annual basis, negotiating fixed unit prices for each of the subsequent annual and quarterly supply periods. The method enabled a significant reduction in price volatility (“commodity risk”), also allowing the Group, during the second half-year, to benefit from a general decline in energy prices. The quotas relating the last two quarters of 2020 were negotiated and confirmed over the year in order to meet the mills’ requirements, while benefiting from the decreasing energy prices. All prices of natural gas, the Group’s main energy commodity, are expressed in Euros per volume unit, with subsequent adjustments to the content of primary energy contained in it. At the end of June 2019, the Group signed contracts for the supply of electricity for 2020 at a price indexed according to the prices of certain continental energy markets, in some cases by providing options for fixing transactions following the conclusion of contracts. Supply quotas at a price indexed relating to reference markets are negotiated with spreads fixed with respect to these prices. The options for fixing prices of supply quotas were aimed at containing the “commodity risk” in some particularly volatile regional markets such as the Spanish and French markets. The negotiated prices are expressed in Euros per unit of electricity. In 2020, new electricity supply (or of supply for export) agreements for Europe were negotiated for 2021, in conjunction with the subsidiaries operating in France and Spain. The group production entities use the same supplier, except the German subsidiary. In the regions with a lower risk of volatility, only a minor portion of the contracts were negotiated at a fixed price, in order to benefit from the strong downward trend already underway even before the events related to the health emergency. A sensitivity analysis was not performed on this category of risk because, as at the date of preparing the financial statements, it was not considered material in terms of its impact on the income statement and on the Group’s business margins.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,447,MARKET RISK,447.20,How Commodity Risk is managed,447.20.1,,"The nature of the Group’s business involves exposure to fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas and certain chemical products derived from petroleum (such as latexes) and fibrous raw materials. Natural gas supply contracts are usually agreed for total requirements at a fixed price and are negotiated at least three months before the supply period, but sometimes for longer periods in relation to the supply period. Electricity is purchased partly at a fixed price, and partially indexed according to the values of continental electricity markets as published by the bodies responsible for these markets. In order to contain possible price pressure on raw materials, the Group aims to diversify its suppliers and its supply markets. Note that at December 31, 2020, the RDM Group had commodity swap agreements. Specifically, in 2018 the subsidiary R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH signed a commodity swap agreement to hedge the purchase of coal, the plant’s main energy source. In 2020 commodity swap agreements were signed by the subsidiary RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. to hedge purchases of gas and sales of energy. There are no other commodity swap agreements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

This may mean there are insufficient resources available to meet financial obligations under the agreed terms and conditions and at the pre- determined due dates, or it may mean the business is required to settle its financial liabilities earlier than the scheduled due date. For each contract maturity date, the analysis aimed to measure the cash flows deriving from the various types of financial liability held as at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Depending on their nature, financial liabilities were separated into non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities. Given the different accounting treatments, the latter were subdivided into liabilities where the derivative had been formally designated as a hedge, and had turned out to be effective, or liabilities where the derivative was not subject to hedge accounting. The main assumptions relating to the Group’s financial requirements that were used to carry out the analyses were as follows: - cash flows are not discounted; - cash flows are allocated to their respective time bands on the basis of the first possible payment date provided for by the contractual terms and conditions (the worst-case scenario); - all instruments held at the reporting date for which payments have been contractually designated are included; planned future commitments that have not yet been recognized in the financial statements are not included; - if the amount payable is not fixed (e.g., future interest payments), financial liabilities are measured at market terms and conditions at the reporting date; - cash flows also include the interest that the Group will pay up to the due date of the debt, measured at the reporting date and calculated on the basis of market forward interest rates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The offer includes also a variable price “earnout” component on higher EBITDA realized, as compared with the reference one, in the next three years. The offer also provides that at the date of closing the final price will be adjusted on the basis of variations of the financial position and of the working capital with respect to the values set between the parties.

In order to assess the recoverable amount of tangible assets of the CGU RDM La Rochette S.A.S., it was necessary to use the method of fair value less costs of disposal that the Directors determined on the basis of the sale contract of the subsidiary R.D.M.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. ----- We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence applicable in Italy, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report. Other information communicated pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Regulation 537/2014 The Shareholders’ Meeting of Reno De Medici S.p.A. has appointed us on April 27, 2012 as auditors of the Company for the years from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2020. We declare that we have not provided prohibited non-audit services referred to in Art. 5 (1) of EU Regulation 537/2014 and that we have remained independent of the Company in conducting the audit. We confirm that the opinion on the financial statements expressed in this report is consistent with the additional report to the Board of Statutory Auditors, in its role of Audit Committee, referred to in Art. 11 of the said Regulation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The RDM Group operates mainly in Europe and the business of the Group is the production and distribution of carton board for packaging made from both recycled fibers and virgin fibers. Distribution and sale operations are carried out through a network of agents and the internal sales force under the subsidiary R.D.M Marketing Group. Reno De Medici S.p.A. has its registered office in Milan, Italy. The shares of the Parent company Reno De Medici S.p.A. are listed on the Star segment of Borsa Italiana S.p.A. and on the Madrid stock exchange. The consolidated financial statements of the RDM Group were approved and authorized for publication by the Board of Directors of Reno De Medici S.p.A. on March 16, 2020. The consolidated financial statements of the RDM Group are presented in Euros (rounded to the nearest thousand), as this is the prevailing currency in the countries where the Group carries out most of its activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the principles described in the section “Accounting Principles”. The 2019 consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and approved by the European Union, and on the basis of provisions issued to implement Article 9 of Legislative Decree 38/205. IFRS also includes all revised international accounting standards (“IAS”), all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”), including those previously issued by the Standing Interpretations Committee (“SIC”).",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1728,REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,1728.26,"In compliance with the Annual Financial Report as at December 31, 2018, the RDM Group applied the same accounting principles with the exception of IFRS 16 which came into force from January 1, 2019. In particular:",1728.26.1,,"- IFRS 16 – Leases: adopted by the Group from January 1, 2019. The new principle establishes a single model for recognizing and valuing lease agreements for the tenant, no longer distinguishing between operating and financial leases and, specifically, for contracts where it is applicable, a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability is recorded in financial statements. The Group has chosen to apply the amended retrospective principle without any change to the comparative data. Specifically, for lease agreements previously classified as operating leases, the Group entered into the accounts: a) a financial liability, equal to the current value of the remaining future payments at the date of transition, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate applicable at the date of transition for each contract; b) a right of use equal to the value of the financial liability at the date of transition. The Group decided to calculate the right of use equal to the net book value that it would have had if the principle had been applied from the starting date of the contract, however, using the discount rate defined at the date of transition. In adopting IFRS 16, the Group used the exemption granted in paragraph IFRS 16:5(a) in relation to short-term leases for all asset classes with the exception of buildings. Similarly, the Group used the exemption granted in paragraph IFRS 16:5(b) as far as lease agreements for which the underlying asset is a low-value asset are concerned (namely, the lease agreement underlying assets do not exceed €5,000 when new). The contracts for which the exemption was applied mainly fall under the following categories: - Computers and telephones; - Printers. ----- For these contracts the introduction of IFRS 16 did not involve the recording of the financial assets of the lease and the related right of use, but the rental income was recorded in the income statement on a straightline basis for the duration of the respective contracts. The Group used the following practical arrangements set out in IFRS 16: - Separation of the non-lease components: The Group used the exemption granted by paragraph IFRS 16:15 for all asset categories except buildings. The non-lease components of these assets were not split off and entered into the accounts separately from the lease components, but were considered together with the latter in calculating the financial liability of the lease and the related right of use. - Portfolio approach: the Group identified contracts with similar characteristics that can be dealt with as a portfolio for the asset category “forklifts (Plant and machinery)”. Overall, as at December 31, 2019, the application of the new principle involved: - the accounting of a total of €12.4 million under rights of use for tangible and intangible assets; - the accounting of a financial liability of around €12.5 million; - with reference to the income statement, rental income of €3.4 million was reversed and increased amortization and depreciation of €3.3 million was recorded and increased financial expense of €517 thousand. The impacts on the EBITDA, operating profit (EBIT) and net profit (loss) of the Group in the period stand, respectively, +€3.4 million, +€130 thousand and -€387 thousand; - the net financial position worsened to €12.5 million.

More complex matters and/or those that require greater use of assumptions and estimates are discussed in the section “Estimates and Valuations”.

The definition of control is not based solely on the concept of legal ownership. According to IFRS 10, the definition of control is based on three elements: (a) power over the business purchased; (b) exposure or rights, at variable returns resulting from involvement with the latter; (c) capacity to utilize the power to influence the amount of these returns. IFRS 10 stipulates that in order to evaluate whether it has control over the acquired business, an investor should focus only on activities that materially affect returns and rights which are substantial, i.e., can be exercised in practice when important decisions have to be taken with regard to the acquired business. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is acquired until the date that such control ceases to exist. The portions of shareholders’ equity and profit or loss attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated income statement, and consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The main consolidation principles adopted are as follows: - the carrying amount of each investment consolidated on a line-by-line basis is eliminated against the related equity, with the assets, liabilities, income and expense of the subsidiary being added to those of the Parent company, regardless of the size of the investment; the shares of subsidiaries’ capital and reserves and of subsidiaries’ profit or loss attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement; - the acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method as provided for by IFRS 3 (Revised) (see “Business Combinations”); - all balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated, as are any profits and losses (unless losses indicate an impairment of the sold asset requiring recognition) arising from commercial or financial intragroup transactions not yet realized with third parties; - any increases or decreases in a subsidiary’s equity arising from its post-acquisition results are recorded upon elimination in the “Retained earnings (losses)” equity reserve; - dividends distributed by Group companies were eliminated from the income statement upon consolidation; - In the event of loss of control, the Group will eliminate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any third-party interests, and the other components of equity relative to the subsidiaries. The profit or loss from the loss of control will be recognized in the profit or loss for the year. Any equity interest maintained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value on the date that control is lost. Measurement will subsequently be through the equity method.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Under this method, the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in the income statement at the time they are incurred. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value as at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase gain. At the acquisition date, non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice between the two methods is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Any contingent consideration arrangement in the business combination is measured at its acquisitiondate fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination in order to determine goodwill. Subsequent changes in the fair value are recognized in the income statement. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Cost is reduced by accumulated depreciation and any impairment. Costs for improvements, modernization and transformation incurred after the initial recognition of the asset acquired or produced internally are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across their useful life, provided they derive from separate analytical accounting measurements and when it is probable that the future economic benefits expected from the asset will increase. Replacement costs of identifiable components of complex assets are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across their useful life. The residual value of the replaced component is ascribed to the income statement. Maintenance and repair costs are ascribed to the income statement in the year they are incurred. Assets assumed through financial lease agreements, for which all the risks and benefits related to ownership are substantially transferred to the Group, are recorded under tangible assets at their current value or, if lower, the current value of the minimum payments due for the lease. A corresponding financial liability representing financial debt due to the lessor is recorded in financial statements. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of assets, determined on the basis of the period during which the asset will be used by the Group.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,3283,VALUATION METHODS,3283.3,Impairment tests,3283.3.1,,"At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to assess whether there are any impairment indicators. If any such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated to determine the write-down amount. The RDM Group conducts impairment testing at least once a year, taking into consideration several impairment indicators identified within the actual Group at the level of individual assets and/or related to the economic and financial performance of certain CGUs. In view of the changed conditions in the FBB sector in which the French subsidiary R.D.M. La Rochette operates, a sector which has, in recent years, seen a large increase in production capacity and, as a result, the quality of the products, which has greatly reduced the Group’s competitiveness in the sector, it was decided to estimate the market value of the amortized assets of R.D.M. La Rochette. Based on the results in the appraisal prepared by an independent expert, some fixed assets were written down by a total value of €9.5 million. The RDM Group has used the procedure described in IAS 36 to identify the cash-generating units representing the smallest identifiable groups of assets which generate cash flows that are largely independent within the consolidated financial statements. The lowest segregation of assets for cash-generating units is represented by the individual mills. The recoverability of carrying amounts at this level of aggregation is tested by comparing the net carrying amount of the Net Invested Capital of the individual Cash Generating Units with the value in use represented by the current value of the estimated future cash flows from the continuing use of the assets making up the Cash Generating Units and that of their terminal value. The impairment test relating to the Cash Generating Units (CGU) is carried out from the Asset Side perspective, estimating the operating value or the enterprise value of the CGUs. Note that the scope of the CGUs coincides with an entire legal entity, as in the case of the foreign companies R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH, RDM Blendecques S.A.S., R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S., RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. and the Italian companies R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and PAC Service S.p.A., or with the production plants of Santa Giustina (BL) and Villa Santa Lucia (FR), belonging to the Parent company Reno de Medici S.p.A. An impairment test is conducted annually on the CGU of PAC Service S.p.A., as a result of the goodwill of €4.4 million allocated to it at the time of acquisition. Based on the impairment test conducted, no need for any write-down was identified. The main assumptions used by the Group in measuring the recoverable amount (value in use) are: ----- a) estimates of future operating cash flows; b) the discount rate; c) the final growth rate. In making these forecasts, RDM Group used assumptions based on the following key variables: the estimate of future sales volumes, variable costs of energy and packaging, the trend in sales prices, margins, capital expenditure and macroeconomic variables. The Group has used a net rate of 6.72% when discounting cash flows, which reflects current market assessments and also takes into account the specific risks of the sector. During the development of the impairment test, the terminal value was determined by using a growth rate (g rate) of 1.5%. The result of the impairment test, approved by Board of Directors, is based on information currently available and estimates regarding changes in a series of variables. For this reason, based on the recommendations included in Joint Document no. 4 of the Bank of Italy, Consob and ISVAP of March 4, 2010, the Group prepared sensitivity analyses on the results of the tests, basing these on changes in the underlying assumptions (use of the growth rate in calculating the terminal value and discount rate) that affect the value in use of the cash generating units. There has been no need for a write-down following these sensitivity analyses. Moreover, as indicated in the Directors’ Report on Operations, following the spread of Covid-19 (Coronavirus), that has impacted the national and international scenario since January 2020, further sensitivity analyses on the forecasts of future economic-financial flows and on the main scenarios used to test the capital assets have been made. Based on these analyses, any elements have not been identified that could constitute an impairment of cash generating unit. Considering that recoverable amounts are calculated on the basis of estimates of future growth, the Group cannot be certain that a revision of these estimates, and the resulting adjustment to values, will not be required. The Group will continually monitor the changing situation in order to make any necessary revision to the assumptions underlying the estimates. ----- At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to assess whether there are any impairment indicators. If any such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of such assets is estimated to determine the write-down amount. At least once a year, the RDM Group carries out impairment testing taking into consideration several impairment indicators measured in the actual Group and linked to the economic and financial performance of some CGUs. Also note that from 2018 onwards the goodwill figures were allocated to the two new CGUs: Pac Service S.p.A. (€4.3 million) and Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. (€0.5 million). The RDM Group has used the procedure described in IAS 36 to identify the cash-generating units representing the smallest identifiable groups of assets which generate cash flows that are largely independent within the consolidated financial statements. The lowest aggregation of assets for cash-generating units is represented by the individual mills. The recoverability of carrying amounts is tested by comparing the net carrying amount of the Net Invested Capital of the individual cash-generating units with the value of use represented by the current value of the estimated future cash flows from the continuing use of the assets making up the cash-generating units and that of their terminal value. The impairment test relating to the Cash Generating Units (CGU) is carried out from the Asset Side perspective, estimating the operating value or the enterprise value of the CGUs. Note that the scope of the CGUs corresponds to a complete legal entity, as in the case of foreign companies R.D.M. Arnsberg GmbH, RDM Blendecques S.A.S., R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S., Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. and the Italian companies R.D.M. Ovaro S.p.A. and PAC Service S.p.A., or the mills of Santa Giustina (BL) and Villa Santa Lucia (FR) belonging to the Parent Company Reno de Medici S.p.A. The main assumptions used by the Group in measuring the recoverable amount (value in use) are: a) estimates of future operating cash flows; b) the discount rate; c) the final growth rate. In making these forecasts, RDM Group used assumptions based on the following key variables: the estimate of future sales volumes, the trend in sales prices, the variable costs of fibrous and chemical materials, margins, capital expenditures and macroeconomic variables. The Group has used the same net rate, 6.74%, for all cash-generating units when discounting cash flows, a rate which reflects current market assessments and also takes into account the specific risks of the sector. During the development of the impairment test, the terminal value was determined by using a growth rate (g rate) of 1.5%. Based on the impairment tests, approved by the Board of Directors, no need for impairment emerged. With reference to the Magenta area, in order to determine the recoverability of the assets relating to the Non-operating-Mill of Magenta, it was used the fair value less costs to sell method of the land and buildings (current market value) instead of value in use, and this was determined based on the preliminary contract, signed in November 2018, which relates the sale of the entire area. Note that, in the light of several suspensive conditions and clauses provided for in the above-mentioned agreement, this sale cannot be considered realized at the date of the financial statements and the related assets were not classified as held for sale. The result of the impairment test is based on information currently available and estimates regarding changes in a series of variables. For this reason, based on the recommendations included in Joint Document no. 4 of the Bank of Italy, Consob and ISVAP of March 4, 2010, the Group prepared sensitivity analyses on the results of the tests, basing these on changes in the underlying assumptions (use of the growth rate in calculating the terminal value and discount rate) that affect the value in use of the cash generating units. The sensitivity analyses showed that: ----- - A decrease of 0.5 percentage points in the above-mentioned variables compared with the “base case” would not cause any impairment; - A scenario (which at the present time is not foreseeable) involving a simultaneous increase in the WACC to a level greater than 7% — a value that has not been employed in the last five years — and a reduction in the “g rate” to below the rate of inflation would cause limited impairment of about €0.6 million of the assets related to the CGU of RDM Blendecques and about €0.6 million of the assets related to the CGU of R.D.M. La Rochette S.A.S. Considering that recoverable amounts are calculated on the basis of estimates of future growth, the Group cannot be certain that a revision of these estimates, and the resulting adjustment to values, will not be required. The Group will continually monitor the changing situation in order to make any necessary revision to the assumptions underlying the estimates. Business plans were thus amended for the impairment testing of cash-generating units, in order to take account of the current economic and financial situation and of the uncertainties weighing on all the main variables of the business. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Specifically, the harmonization of the product characteristics from a multi mill perspective, which allows a better optimization of the product portfolio/ geographical mix, has given prominence to the division of corporate performance into the two segments, WLC (white lined chipboard — coated board made of recycled fibers) and FBB (folding box board based on virgin fibers). The following segment information has been prepared in the light of the new strategy described above. The reporting used by the directors highlights the results in the two operating segments, WLC, represented by the plants in France, Germany and Spain, which became part of the Group on October 31, 2018, and by all the plants operating in Italy, and FBB in which the company RDM La Rochette S.A.S. operates. The Group assesses the performance of its operating segments, both level one and level two, on the basis of gross operating profit, operating profit and the profit/(loss) for the year. Displayed revenues by segment are those earned directly by or attributable to the segment and arising from ordinary operations; they include revenues from transactions with third parties and revenues from transactions with other segments, measured at market prices. Segment costs are the costs of segment operations incurred with third parties and with other operating segments, or those directly attributable to the segment. Costs incurred with other segments are measured at market prices. The economic measure of the results achieved by each operating segment is the profit or loss for the year; within that result, operating profit and gross operating profit are specifically highlighted. As part of the way in which the Group is managed, financial income and expense are continually monitored and measured by the treasury function of the parent company Reno De Medici S.p.A., where, from an operating standpoint, all decisions of a financial nature are also made. There is no need to reconcile the segment valuations contained in this section with the figures included in the financial statements in this report, as all the displayed income components are measured using the same accounting policies adopted for the preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Unallocated items and adjustments include intersegment balances relating to intercompany transactions and the effects of discontinued operations.

Revenues of the RDM Group reached €701.6 million in 2019. The increase of €95.6 million compared with the previous year is essentially due to the fact that RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. was consolidated from October 31, 2018 and therefore at December 31, 2018 only the revenue relating to the last two months of the year was consolidated. Excluding the consolidation of RDM Barcelona Cartonboard (+€110.9 million), Group revenues decreased compared with the previous year by €15.3 million. The reduction is due both to a fall in sales prices in the WLC segment concentrated in the second part of the year and to a reduction in volumes in the FBB segment.

The item increased by €23.5 million due essentially to the different scope of consolidation of RDM Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. where, as it was consolidated from October 31, 2018, the financial statements at December 31, 2018 only included the costs for the last two months. Excluding this effect, standing at €40 million, the cost of raw materials fell following a reduction in the price of waste paper and, especially, virgin fibers. As far as the performance of the main production factors is concerned, following the substantial decreases in the price of recycled fibers in 2018, they suffered further reductions in 2019. On the other hand, the price of virgin cellulose fibers fell considerably in 2019 compared with the levels reached at the end of 2018. ----- Service costs increased by €52.4 million. This increase was essentially due, on the one side to the different scope of consolidation, which resulted in an increase in costs of €49.5 million and, on the other hand, to increased costs for waste disposal related to the increase in prices. With regard to energy components, the prices of natural gas and coal, the main energy sources of the RDM Group, fell significantly compared with the previous year. The positive effect resulting from price dynamics was mitigated by medium-term purchase agreements concluded the previous year. “Costs for use of third-party assets”at December 31, 2019 fell compared with the previous year, standing at €1.9 million. This reduction was exclusively due to the introduction, from January 1, 2019, of IFRS 16 according to which costs for rentals and leases should be capitalized and recorded in the income statement based on the depreciation method.

Given the period in which the expected benefits were estimated, the useful life was calculated as 10 years. - increase of “asset under construction”is due to the project to implement the new ERP, which started in 2016, equal to €1 million. “Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life”refer to the valuation of concessions granted in Germany in relation to water rights with an indefinite useful life. At the date of the financial statements, the Group conducted the impairment test, in accordance with the IAS 36, and accounted for an impearment loss of €830 thousand. ----- More information are reported in the paragraph “Impairment Tests”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The caption decreased slightly, standing at €827 thousand, due essentially to the combined effect of the difference scope of consolidation (+€20 million) on the one side and of the fall in the cost of raw materials on the other side. As far as the performance of the main production factors is concerned, in 2018 the price of recycled fibers fell considerably from September 2017 and continued to do so throughout the first quarter of 2018, reaching the lowest level recorded by the market since the 2009 crisis in March. Average prices then stabilized in subsequent quarters. On the other hand, the price of virgin cellulose fibers in 2018 continued to rise, both in the so-called short fibers segment and the long fibers segment. Service costs increased by €21.7 million. This increase was essentially due on the one side to the different scope of consolidation which caused an overall increase in costs of €11.9 million and, on the other side, to higher energy costs of €8.8 million. With regard to energy components, the unit price of natural gas, which is the main source of energy for the RDM Group, increased significantly compared with the previous year. There was also an increase in the price of coal, which is the main fuel used at the Arnsberg mill. “Costs for the use of third-party assets” as at December 31, 2018 increased to €453 thousand, compared with the previous year; this increase was essentially due to the increase in plant and machinery rental and leasing costs.

These events — extraordinary in nature and scale — are generating direct and indirect effects on the economy and have triggered a general uncertain context, whose development and the related consequences are not predictable. The potential effects that this phenomenon can have on financial results cannot be estimated at the moment and will be constantly monitored in the coming months. Said so, according to the Government’s Decree of March 22, 2020, the operations of RDM Group are regularly running, given the essentiality of products supplied to the food and pharma packaging, and being used to protect goods in online distributions, resulting in a profitability that remains in line with the average of the Group. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses on the forecasts of future economic-financial flows and on the main scenarios used to test the Group’s assets have not identified elements that could constitute an impairment loss. In addition, the analysis of the liquidity over the next 12 months, has not identified elements that could mine the going concern of the Group. ----- No significant events took place after the year-end. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

As required by the “IAS 36 Impairment of Assets”, the Directors, noting impairment indicators for the CGU RDM La Rochette S.A.S., have carried out the impairment test in order to determine that tangible assets are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2019 at a value not higher than the recoverable value. In order to assess the recoverable amount of tangible assets of the CGU RDM La Rochette S.A.S., which correspond to the subsidiary RDM La Rochette S.A.S., it was necessary to use the method of fair value less costs of disposal that the Directors determined through the assessment carried out with the support of an independent expert. In particular, the recoverable amount of tangible assets was estimated with the “market approach” method. Based on the impairment test approved by the Board of Directors, the Group accounted for an impairment loss of tangible assets for Euro 9.5 million. Considering the relevance of the amount of tangible assets recorded in the financial statements, the nature of the assessment process adopted by the independent expert, and the need to be supported by our experts, we considered the impairment test of the CGU RDM La Rochette S.A.S. a key audit matter of the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The “Impairment test” paragraph of the consolidated financial statements states the disclosures related to the impairment test on tangible assets performed by the Directors. Audit procedures** As part of our audit, we have, among others, carried out the following procedures, also performed** with the support of experts of Deloitte’s network: - Assessment of the procedures used to determine the fair value of tangible assets of the CGU La Rochette S.A.S., analyzing methods and assumptions considered in the independent expert’s appraisal, - Understand the Company’s relevant internal controls on the impairment test process; - Evaluation of the competences, capabilities and objectivity of the expert involved by the Directors to prepare the appraisal; - Analysis of the reasonableness of the main assumptions used for the appraisal; - Assessment of the accuracy of data used by the expert to determine the fair value; - Review of the correct calculation of the book value of the CGU. Further, we also examined the adequacy and compliance of the disclosure provided by the Company on the impairment test based on IAS 36 disclosure requirements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

As required by the “IAS 36 Impairment of Assets”, the Directors, have carried out the impairment test in order to determine that the goodwill is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2019 at a value not higher than the recoverable value. The recoverable amount of the abovementioned goodwill was determined using the value in use, based on estimates of cash flows generated by the asset. In particular, the Directors referred to the cash-generating unit (CGU), which correspond to the subsidiary Pac Service S.p.A. The valuation process is complex and based on assumptions concerning, among others, the forecast of expected cash flows of the CGU Pac Service S.p.A., resulting from the plan used for the purposes of the impairment test, and the determination of an appropriate discount rate (WACC) and growth rate (g-rate). In determining cash flow forecasts, the most relevant variables are the estimate of future sales volumes, the expected sales price trend, the variable costs of packing and energy, margins, capital expenditures and other macroeconomic variables. Future expectations and market conditions influence these assumptions. Based on the impairment test approved by the Board of Directors, the Group has not recognized any impairment loss. Considering the relevance of the amount of goodwill in the financial statements, the subjectivity of the estimates relating to the determination of cash flows (DCF) and the key variables of the impairment model, we considered the impairment test a key audit matter of the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The “Impairment test” paragraph of the consolidated financial statements states the disclosures related to the impairment test, including a sensitivity analysis performed by the Directors, which shows the effects that may occur on the recoverable amount of the assets resulting from the changes in certain key assumptions used for the impairment test. Audit procedures** Preliminarily, we have examined how the Directors determine the value in use of the performed** CGUs by analyzing the methods and assumptions used and considered for the development of the impairment test. As part of our audit, we have, among others, carried out the following procedures, also with the support of experts of Deloitte’s network: - understand the Company’s relevant internal controls on the impairment test process; - analysis of the reasonableness of the key assumptions underlying the cash flow calculation; also, through information obtained from the Management; - analysis of the actual figures compared to the plans in order to assess the nature of the deviations and the reliability of the planning process; - assessment of the reasonableness of the discount rate (WACC) and growth rate (grate); - review of the mathematical accuracy of the model used to estimate the value in use of the CGUs; - review of the correct calculation of the book value of the CGUs; - review of the Directors’ sensitivity analysis. Further, we also examined the adequacy and compliance of the disclosure provided by the Company on the impairment test based on IAS 36 disclosure requirements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. ----- We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.

In particular:",3285.34.1,,"- IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” came into effect from January 1, 2018. The adoption of this principle had no effect on the financial statements; - IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”: this standard replaced IAS 39 with effect from the financial years beginning January 1, 2018 and (i) amended the classification and evaluation model of financial assets basing it on the characteristics of the financial instrument and the business model adopted by the company which, for the RDM Group, is the Held-to-collect and sell model; (ii) introduced a new write-down method for financial assets which takes expected losses into account (“expected credit losses”); and (iii) amended the provisions with regard to hedge accounting.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The application of the new requirements introduced through IFRS 9 for the classification of equity investments led the Group to analyze the requirements of the agreements relating to the company Consortile Paper Interconnector. Following the analysis conducted and taking into consideration the value of the electricity purchase contract related to the investment made, the equity investment was reclassified under the item Intangible Fixed Assets. Taking into consideration the Group’s business model, trade receivables were classified in the “held-tocollect” and “held -to-collect and sell” categories which involve the measurement at fair value offset with the other components of the comprehensive income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

This principle is intended to replace IAS 17 — Leases as well as IFRIC 4 — Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, SIC-15 — Operating Leases — Incentives and SIC-27 — Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The new principle redefines the lease and introduces a control (right-of-use) criterion to distinguish leases from service agreements. The principle will apply from January 1, 2019 but early application is permitted. The Company completed the preliminary assessment project of the potential impacts resulting from the application of the new principle at the transition date (January 1, 2019). This process was broken down into various phases, including the full mapping of contracts potentially suitable to contain a lease and their analysis in order to understand the main clauses significant for the purpose of IFRS 16. The implementation process of the principle is in the process of being completed, which involves the setting of an IT infrastructure aimed at the accounting management of the principle and the alignment of the administrative processes and monitoring of the critical areas that the principle focuses on. This process is expected to be completed in early 2019. The Company decided to apply the amended principle retrospectively. Specifically, with regard to lease agreements previously classified as operating, the Company will record: a) a financial liability, equal to the current value of remaining future payments at the date of transition, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate applicable at the date of transition for each agreement; b) a right of use equal to the value of the financial liability at the date of transition. The Company decided to calculate the right of use equal to the net book value that it would have had if the principle had been applied from the start date of the contract using, however, the discount rate defined at the date of transition. For these contracts, the amount of the right of use and the financial liability was estimated at €5 million. In adopting IFRS 16, the Company intends to avail itself of the exemption granted by paragraph IFRS 16 5 (a) with regard to short-term leases for all classes of assets except for buildings. ----- Similarly, the Company intends to avail itself of the exemption granted by IFRS 16 5 (b) as far as lease agreements for which the underlying asset is a low-value asset are concerned (in other words the assets underlying the lease agreement are not worth more than €5,000 when new). The contracts for which the exemption was applied mainly fall into the following categories: - Computers and telephones; - Printers. For these contracts the introduction of IFRS 16 will not involve the recognition of the financial liability of the lease and the related right of use, but the rent will be reported in the income statement on a linear basis for the duration of the respective agreements. The Company intends to use the following practical devices provided for by IFRS 16: - Separation of non-lease components: the Company intends to avail itself of the exemption granted by IFRS 16 15 for all categories of assets with the exception of buildings. The non-lease components of these assets will not be spun off and recorded separately from the lease components, but they will be considered together with the latter in calculating the financial liabilities of the lease and the related right of use. - Portfolio approach: the Company has identified contracts with similar characteristics which can be treated as a portfolio for the following category of assets: - Fork-lift trucks (Plant and machinery) - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation — Amendment to IFRS 9; As at the date of this Annual Financial Report, the competent bodies of the European Union had not yet completed the approval process required for the adoption of the following accounting standards and amendments: - IFRS 17 — Insurance Contracts, which is intended to replace IFRS 4 — Insurance Contracts; - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures — Amendment to IAS 28; - Amendment to IFRS 3 “Definition of a Business”; - Amendment to IAS 19 “Plant Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement”; - Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture — Amendment to IFRS 10 and IAS 28; - The document “Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2015-2017 Cycle”which includes the changes to some principles under the scope of the annual improvement process. - Definition of Materials Document (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8). This document introduced a change to the definition of “significant” in standard IAS 1. The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets held for sale, which are recognized at fair value, and financial liabilities, which are recognized at amortized cost. The carrying amount of hedged assets and liabilities which are qualified for hedge accounting is adjusted to take into account changes in the fair value due to hedged risks. The financial statements were prepared with clarity and truthfully and accurately represent the RDM Group’s results, assets and liabilities, and cash flows. The financial statements were prepared on the goingconcern assumption. The Directors considered it appropriate to assume the business was a going-concern because, in their judgment, no uncertainties have emerged relating to events or circumstances which, taken into consideration individually or as a whole, could give rise to doubts concerning business continuity. Preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS may require the use of specific estimates and valuations, as well as management’s reasonable judgment in applying accounting policies. More complex matters and/or those that require greater use of assumptions and estimates are discussed in the section “Estimates and Valuations”. ----- The Group has chosen to present the structure and content of its consolidated financial statements in the following manner: - the consolidated statement of financial position is presented with separate sections for assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities are then presented on the basis of their classification as current, non-current or held for sale; - the consolidated income statement is presented in a vertical format with items broken down by nature, as this provides reliable and more relevant information than a classification by function; - the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is presented separately from the consolidated income statement, and each item is shown net of the tax effect; - the consolidated statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method; - the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity is presented by showing separately the profit or loss for the year and any income and expense recognized directly in equity and not in the income statement, in accordance with specific IAS/IFRS requirements. It also shows separately the transactions with shareholders.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Founded in 1967, Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. operates in the business of coated board made from recycled fibers (WLC — White Lined Chipboard). With its headquarters and production plant in Castellbisbal, Catalonia, the company has an annual production capacity of 180,000 tonnes and a staff of around 230 employees. Specifically, Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. is the largest producer of cardboard in Spain, one of the most important paper mills in southern Europe and the seventh largest in Europe in the WLC sector. In the latest financial year ended December 31, 2017, the company recorded (under Spanish accounting standards) revenues from sales of €122.3 million, EBITDA of €5.1 million and a net profit of €1.4 million. At December 31, 2017, the net financial debt amounted at €11.5 million. The acquisition of Barcelona Cartoboard S.A.U. will allow the RDM Group to strengthen its presence in a well-known market, to optimize its product portfolio and to further improve the level of service to existing and new customers. In effect, thanks to the proximity of the Barcelona plant to several of the major European converters, strategic customers can be reached very quickly. ----- The acquisition of control of Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. is a business combination transaction, recognized in accordance with IFRS 3 — Business combinations. At the date of acquisition of control, the following was arranged: (i) the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were measured at fair value; (ii) goodwill, equal to €0.5 million, resulting from the difference between the purchase price of 100% of Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U., equal to €36.5 million and the fair value of the net assets acquired, equal to €36 million, was recorded under assets. The purchase price will be subject to adjustment according to the purchase agreement. The purchase price is based on an enterprise value of €46.4 million and an NFP estimated at about €9.9 million at the time of acquisition. To determine the fair value of tangible fixed assets it was decided to adopt the market approach, making use the appraisals conducted by an independent expert. At the acquisition date, the value assigned to tangible fixed assets was €47.8 million. The greater value, equal to €31.5 million, allocated to the above-mentioned tangible fixed assets, generated the recording in the financial statements of deferred taxes of €2.2 million. The acquisition was financed by Reno De Medici S.p.A. mainly through recourse to specific financial loan. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 — Business combinations, the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was determined on a provisional basis, because at the date of the consolidated financial statements several valuation processes involving the current assets, liabilities and the identification of contingent assets and liabilities have not yet been finalized. These values could undergo changes within 12 months of the acquisition date. The provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities of Barcelona Cartonboard S.A.U. at the date of acquisition, which represent the management’s best estimate, are summarized below. The respective tax effects for each liability or asset measured at fair value were also accounted for as deferred tax assets or as deferred tax provision.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The definition of control is not based solely on the concept of legal ownership. According to IFRS 10 the definition of control is based on three elements: (a) power over the business purchased; (b) exposure or rights, at variable returns resulting from involvement with the latter; (c) capacity to utilize the power to influence the amount of these returns. IFRS 10 stipulates that in order to evaluate whether it has control over the acquired business, an investor should focus only on activities that materially affect returns and rights which are substantial, i.e., can be exercised in practice when important decisions have to be taken with regard to the acquired business. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is acquired until the date that such control ceases to exist. The portions of shareholders’ equity and profit or loss attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated income statement, and consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The main consolidation principles adopted are as follows: - the carrying amount of each investment consolidated on a line-by-line basis is eliminated against the related equity, with the assets, liabilities, income and expense of the subsidiary being added to those of the Parent Company, regardless of the size of the investment; the shares of subsidiaries’ capital and reserves and of subsidiaries’ profit or loss attributable to minority interests are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement; - the acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method as provided for by IFRS 3 (Revised) (see “Business Combinations”); - all balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated, as are any profits and losses (unless losses indicate an impairment of the sold asset requiring recognition) arising from commercial or financial intragroup transactions not yet realized with third parties; - any increases or decreases in a subsidiary’s equity arising from its post-acquisition results are recorded upon elimination in the “Retained earnings (losses)” equity reserve; - dividends paid by Group companies were eliminated from the income statement upon consolidation; - In the event of loss of control, the Group will eliminate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any third-party interests, and the other components of equity relative to the subsidiaries. The profit or loss from the loss of control will be recognized in the profit or loss for the year. Any equity interest maintained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value on the date that control is lost.

Under this method, the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in the income statement at the time they are incurred. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value as at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase gain. At the acquisition date, non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice between the two methods is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Any contingent consideration arrangement in the business combination is measured at its acquisitiondate fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination in order to determine goodwill.

Cost is reduced by accumulated depreciation and any impairment. Costs for improvements, modernization and transformation incurred after the initial recognition of the asset acquired or produced internally are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across their useful life, provided they derive from separate analytical accounting measurements and when it is probable that the future economic benefits expected from the asset will increase. Replacement costs of identifiable components of complex assets are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across their useful life. The residual value of the replaced component is ascribed to the income statement. Maintenance and repair costs are ascribed to the income statement in the year they are incurred. Assets acquired under finance leases, which essentially assign to the Group all the risks and rewards of ownership, are recognized as tangible fixed assets at the lower of their current value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.

1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1135,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1135.4,Impairment test on tangible assets,1135.4.1,,"Description of the key audit matter** Reno De Medici Group’s consolidated financial statements include Euro 245.9 million related to tangible assets as of December 31, 2018. As required by the “IAS 36 Impairment of Assets”, the Directors, noting impairment indicators, have carried out the impairment test in order to determine that tangible assets are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 at a value not higher than the recoverable value. Based on the impairment test approved by the Board of Directors, the Directors assessed that the carrying value of tangible assets is lower than the recoverable value and therefore no impairment losses were recognized. The recoverable amount of the abovementioned tangible assets was determined using the value in use, based on estimates of cash flows generated by the assets. To test these assets, the Directors referred to the individual Group’s plants as cash-generating units (CGU), which correspond to a single company when referring to the Group’s subsidiaries. With reference to the no longer operating part of the Magenta plant, in order to assess the recoverable value, it was necessary to use the fair value method less costs to sell that the Directors determined based on the preliminary sales agreement of land and buildings, signed in November 2018, for the disposal of the entire area. The valuation process is complex and based on assumptions concerning, among others, the forecast of expected cash flows of each CGU, resulting from the plans used for the purposes of the impairment test, and the determination of an appropriate discount rate (WACC) and medium-term growth rate (g-rate). In determining cash flow forecasts, the most relevant variables are the estimate of future sales volumes, the expected sales price trend, the variable costs of fibrous and chemical materials, margins, capital expenditures and other macroeconomic variables. Future expectations and market conditions influence these assumptions. Considering the relevance of the amount of tangible assets recorded in the financial statements, the subjectivity of the estimates relating to the determination of cash flows (DCF) and the key variables of the impairment model, we considered the impairment test a key audit matter of the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The “Impairment test”paragraph of the consolidated financial statements states the disclosures related to ----- the impairment test, including a sensitivity analysis performed by the Directors, which shows the effects that may occur on the recoverable value of tangible assets resulting from the changes in certain key assumptions used for the impairment test. Audit procedures performed** Preliminarily, we have examined how the Directors determine the value in use of the CGUs by analyzing the methods and assumptions used and considered for the development of the impairment test. As part of our audit, we have, among others, carried out the following procedures, also with the support of experts: - understand the Company’s relevant internal controls on the impairment test process; - analysis of the reasonableness of the key assumptions underlying the cash flow calculation; also, through information obtained from the Management; - analysis of the actual figures compared to the plans in order to assess the nature of the deviations and the reliability of the planning process; - analysis of the reasonableness of the discount rate (WACC) and long-term growth rate (g-rate); - review of the mathematical accuracy of the model used to estimate the value in use of the CGUs; - review of the correct calculation of the book value of the CGUs; - review of the Directors’ sensitivity analysis; - analysis of the preliminary sales agreement used by the Directors to determine the fair value of the land and buildings of the area of Magenta; - analysis of the estimate made by the Directors relating to the cost to sell of the land and buildings referred to in the previous point. Further, we also examined the adequacy and compliance of the disclosure provided by the Company on the impairment test based on IAS 36 disclosure requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1135,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1135.5,Accounting recognition of business combinations,1135.5.1,,"Description of the key audit matter** During 2018 the Group acquired 66.67% of PAC Service S.p.A., a company key audit matter operating in the cardboard processing sector, and 100% of Barcelona Cartonboard SAU, a Spanish company operating in the white lined chipboard sector. The business combinations were accounted for in the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with the international accounting ----- standard IFRS 3 “Business combinations,” which provides for the acquisition cost allocation process (Purchase Price Allocation — “PPA”). This required the evaluation by Management, along with the support of independent fair value specialists, of the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The acquisition of PAC Service S.p.A. was accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages, therefore, entailing the adjustment of the previously held interest (equal to 33.33%) to the relative fair value and allocating the difference with the previous book value in the income statement as gains from investments. The allocation of PPA values generated, at the acquisition date, the recognition in the consolidated financial statements of tangible assets of Euro 5.2 million, of which, Euro 2.5 million relate to the higher value of the aforementioned assets, Deferred taxes of Euro 0.7 million and Goodwill of Euro 4.3 million. With regard to the acquisition of Barcelona Cartonboard SAU, the accounting for the business combination was determined on a provisional basis, as permitted by IFRS 3, because, as of the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the Directors had not finalized the valuation processes, as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The provisional allocation of PPA values generated, among others, the recognition in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date of tangible assets of Euro 47.8 million, of which Euro 31.5 million relate to the higher value of the aforementioned tangible assets, Deferred taxes of Euro 2.2 million and Goodwill of Euro 0.5 million. Given the relevance of the effects of the transactions and the complexity related to the valuation process, mainly related to the determination of the fair value of the net assets acquired, we considered the recognition of the business combinations a key audit matter of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as at December 31, 2018. The financial statement disclosure related to this matter is reported in the notes to the financial statements and, in particular, in the paragraph “Scope of consolidation”. Audit procedures performed As part of our audit we have, among others, carried out the following audit procedures, also with the support of experts: - analysis of the agreements relating to business combinations transactions; - analysis of the criteria used by the Directors to account for the transactions in accordance with the international accounting standard IFRS 3 ----- “Business combinations”; - analysis of the procedures carried out and understanding of the relevant controls put in place by the Directors; - discussion with the Directors about the application of the “purchase method” for accounting recognition of the transactions; - analysis of the criteria followed to identify the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, for the estimate, or provisional estimate in the case of the acquisition of Barcelona Cartonboard SAU, of the related fair values; - examination, also through the support of our specialists, of reports and opinions prepared by the independent fair value specialists appointed by the Company to support the evaluations of the Directors. Analysis of the methodological approach, competence and objectivity of the independent fair value specialists appointed by the Company; - Review of the accuracy of the accounting entries. Further, we have also examined the adequacy of the disclosures provided by the Group on the business combination and the compliance with the accounting standard IFRS 3.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: ----- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, includingthe disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence applicable in Italy, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a voluntary basis in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting, while the Company’s financial statements for previous periods were prepared in accordance with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code and the firm pronouncements in the Guidelines for Annual Reporting in the Netherlands as issued by the Dutch Accounting Standards Board. It was therefore necessary to carry out a transition process in accordance with IFRS 1 — First Adoption and, for this purpose, January 1, 2020 was identified as the transition date to IFRS (“Transition Date”). The information relating to the transition process required by IFRS 1 is reported in note 14 “Transition to International Accounting Standards”. The Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European Union (hereafter, “IFRS”). However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual financial statements. The designation IFRS includes all “International Financial Reporting Standards”, all “International Accounting Standards” (“IAS”) and all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”), formerly the Standing Interpretations Committee (“SIC”), adopted as of the reporting date, by the European Union in accordance with the procedures provided for in Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002. The IFRS were applied consistently to all the periods presented in this document. The Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the management has verified the absence of financial, management or other indicators that could indicate critical issues regarding the Group’s ability to meet its obligations in the foreseeable future, and in particular in the next 12 months. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (continued)",1135.37.2,,"The Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and presented in Euro, which represents the functional currency of the prevailing economic environment in which the Group operates. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts included in this document are expressed in Euro thousand. Costs for improvements, modernization and transformation incurred after the initial recognition of the asset acquired or produced internally are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across their useful life, provided they derive from separate analytical accounting measurements and when it is probable that the future economic benefits expected from the asset will increase. Replacement costs of identifiable components of complex assets are ascribed to fixed assets and depreciated across their useful life. The residual value of the replaced component is ascribed to the income statement. Maintenance and repair costs are ascribed to the income statement in the year they are incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of assets, determined on the basis of the period during which the asset will be used by the company. Land is not depreciated, even if acquired together with buildings. The useful life applied to each category for the purpose of depreciation is highlighted below: indicators). If any such signs exist, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets to determine the write-down amount (impairment test). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is estimated by taking into account the provisions contained in accounting standard IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. In estimating the value in use, expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the estimated recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The resulting impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. When there is no longer any reason for an impairment loss to be recognized, the carrying amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to a new carrying amount based on its estimated recoverable value, which may not exceed the net carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized. The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. It should be noted that for the nine-months ended 2021 and the comparative period no impairment indicators were identified referring to tangible and intangible assets with a finite useful life. _Defined benefit plans_ The Group’s net obligations are determined separately for each plan by estimating the present value of future benefits that employees have earned in the current and prior periods and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is measured using actuarial techniques and actuarial assumptions that are unbiased and mutually compatible and attributes benefits to periods in which the obligation to provide post-employment benefits arise by using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The components of the defined benefit cost are recognized as follows: - the service costs are recognized in the consolidated income statement by function and presented in the relevant line items (cost of sales, selling, general and administrative costs, research and development costs, etc.); - the net interest on the defined benefit liability is recognized in the consolidated income statement as net financial income/(expenses), and is determined by multiplying the net liability/(asset) by the discount rate used to discount obligations taking into account the effect of contributions and benefit payments made during the year; and - the remeasurement components of the net obligations, which comprise actuarial gains and losses and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income/ (loss). These remeasurement components are not reclassified in the consolidated income statement in a subsequent period.

Subsidiaries are deconsolidated from the date when control ceases.

Any retained interest in the former subsidiary is then remeasured to its fair value. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. All significant intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealized gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

The expected liability, net of any payments in advance or withholding tax incurred, is recognized under “Current taxes”. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base. “Deferred tax liabilities” consist of deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences which will be taxed in future years in accordance with prevailing tax legislation. “Deferred tax assets”consist of taxes which, despite being recoverable in future years, refer to the current year and are recognized where it is probable that future taxable income will be sufficient to absorb their recovery. Deferred tax liabilities were offset by deferred tax assets where conditions specified in IAS 12 were met, notably where the two items relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and where there is a legally enforceable right to offset in this manner. Income taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly credited or charged to shareholders’ equity, in which case the tax effect is recognized directly in that item. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the carryforward of unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the unused tax losses can be used.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Sales are realised in both the domestic and foreign markets. 1.2 Going Concern The accounting principles applied to the valuation of assets and liabilities and the determination of results in these financial statements are based on the going concern assumption. 1.3 Implications of COVID-19 on our business _Introduction_ The COVID-19 outbreak and resulting measures taken by various governments to contain the virus have slightly negatively affected our business in the first three months of 2020. The results for April and May have been impacted by drop in volume but have to large extent recovered in June to August. Consequently COVID-19 has impacted the full year result but due to the relatively quick recovery the impact is limited. In addition to the already known effects, the macroeconomic uncertainty has a negative impact on the economic activity and it is unknown what the longer term impact on our business may be. The scale and duration of this pandemic remain uncertain but are expected to further impact our business. Effects of the COVID-19 crisis on our business have also been described in note 26 Post balance sheet events. _Description of the measures taken to guarantee going concern_ As several governments are providing aid to businesses located in their country, there are a few regulations which will partly mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. Management has applied for government support in the Netherlands and the USA. Management also prepared several internal measures to minimize the impact of COVID-19. Some of which have already been acted upon to save costs and maintain liquidity, such as reducing operational expenses and less crucial capital expenses. Other measures are prepared to act upon when needed, in order to meet its obligations and the agreed upon covenants with the bank. We continue to follow the various national institutes policies and advice and in parallel we continue our operations in the best and safest way possible. The uncertain development of sales volume might negatively impact liquidity. Management believes the current financing agreements with its bank, its positive liquidity position, the ability to obtain support from the different external measures and the internal measures taken and prepared will be sufficient to meet our obligations and the agreed upon covenants with the bank. The conclusions of management are also based on several forecast calculations, including pessimistic scenarios. _Closing_ Although uncertainties remain and that currently it is difficult to estimate the future impact, management does believe that COVID-19 will result in a negative effect on the financial conditions and liquidity of the group. Despite the uncertainty, we do not believe, however, that the impact of the COVID-19 virus will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. 1.4 Accounting policies The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code and the firm pronouncements in the Guidelines for Annual Reporting in the Netherlands as issued by the Dutch Accounting Standards Board. ----- 1.5 Registered office Fineska B.V. has its registered office at Noorderstraat 394, 9611 AW, Sappemeer and is registred at the chamber of commerce under number 59196203. Statutory seat is Hoogezand-Sappemeer, the Netherlands. 1.6 Group structure Fineska B.V. is head of the Eska group and is headquarted in Hoogezand-Sappemeer, the Netherlands. 1.7 Consolidation The consolidation includes the financial information of Fineska B.V., its group companies and other legal persons in which it exercises decisive control or whose central management it conducts. Group companies are legal entities in which Fineska B.V. exercises direct or indirect decisive control due to its possession of the majority of the voting rights, or who's financial and operating activities it can otherwise control. Potential voting rights that can directly be exercised on the balance sheet date are also taken into account. Group companies and other legal persons in whom Fineska B.V. exercises decisive control or whose central management it conducts are consolidated in full. Minority interests in group equity and group profit are disclosed separately. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances among group companies and other consolidated legal persons are eliminated. Unrealised losses on intercompany transactions are eliminated as well, unless such a loss qualifies as impairment. The accounting policies of group companies were changed where necessary, in order to align them to the prevailing group accounting policies. Since the income statement for 2018 of Fineska B.V. is included in the consolidated financial statements, an abridged income statement has been disclosed (in the company financial statements) in accordance with Section 402, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code. The consolidated financial statements comprise the financials of Fineska B.V. and the following Group companies:",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

Also, entities which can control the company are considered a related party. In addition, statutory directors, other key management Fineska B.V. and Eska B.V. and close relatives are regarded as related parties. Significant transactions with related parties are disclosed in the notes insofar as they are not transacted under normal market conditions. The nature, extent and other information is disclosed if this is required for to provide the true and fair view. 1.9 Acquisition and disposal of group companies Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognised in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date, being the moment that control can be exercised over the acquired company. ----- The acquisition price consists of the cash consideration, or equivalent, agreed for acquiring the company plus any directly attributable expenses. If the acquisition price exceeds the net amount of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, the excess is capitalised as goodwill under intangible assets. If the acquisition price is lower than the net amount of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, the difference (i.e., negative goodwill) is disclosed under accruals and deferred income (refer to the respective note). Entities continue to be consolidated until they are sold; they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases and if they are classified as held-for-disposal. 1.10 Notes to the cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. The cash items disclosed in the cash flow statement comprise cash at banks and cash in hand — except for deposits with a maturity longer than three months — and the bank overdraft forming part of the current liabilities. Cash flows denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at average estimated exchange rates. Exchange differences affecting cash items are shown separately in the cash flow statement. Interest paid and received, dividends received and income taxes are included in cash from operating activities. Dividends paid are recognised as cash used in financing activities. The purchase consideration paid for the acquired group company has been recognised as cash used in investing activities where it was settled in cash. Any cash at banks and in hand in the acquired group company have been deducted from the purchase consideration. Investments in group companies are recognised at acquisition cost less cash and cash equivalents available in the company acquired at the time of acquisition. Transactions not resulting in inflow or outflow of cash, including finance leases, are not recognised in the cash flow statement. The value of the related asset and lease liability are disclosed in the notes to the balance sheet items. Payments of finance lease instalments qualify as repayments of borrowings under cash used in financing activities and as interest paid under cash generated from operating activities. 1.11 Changes in accounting policies The group has not implemented changes in the accounting policy. 1.12 Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the relevant rules requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the cessary for the purposes of providing the view required under Section 362(1), Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code, the nature of these estimates and judgments, including the related assumptions, is disclosed in the notes to the financial statement items in question. The Company has applied for government support in the Netherlands and USA in 2020 related to the COVID 19 pandemic. No final declaration for these support programs has been filed and to our best knowledge and estimation the impact has been accounted for the 2020 results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1135,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1135.136,2** **Principles of valuation of assets and liabilities,1135.136.1,,"2.1 General In general, assets and liabilities are stated at the amounts at which they were acquired or incurred, or fair value. If not specifically stated otherwise, they are recognised at the amounts at which they were acquired or incurred. The balance sheet and profit and loss account include references to the notes. 2.2 Comparison with prior year The principles of valuation of assets and liabilities and determination of result remain unchanged compared to the prior year. ----- 2.3 Foreign currencies _Functional currency_ Items included in the financial statements of group companies are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective group company operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and presentation currency of Fineska B.V. _Transactions, receivables and payables_ Transactions denominated in foreign currencies during the reporting period are recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rate ruling at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are converted to the closing rate of the functional currency on the balance sheet date. The translation differences resulting from settlement and conversion are credited or charged to the income statement, unless hedge-accounting is applied. Non-monetary assets valued at historical cost in a foreign currency are converted at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Nonmonetary assets valued at fair value in a foreign currency are converted at the exchange rate on the date on which the fair value was determined. Translation differences in relation to intragroup long-term loans that effectively constitute an increase or decrease in net investments in foreign operations are directly recognised in equity as a component of the statutory reserve for translation differences. Exchange rate differences arising on foreign currency loans that are entered into to finance the net investment in a foreign participation are recognised in the translation differences reserve insofar that such loans effectively hedge the exchange rate exposure on that net investment. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on trading transactions are taken to operating result; those arising on cash and cash equivalents, current investments and borrowing are taken to financial items. _Group companies_ Assets and liabilities of consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the financial year. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries and translated at the closing rate. Any resulting exchange differences are taken directly to the legal reserve for translation differences within equity. 2.4 Intangible fixed assets _Research and development expenditure_ Research expenditure is recognised in the income statement. Expenditure incurred for development projects is capitalised as a component of manufacturing price if the projects in question are likely to be commercially and technically viable (i.e., it is likely that economic benefits will be realised) and the expenditure can be reliably estimated. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised as soon as the commercial production process has commenced, with amortisation being based on the estimated useful life of the asset. _Goodwill_ Goodwill arising from acquisitions, and determined in line with note 1.7, is brought to the shareholders equity in the year of acquisition. Goodwill resulting from acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life. _Software_ Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 5 year period on a straight-line basis. External direct costs of materials and services are ----- capatilized which are associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. For determining whether an impairment charge in respect of an intangible fixed asset applies, reference is made to note 2.7. 2.5 Tangible fixed assets Land and buildings are valued either at cost plus additional direct expenses, less straight-line depreciation over the estimated economic life or market value if lower. Land is not depreciated. Any impairment as at the balance sheet date is taken into account. For determining whether an impairment charge in respect of a tangible fixed asset applies, reference is made to note 2.7. Other fixed assets are valued at acquisition or production cost including directly attributable expenses, less straight-line depreciation over the estimated useful economic life, or market value if lower. Directly attributable production cost includes the costs of the raw materials and consumables, and also includes interest during construction and installation costs. Spare parts that are specifically attributable to certain machines or installations are capitalised. Technical materials are valuated at acquisition costs including directly attributable expenses or realisable value if lower. Investment subsidies are deducted from the relating acquisition or production cost. Tangible fixed assets operated by the Group under financial lease agreements are capitalised, the cost of which has been determined as the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the sum of the discounted value of future lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are presented under liabilities with the interest element of the finance charge being taken to income over the lease period. Tangible fixed assets acquired under financial lease agreements are depreciated over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease period. Expenses regarding major repairs to buildings, machinery and equipment are valued at acquisition or production cost, less straight-line depreciation over the estimated useful economic life, or market value if lower. No provision is made for future major repairs. 2.6 Financial fixed assets _Associates_ Group companies and other associates in which the Company exercises significant influence, generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% or more of the voting rights, are stated at net asset value. Net asset value is calculated using the accounting policies applied in these financial statements. Associates whose financial information cannot be aligned to these policies are valued based on their own accounting policies. Associates with an equity deficit are carried at nil. A provision is formed if and when Fineska B.V. is fully or partially liable for the debts of the associate, or has the firm intention to allow the associate to pay its debts. Associates acquired are initially measured at the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities upon acquisition. Any subsequent valuation is based on the accounting policies that apply to these financial statements, taking into account the initial valuation. Associates in which no significant influence can be exercised are recognised at cost. If an asset qualifies as impaired, it is measured at its impaired value; any write-offs are disclosed in the income statement (refer to note 2.7). _Loans to associates_ Receivables recognised under financial fixed assets are initially valued at the fair value less transaction cost (if material). These receivables are subsequently valued at amortised cost. For determining the value, any impairments are taken into account. ----- _Other receivables_ Other receivables disclosed under financial assets include issued loans and other receivables as well as purchased loans and debentures that will be held to their maturity date. These receivables are initially measured at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortised cost. If debentures are acquired or loans are issued at a discount or premium, the discount or premium is recognised through profit or loss over the maturities of the debentures or loans using the effective interest method. Also transaction costs are included in the initial valuation and recognised in profit or loss as part of the effective interest method. Impairment losses are deducted from amortised cost and expensed in the income statement. 2.7 Impairment of fixed assets At each balance sheet date, the Company tests whether there are any indications of assets being subject to impairment. If any such indications exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. If this proves to be impossible, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is identified. An asset is subject to impairment if its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount; the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is determined based on the active market. For the purposes of determining value in use, cash flows are discounted at market rate. An impairment loss is directly expensed in the income statement. If it is established that a previously recognised impairment loss no longer applies or has declined, the increased carrying amount of the assets in question is not set any higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no asset impairment been recognised. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the impairment loss is determined and recognised in the income statement. The amount of an impairment loss incurred on financial assets stated at amortised cost is measured as the of estimated future cash flows, the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss shall be reversed. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount of the reversal shall be recognised in profit or loss. If an impairment loss has been incurred on an investment in an equity instrument carried at cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial assets and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. The impairment loss shall be reversed only if the evidence of impairment is objectively shown to have been removed. 2.8 Inventories The raw materials and consumables are valued at acquisitions cost using the FIFO or lower realisable value. Inventories of semi-finished and finished products are stated at the lower of standard manufacturing cost or realisable value. Cost comprises the cost of raw materials and consumables, labour costs, depreciation, other direct costs and related production overhead. The realisable value is the estimated sales price less directly attributable sales costs. In determining the realisable value the obsolescence of the inventories is taken into account. 2.9 Receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. If payment of the receivable is postponed under an extended payment deadline, fair value is measured on the ----- basis of the discounted value of the expected revenues. Interest gains are recognised using the effective interest method. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. 2.10 Construction contracts Construction contracts are carried at contract revenue generated, which is comprised of contract costs incurred and attributable profits (for details, see the accounting policy set out in Note 3.2). Where appropriate, recognised losses and progress billings are deducted from construction contracts. Construction contracts are recognised as a current liability where progress billings exceed contract revenue. 2.11 Cash at banks and in hand Cash at banks and in hand consists of cash in hand, cash at banks and deposits with a maturity of less than twelve months and internal in-house bank accounts within the Group. Overdrafts at banks are recognised as part of debts to lending institutions under current liabilities. Cash at banks and in hand is carried at nominal value. 2.12 Shareholders' equity Where the Group purchases its own shares, the acquisition price of the shares purchased is deducted from other reserves, until the moment these shares are cancelled or sold. If purchased shares are sold, the proceeds on the sale are added to other reserves. Expenses directly related to the purchase, sale and/or issue of new shares are charged directly to corporate income tax effects. Other direct movements within taking into account relevant corporate income tax effects. 2.13 Provisions Provisions are formed for legally enforceable or constructive obligations existing on the balance sheet date, the settlement of which is likely to require an outflow of resources whose extent can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured on the basis of the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligations as at the balance sheet date. Provisions are stated at the discounted value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligations. _Jubilee benefits_ The provision for jubilee benefits is measured at the present value of expected benefits payable during employment. The calculation of the provision takes the likely stay into account. Future salary increases are not taken in account. The present value factor is based at an interest rate of 3.0% (2019: 3.0%). _Staff Leaving Indemnity_ The staff leaving indemnity is a legal obligation in Italy. It is a remuneration connected with the employment service rendered, with payment deferred to the termination of the employment relationship. In some cases the employee can ask for an advance payment. The annual accrual is a fixed % of the salary. The accrual increases each year applying a 1.5% fixed rate and by 75% of the increase in the index of consumer prices for families of workers, ascertained by ISTAT, compared with December of the prior year. _Restructuring_ The restructuring provision is recognised at the nominal value of the for the settlement of the obligation expected outflow of money. 2.14 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of timing differences between valuation of assets and liabilities according to fiscal provisions on the one hand and the valuation principles as used in ----- these financial statements on the other. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on the ruling tax rates as at year-end or future applicable rates, insofar as already decreed by law. Deferred tax assets, including those from losses carried forward, are valued if it is probable that fiscal profit will be available to offset losses, and settlement possibilities can be utilised. Deferred taxes liabilities are recognised for timing differences in respect of group companies, participations and joint ventures unless the Group is in a position to determine the reversal date of the timing difference, and it is not probable that the timing difference will reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxes are valued at nominal value. Deferred tax assets are recognised under financial fixed assets; deferred tax liabilities are recognised under provisions. 2.15 Liabilities Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised costs, being the amount received taking account of any premium or discount, less transaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 2.16 Leasing _Financial lease_ The Group leases part of the machinery and has, to a large extent, the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of these assets. When the lease contract is entered into, the assets are capitalised on the balance sheet at their fair value, or the cash value of the minimum lease terms, if lower. The lease amounts payable are split on an annuity basis between a redemption and interest part, based on a fixed interest rate. The relating lease obligations, excluding the interest element, are taken up under long-term liabilities. The interest component of the lease term is recognised in the profit and loss account. The relating assets are depreciated over the remaining economic life or lease term, if shorter. _Operating lease_ Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 2.17 Financial instruments Securities included in financial and current assets are stated at fair value. All other on-balance financial instruments are carried at (amortised) cost. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. If no fair value can be readily and reliably established, fair value is approximated by deriving it from the fair value of components or of a comparable financial instrument, or by approximating fair value using valuation models and valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include using ailable, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models, making allowance for entityspecific inputs. The valuation of derivative financial instruments depends on the instrument: is it quoted in an active market or not. If the underlying object of the derivative financial instrument is listed on a stock exchange, it is valued at fair value. If the object is not quoted in an active market, it will be stated at amortised cost. Recognition of changes in the value of a derivative financial instrument is dependent on whether or not the instrument is designated as a hedging instrument. ----- Fineska B.V. applies hedge accounting. The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Company also tests its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. _Cost price hedge_ In applying cost price hedge accounting, the initial recognition of, and the accounting policies for, the hedging instrument are dependent on the hedged item, which has the following implications: - if as the hedged item is recognised at cost in the balance sheet, the derivate instrument is also stated at cost; - as long as the hedged item is not yet recognised in the balance sheet, the hedging instrument is not remeasured. This applies, for instance, to hedging currency risks on future transactions. If the hedged item qualifies as a monetary item denominated in a foreign currency, the derivative instrument, where it has currency elements, is also stated at the spot rate at the balance sheet date. If the derivate instrument has currency elements, the difference between the spot rate on the date the derivate instrument is contracted and the forward rate at which it will be settled is spread over the maturity of the derivative instrument. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised directly in profit or loss. Fineska B.V. shall discontinue prospectively the cost price hedge accounting if: - the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; - the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. Fineska B.V. uses cost price hedge accounting for: - forward exchange contracts and options intended for future sales in GB pounds and in US dollars; - interest SWAPS to mitigate its interest risks on the long-term loans.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

The results on transactions are recognised in the year they are realised. 3.2 Revenue recognition _General_ Net turnover comprises the income from the supply of goods and services and realised income from construction contracts after deduction of discounts and such like and of taxes levied on the turnover. _Sales of goods_ Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when all significant risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer. _Sales of services_ Revenue from sales of services is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method based on the services performed to the balance sheet date as a percentage of the total services to be performed. ----- _Contract revenue and costs_ When the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised as revenue and costs in the income statement under the percentage-of-completion method. The stage of completion is measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to the balance sheet date as a percentage of total estimated costs for each contract. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised as revenue in the income statement only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable; contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they were incurred. When the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method by reference to the services provided up to the balance sheet date. Profit or loss is determined as the difference between contract revenue and contract costs. Contract revenue comprises the initial amount agreed in the contract; variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are also included in contract revenue to the extent that they may have been agreed with the customer and are capable of being reliably measured. Contract costs comprise costs that relate directly to the specific contract, costs that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the contract, and such other costs as are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the contract. If it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenues, any expected excess of total contract costs over total contract revenue for the contract is recognised as an expense immediately within cost of sales. The provision for the loss is recognised within construction contracts. 3.3 Exchange differences Exchange differences arising upon the settlement or conversion of monetary items are recognised in the income statement in the period that they arise, unless they are hedged. 3.4 Costs Costs are recognised on the historical cost convention and are allocated to the reporting year to which they relate. 3.5 Personnel remuneration _Regular payments_ Salaries, wages and social security costs are charged to the profit and loss account when due, and in accordance with employment contracts and obligations. _Pensions_ The Group has applied the liability method for pension plans. The premiums payable for the financial year are charged to the result. The Group pays contributions to pension funds and insurance companies on a compulsory, contractual or voluntary basis. Except for the payment of contributions, the Group has no other obligation in connection with these pension schemes. _Dutch pension plans_ Fineska B.V. has a number of pension plans. The main characteristics of these plans are: - Pension plans are defined benefit schemes and are based on average-salary schemes. - Until 31 December 2011 the pension commitments were insured at insurance company Zwitserleven. - Since 1 January 2012 the pension commitments were placed at ""Pensioenfonds Grafische Bedrijven"" (PGB). Transfer of the standard pensions from Zwitserleven to PGB was not possible due to the coverage rate of the funds. ----- The conditions of the Dutch Pension Act are applicable. Fineska B.V. pays premiums based on contractual basis to the pension provider. Premiums are recognised as personnel costs when they are due. There are no other obligations other than premiums to be paid to the pension provider. _Foreign pension plans_ For foreign pension plans similar to the way the Dutch pension system is designed and operates, recognition and measurement of liabilities arising from these pension schemes are carried out in accordance with the valuation of the Dutch pension schemes. 3.6 Depreciation Intangible assets, including goodwill, are amortised and tangible fixed assets are depreciated over their expected useful life as from the inception of their use. Land and investment property are not depreciated. Future depreciation is adjusted if there is a change in estimated future useful life. Gains and losses from the occasional sale of property, plant or equipment are included in depreciation. 3.7 Financial income and expense Interest income and expense are time apportioned, taking into account the effective interest rate for the relating assets and liabilities. The treatment of interest expenses for loans received takes account of any transaction costs. 3.8 Taxation Profit tax is calculated on the profit/loss before taxation in the profit and loss account, taking into account any losses carried forward from previous financial years (insofar as these are not included in deferred tax assets), tax-exempt items and non-deductible expenses, and using current tax rates. Account is also taken of changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities owing to changes in the applicable tax rates. 3.9 Results from participations The result is the amount by which the carrying amount of the participation has changed since the previous financial statements as a result of the earnings achieved by the participation to the extent that this can be attributed to Fineska B.V.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, the board of directors should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The board of directors should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,767
1821,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.5,Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements,103.5.1,,"Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others: - identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; ----- - obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control; - evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors; - concluding on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern. - evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures; and - evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are also responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. We provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.
