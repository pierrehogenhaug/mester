You are reminded that this Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession this Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver this Offering

**MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt
securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to
sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**UK MIFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes,
taking into account the five categories referred to in item 18 of the Guidelines published by the European
Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on 5 February 2018 (in accordance with the FCA’s policy
statement entitled “Brexit our approach to EU non-legislative materials”), has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS**

**United States**

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties, and
acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Memorandum under the “Transfer Restrictions” section of
this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act or with any securities regulatory
authority of any state or other jurisdiction in the United States and may not be offered or sold in the United
States, except to QIBs within the meaning of Rule 144A, in reliance on the exemption from the registration
requirements of the US Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. Prospective investors are hereby notified that
sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the US
Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Notes may be offered and sold outside the United States in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering
and (ii) the Issue Date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within
the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the US Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A
under the US Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.
For a description of certain restrictions on transfers of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.” Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The securities offered hereby have not been reviewed or recommended by any US federal or state securities
commission or regulatory authority. Furthermore, the foregoing authorities have not passed upon the merits of
the Offering or confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense under the laws of the United States.

**Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters
relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article
49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order,
(iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) (the
“FSMA”) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused
to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering
Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is
available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**UK MIFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market:** Solely for the
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes,
taking into account the five categories referred to in item 18 of the Guidelines published by the European
Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on 5 February 2018 (in accordance with the FCA’s policy
statement entitled “Brexit our approach to EU non-legislative materials”), has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the UK For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No.
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”);

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA, or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities
described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has
been prepared, and therefore, offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

For the purposes of the foregoing, the expression “offering” includes the communication in any form and by any
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor
to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

**Notice to European Economic Area Investors**

**MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt
securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to
sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID
II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore, offering or selling the securities or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of the foregoing, the expression “offering” includes the communication in any form and by any
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any Member State of
the EEA that is subject to the EU Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the EU
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the EU Prospectus Regulation.

otherwise made available, in Belgium to any “consumer” (consument/consommateur) within the meaning of the
Belgian Code of Economic Law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit économique) of February 28,
2013, as amended from time to time.

**France**

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by and will not be submitted for approval to the French
Autorité des marchés financiers for the purposes of an offer or sale to retail investors in France. Consequently,

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

**Historical financial information**

All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Senior Notes Issuer is a holding company and the direct parent
entity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, owning all the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. It has no
revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations (other than de minimis
holding company activities, trade payables, taxes payable and provisions for taxes), material assets (other than
the shares it owns in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and debt instruments issued by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or certain other indirect subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer) or liabilities (other than those incurred in
connection with the Transactions and the PECs, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Preferred Equity
_Certificates”). Consequently, no financial information with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer is included in this_
Offering Memorandum. Unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect
of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Offering Memorandum
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union (“IFRS”). This Offering Memorandum includes an English translation of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and
2018 (the “Audited Financial Statements”).

The Audited Financial Statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Deloitte & Associés
(together, the “Auditors”). See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the reports of the statutory auditors
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the Audited Financial Statements. A free English language translation of
their audit reports thereon is included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates and judgments. These standards require management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in the Audited
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our Audited Financial Statements are presented in_
euro.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the year ended December 31,
2019, the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018 was restated to give effect to the
change in accounting presentation for Leemo revenue (see Note 2.7 to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019). Similarly, net profit (loss)
from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests as shown for 2018 has been adjusted to
reflect a minor presentation error. In the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
for the year ended December 31, 2020, the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019
and the consolidated income statement and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 were
restated for IFRS 16 Interpretations Committee implementation.

In the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the consolidated statement of
financial position as at December 31, 2019 and the consolidated income statement and cash flow statement for
the year ended December 31, 2019 were restated to give effect to application of the definitive decision of the
IFRS Interpretations Committee (the “IFRS IC”) and subsequent position statement of the Autorité des Normes
_Comptables (the “ANC”) on determining the lease terms of certain real estate leases. See “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the_
_Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting_
_policies—2019 Restatement” and note 3.2 to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s audited consolidated financial_
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. For ease of comparative review, we present
financial data reflecting the restatements when comparing information as of and for the year ended December
31, 2019 with information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Certain Changes in Accounting Standards and Accounting Policies**

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. On January 1, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16. We applied IFRS 16 using the cumulative catch
up approach, and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 was recognized as an adjustment to the
opening balance of retained earnings at the date of application, while comparative financial information and our
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 has not been restated and
instead apply IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, which were the equivalent predecessor accounting standard in effect at that
time. IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces
significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and
requiring the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for
short term leases and leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor
accounting have remained largely unchanged. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019
and 2020 exclude €36.0 million and €40.2 million, respectively, of rent costs not incurred as operating expenses
as a result of the application of IFRS 16. Due to the adoption of IFRS 16 and the associated accounting policy
changes applied, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020 are not directly comparable with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

**Other financial measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Operating Cash Flow, Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA,
Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate, Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted Revenue and leverage and coverage
ratios that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We present non-IFRS measures because
we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other
interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. For
more information about how we define these non-IFRS measures, see “Summary—Summary Historical
_Financial Information and Other Data—Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary Other Financial_
_and Operating Data—Other financial data.” Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our_
performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies in
our industry may calculate these measures differently and, consequently, our presentation may not be readily
comparable to other companies’ figures. In particular, you should not consider our non-IFRS measures to be
alternatives to (i) profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating
performance, (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to
meet our cash needs or (iii) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles.
Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a
substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Although certain of this data has been extracted
or derived from our consolidated financial statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, this data has not
been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. In this Offering Memorandum:

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA before asset disposal, completed acquisition, minority interest and
COVID-19 impacts.

“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue for the relevant
period.

“Adjusted Revenue” means revenue as adjusted for asset disposals, completed acquisitions, minority interests
and COVID-19 revenue impacts for the relevant periods.

“current capital expenditures” means the funds used to buy, maintain, or improve our fixed assets, including on
information technology, branches refurbishments, excluding the expenditures used in connection with
acquisitions.

“cost of net debt” is calculated as the cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings, less
financial income from cash investments.


-----

“EBITDA” is defined as net profit before net loss from discontinued operations, Income tax expense, share of
profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies, other financial income and expenses, net income from cash and
cash equivalents, cost of gross debt, non-recurring operating income (expenses) and elimination of net additions
to depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets.

“EBITDA Margin” is calculated as EBITDA divided by revenue for the relevant period.

“Operating Cash Flow” refers Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA adjusted for provisions, change in net working capital,
change in CICE (a tax credit for employment and competitiveness created in 2013 in France) and current capital
expenditures.

“Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA” is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for the pre-IFRS-16 impact on leases at our French
and international premises.

“Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate” is calculated as Operating Cash Flow divided by Pre-IFRS-16
EBITDA for the relevant period.

“Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin” is calculated as EBITDA pre-IFRS-16 divided by revenue for the relevant
period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, for pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin, total revenue was adjusted
for asset disposals.

“Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the expected EBITDA
impact of closed acquisitions in 2021, acquisitions with signed share purchase agreement expected to close in
the first half of 2021, acquisitions under exclusivity expected to close in the first half of 2021, additional
synergies from acquisitions (from 12 to 18 months), capped transfer fee since June 1, 2020 and Agency of the
Future / Millenium cost and efficiency gains for the relevant periods.

“Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA divided by
Pro Forma M&A Adjusted Revenue for the relevant period.

“Pro Forma M&A Adjusted Revenue” means Adjusted Revenue as adjusted for the expected revenue impact of
closed acquisitions in 2021, acquisitions with signed share purchase agreement expected to close in the first half
of 2021, acquisitions under exclusivity expected to close in the first half of 2021, additional synergies from
acquisitions (from 12 to 18 months), capped transfer fee since June 1, 2020 and Agency of the Future /
Millenium cost and efficiency gains for the relevant periods.

“Recurring operating profit (loss)” includes all income and expenses directly related to our businesses, with the
exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses).” Recurring operating profit
(loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes
all items included in operating profit (loss), restated for any non-recurring items. Costs relating to business
combinations or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit (loss).

For a further description of certain of these non-IFRS measures, see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial
_Information and Other Data.”_

**As adjusted financial information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain as adjusted financial information including but not limited to:
as adjusted senior secured debt, as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total third party debt, as adjusted total third
party debt (including H1 Acquisition lease liabilities), as adjusted cash and cash equivalents and as adjusted
interest expense and related ratios, which are based on the consolidated financial information for the Group on
an as adjusted basis to reflect certain effects of the Transactions (as defined herein) on the indebtedness, cash
position and interest expense as of and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020. See “Summary—Summary
_Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary_
_Other Financial and Operating Data—Other financial data.” This adjusted financial information has been_
prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual interest expense would have been
had the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2020, or what our actual cash position, indebtedness or secured
indebtedness would have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2020, nor does it purport to
project our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at any future date. The adjusted financial information
has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the EU
Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any generally accepted accounting standards.


-----

Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information have
been audited or reviewed.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set forth in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in millions
or thousands, certain operating data or percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding
adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the
actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods
relating to financial and other data set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements of_
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this
Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**Percentage Changes**

We present certain percentage changes in this Offering Memorandum, including percentage changes set forth in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” on a nominal basis
and, as a result, the percentages presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be indicative of any decrease
between the numerical figures being compared.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding the market environment, market
developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which
we operate and compete. Unless otherwise stated, all information regarding markets, market position and other
industry data contained in this Offering Memorandum, are based upon our own estimates, publicly available
information, independent industry publications and reports prepared by a leading international third-party report
provider (“international report provider”).

We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding the real estate industry
are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data, statistics and other information are
inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such data,
statistics and other information are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective
judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and
transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of data and
statistics for different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently,
(ii) the underlying information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in
compiling the data and statistics.

Market data are inherently forward-looking and subject to uncertainty, and do not necessarily reflect actual
market conditions. They are based on market research, which itself is based on market data sampling and
judgments by the researchers about what types of products and competitors should be included in the relevant
market. Market data, statistics and other forward-looking information are subject to the same qualifications and
uncertainties as the other forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements.”_

We have not verified the figures, market data, statistics and other information used by third parties in the
studies, publications and financial information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates
are based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data, statistics and
other information from studies and third-party sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the
accuracy of third-party data on which our estimates are based.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data, statistics and information derived from such
data that cannot be obtained from publications by independent sources. Such information is partly based on our
own market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or
internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data, statistics and the information we have
derived from such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position
within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or verified externally.

While we assume that our own market observations are reliable, our estimates and information derived from
them and the market data, statistics and other information included in this Offering Memorandum should be
viewed with caution and no representations or warranty is given by any person, including us or the Initial
Purchasers, as to their accuracy. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from other
independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data
presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors,
including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, neither
we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information in this Offering Memorandum.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty in the global and French economic environment
and the industry in which we operate. Certain reports and publications from which we have obtained industry
and market data, statistics and other information that are used in this Offering Memorandum may not reflect the
current or ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry. The market information derived from
an international report provider was prepared in August 2019. Therefore, the market and industry data from an
international report provider included in this Offering Memorandum may not accurately reflect certain aspects

**EXCHANGE RATES**

The following tables set forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period-end Bloomberg

calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank
indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate
is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates may differ from the
actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and other financial information
appearing in this Offering Memorandum. Neither Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represent that
the US dollar or euro amounts referred to below could be or could have been converted into US dollars at any
particular rate indicated or any other rate.

The average rate for a year, a month or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily Bloomberg
Generic Rates during that year, month or shorter period, as the case may be. On March 19, 2021, the exchange
rate between the US dollar and the euro was $1.1909 per €1.00.

**Overview**

We are the European leader in the residential real estate services (“RRES”) market, providing services to both
individuals (“business-to-consumer” or “B2C”) and businesses (“business-to-business” or “B2B”). We assist
our residential and commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with competitive and
comprehensive service offerings. Our RRES business is the leader in France, operating under the Foncia brand
through a unique network of over 500 branches. We also hold leading positions in Switzerland and Germany
and have a strong presence in Belgium and Luxembourg in which we operate under various brands through a
network of over 100 branches.

We have expanded our size and reach through bolt-on acquisitions and completed over 220 acquisitions since
2016. In addition to our successful M&A track record, our recent performance has been marked by
achievements in operations, digitization, and our IT and communications infrastructure. We believe our success
is the result of a unique integrated ecosystem of real estate services, which provides the opportunity for organic
growth via cross-selling of additional services with recurring revenues and external growth through bolt-on
acquisitions.

We operate an integrated business model across a wide range of real estate services and divide our real estate
services into the following businesses:

    - **Residential Real Estate Services (representing 60% of 2020 revenue) consisting of**

        - **Joint Property Management (representing 30% of 2020 revenue) through which we**
are mandated by landlords to manage jointly owned building areas and equipment.

        - **Lease Management and Renting (representing 30% of 2020 revenue) through**
which we manage properties on behalf of landlords and assist landlords and tenants
throughout their rental process.

    - **Real Estate Brokerage (representing 13% of 2020 revenue) through which we assist property**
owners and buyers throughout the real estate sales process.

    - **Ancillary Services (representing 6% of 2020 revenue) through which we provide services that**
are complementary to our RRES and Brokerage businesses, including insurance and
inventories services.

    - **Digital Services (representing 4% of 2020 revenue) through which we operate services**
relying on digital platforms such as online real estate valuation and brokerage.

    - **B2B Services (representing 4% of 2020 revenue) through which we provide real estate**
services to our commercial and institutional customers, as well as adjacent real estate services
such as insurance and diagnostics.

    - **International Services (representing 13% of 2020 revenue) through which we provide the**
full spectrum of real estate services through our international operations in Germany,
Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg.

**Our Strengths**

**_Sector leadership focused on strongest economies in Western Europe providing competitive advantages_**

We have established ourselves as a leader for residential real estate services in France, Switzerland, Germany,
Belgium and Luxembourg by delivering high quality, reliable and innovative services uniquely suited to the
needs of our customers. As of August 2019, we were the number one player in the French real estate services
market, with approximately 13% market share, according to an international report provider. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, we managed approximately 1.8 million dwellings in France, which is approximately two
times the number of dwellings managed by our next closest competitor according to publically available
information for the year ended 2020. Outside of France, we hold leading positions in Switzerland and Germany
and have a strong presence in Belgium and Luxembourg. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we operated
over 100 branches in these countries, which collectively accounted for 13% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

Our scale, operations and service offerings provide us with a clear competitive advantage. Our centralized
processes result in lower internal costs and enable improved customer service compared to our typically small,
individual-owned competitors. Our comprehensive range of innovative services, such as FONCIA 24/7 (our
assistance service for our joint property management customers), Prowen (our centralized energy service that
reduces client costs on gas and electricity), and Assurimo, (our real estate insurance service), differentiate us
from competitors. Our comprehensive network of over 500 branches covering all major French cities is one of
the largest offerings in the market and results in close proximity to our customers and the dwellings that we
manage; unique market positioning in negotiations with third-party repair and maintenance service suppliers
resulting in decreased costs; and financial resources that allow us to expand our customer portfolio through
acquisitions. We have been able to successfully enter markets through acquisitions and expanded our operating
geography, despite the regulatory and technological requirements that create barriers to participation in the real
estate services market. Our regional and national regulatory and real estate industry expertise and our leadership
team’s extensive experience in the real estate services industry are key to meeting and complying with such
requirements. Our strong reputation for quality and service and multi-branded strategy have also supported our
ability to grow in existing markets and enter new markets.

**_Loyal and diverse customer base and synergetic business model in a resilient market_**

Our large and diversified client base, integrated ecosystem of residential real estate services and high customer
retention rates drive a high level of recurring revenues (75% in the year ended December 31, 2020).

We have grown our diversified customer base to approximately 1.5 million dwellings in our French Joint
Property Management business and over 330,000 dwellings in our French Lease Management business as at
December 31, 2020. Through our synergetic business model, we are able to cross sell our services to our
diverse customer portfolio across our business lines, which in turn leads to further organic growth. For
example, our proven ability to cross-sell is highlighted by the high penetration rates of Assurimo, our
specialized property insurance brokerage unit (providing property insurance, homeowners’ insurance policies
and brokerage services) through which we currently provide insurance services to 61% of our French Joint
Property Management buildings. Similarly, we currently provide technical services to approximately 88% of
our Lease Management customers through our dedicated business, Constatimmo. We believe that we are well
positioned to target new customers, including B2B customers, given our knowledge regarding fulfilling
requirements for our B2C customers.

The addressable markets in which we operate are characterized by high outsourcing rates, with a high and stable
portion of joint property or condominium owners (85% in France) under external management, as of August
2019 using services like our Joint Property Management business. Property owners tend to rely on expert
services such as ours due to the volume of work and amount of legal and accounting know-how required to
directly interface with tenants and other counterparties. Moreover, landlords rarely switch leasing managers
during a tenancy, given the risks and costs involved in switching service providers and the limited potential
benefit. We believe that through the integrated ecosystem of high-quality services we consistently provide we
have established high customer retention rates, and long lasting customer relationships, certain of which last
more than 20 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we lost only 3.5% and 8.4% of customers from our
Joint Property Management and Lease Management businesses, respectively. Moreover, 36% of our customers
from our Joint Property Management business in France entered into contracts of three or more years and 24%
for two to three years for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to our broad and diverse customer base, we
are not reliant on any particular customer.


-----

According to an international report provider, the French property management market is estimated to be €12.2
billion in August 2019, of which €5.3 billion is captured by property management companies, with the rest
serviced in-house. The externally serviced property management market has grown by approximately 2%
annually between 2014 and 2019. This stable growth has been driven by population dynamics and the
construction of collective units. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow through acquisition of
customer portfolios, cross-selling of related services to our large client base and the addition of new revenue
opportunities for our existing services.

**_Strong and predictable cash flow generation_**

We have a track record of steady cash flow generation, driven by a high level of recurring revenues, which has
enabled us to establish a history of consistent deleveraging. Our trend of improving EBITDA conversion rates
has continued with a Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate, of approximately 76% for the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared to 71% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Despite our regular M&A
activity, our discretionary spend on acquisitions provides us with flexibility to manage our cash flow and reduce
our financial leverage. In addition, from 2016 to 2019, we reduced our total net leverage by approximately 0.6x
on average per year. Further, our business requires limited maintenance capital expenditures, (accounting for
approximately 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020), and is characterized by limited working
capital requirements.

Our revenue increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 up
from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our margin resilience is supported by an adaptable
cost structure for the more cyclical flow Brokerage business, as Brokerage salary costs include a significant
variable portion that is indexed on commissions. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 26.9%, 26.8% and 22.3%
for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Our recurring, stable revenue is in part due to our complementary business profiles across our branches,
experienced management and sales force teams, and fee-based services in connection with our Joint Property
Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses which accounted for 69% of our revenue in France
for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, our high proportion of recurring revenues (75% in 2020)
and balanced portfolio of services split between stock and flow businesses with limited correlation have
supported our resilience during adverse economic conditions, achieving a substantially stable performance in
2020 despite unprecedented government measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Continuous investments in operational improvement through our innovative technology platforms reinforces_**
**_our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains_**

We continuously invest in cutting edge technology in order to offer the best multi-channel services to our
customers. Since 2017, we have upgraded a significant portion of our IT and communication infrastructure
including utilizing a mix of integrated and outsourced solutions, transitioning to a single telecom provider, and
streamlining our finance and human resources functions with Workday, which enabled us to quickly and
effectively transition to a work-from-home environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also
leveraged our technological know-how combined with our knowledge of the real estate industry to design and
launch a go-live version of our new ERP system, Millenium, which we have piloted at one of our branches in
France in 2020. Millenium integrates all of our IT and resource planning functions into one database to better
meet our customers’ needs and address internal business challenges. Millenium increases the digitization of our
activities with the aim of helping customers by creating greater transparency and improving our operations with
standardized, digital processes to increase efficiency and to improve the speed at which we can serve our
customers. We believe our high levels of investment in IT for our corporate platform and customer interface
service such as over recent years give us a competitive edge in the current environment.

The digitization, standardization and automation offered by Millenium complement our already synergetic
business model and will allow us to more quickly leverage our customer database to identify cross-selling
opportunities leading to greater operating efficiencies and inter-business synergies. We believe that
Millenium’s compatibility with big data, AI and IoT, will allow us to explore new business opportunities and
provide access to a number of revenue-enhancing opportunities. For example, we are developing a new
operational model called “Agency of the Future” which will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real
estate services and aims at improving client satisfaction and reducing our customer churn rate, which we believe
will, in turn, lead to greater opportunities for organic growth. In addition, we believe that the gains of
Millenium and the development of Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in
2022. We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technology to continually improve our internal


-----

operations in order to provide our customers with product offerings that meet their needs and make us the
number one choice among residential real estate service providers.

**_Consolidation platform with proven track record of executing value accretive acquisitions to drive_**
**_incremental EBITDA growth_**

In addition to our organic growth, we maintain a successful, low-risk strategy of growth through small, bolt-on
acquisitions. We completed 220 acquisitions from January 2016 to December 2020, which represented
approximately €386.0 million of acquired revenues (including gross revenues for Leemo netted for commissions
to agents in our financial accounts). In the year ended December 31, 2020, we made 61 acquisitions in our
primary French market and in other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management
dwellings and approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings and approximately €111.0
million of acquired revenues. We completed 61 acquisitions which contributed to our Adjusted EBITDA that
reached €286.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €258.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Consolidation is a natural trend in the highly fragmented markets we operate in,
accelerated by increasing regulations, and we play a key role in the market by defining new quality standards
and unrivalled execution processes. We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is dedicated
to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our five geographical
regions. Our long-standing integration experience, including a dedicated post-acquisition integration team,
enables us to extract full synergy potential from acquired businesses, with both cross-selling and cost synergies.
We have identified a number of potential targets in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg to
continue growing and, importantly, reinforcing our leadership in the market.

**_Highly experienced management team with proven execution capabilities and focus on growth and value_**
**_creation_**

Our management team, led by our Chief Executive Officer, Philippe Salle, have significant experience in the
industry and proven track record of delivering business and revenue growth, executing investment plans, driving
continuous improvement of our European enterprise and generating high returns on capital. Our management
team comes from various industries and geographies and is supported by five heads of region, who have
extensive experience in real estate and enable us to provide our customers with tailored expertise and service.

We believe that the collective industry knowledge and leadership of our management team positions them well
to continue our successful organic and external growth and execute our strategies. Further, our management
team encourages growth through a focus on operational efficiency and innovation including through the
management’s dynamic external growth policy that enabled us to, among others, establish our market leading
presence in Germany, successfully divest our non-core businesses to focus on our core, synergetic businesses
and more recently, by the ongoing overhaul of our IT infrastructure, including the development of Millenium
and enabling our planned transition to our new operational model, “Agency of the Future.” This is
demonstrated by the consistent increase in our revenues which increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (€1,013 million excluding the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic) up from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Our Strategies**

**_Industry-leading technology to further reinforce our competitive advantage_**

We are committed to providing the best real estate services offerings to our customers by investing in industryleading IT and data platforms, which in turn supports our market share gains. Our most recent digital
innovation, Millenium, an in-house developed ERP system that is device-agnostic, cloud-based and driven by
artificial intelligence, will allow us to fully digitalize all of our businesses and establish a highly personalized
digital relationship with our customers. We believe that Millenium will also allow us to better, more efficiently
serve our customers, cross-sell across our platforms and therefore capture greater market share from existing
customers and generate business from new customers.

Our IT and data platforms are subject to a process of continuous improvement and innovation, which we support
with ongoing investments, such as the team of over 80 developers and specialized professional we hired to
create Millenium. We believe that our robust investments in our IT and data platforms provide us with a
significant competitive advantage, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses have been
required to transition to a work-from-home environment. Additionally, our ongoing and historical use of big
data, AI and IoT to create new business opportunities enables us to maintain a cutting edge development


-----

program while minimizing the risks traditionally associated with experimentation. For example, we are in the
process of developing our new operational model, Agency of the Future, which we believe will generate
significant savings, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and
back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time
spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain
tasks that were previously done manually, such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges. Since 2018,
we have invested approximately €100 million into our IT projects, and we believe that the gains of Millenium
and Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in 2022.

We have developed, and continue to develop, innovative solutions based on emerging trends that are aimed at
providing our customers with the highest quality, optimal solutions for their real estate needs. We are constantly
looking for ways to improve our offerings and develop new solutions for our customers, which we expect to
drive incremental growth and positively impact our revenue.

**_Continue to drive organic growth and pursue targeted and opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions in core French_**
**_market_**

Our goal is to continue to deliver organic growth in France. We have been successful in achieving incremental
organic revenue growth through active cross selling efforts across our ancillary services. We intend to continue
to benefit from this growth through expanding our service offerings by introducing new business lines. In
addition, we aim to reduce our customer churn rate further by improving client satisfaction, including as a result
of the overhaul of our IT systems.

In addition, we have made, and intend to continue to make, bolt-on acquisitions in our core French market and
the other geographies in which we operate to supplement our organic growth, solidify our current market
position and expand our presence. We have a strong track record of successfully identifying, completing and
integrating opportunistic acquisitions. From January 2016 to December 2020, we completed approximately 220
acquisitions. We believe that our strong brand, broad platform and our dynamic infrastructure have allowed us
to generate growth and operating cash flows through acquisitions. Recent examples of targeted acquisitions in
France that have accelerated our growth and have allowed us to better address customer needs include Gérance
de Passy and LoftOne, in our RRES business, Yxime and Perial in B2B and in the German B2B segment, Paul
Immobilien and SogerTec. We intend to continue to further strengthen our strong position in the market by
pursuing opportunistic acquisitions in our existing geographies to accelerate our growth, and we aim to do so by
leveraging our internal expertise.

We have an M&A team that is dedicated to identifying growth opportunities. Our team deploys a disciplined
and systematic approach and focuses on opportunities that will enhance the offerings and services we provide in
France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg.

**_Continue to grow internationally_**

We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our geographic footprint in Europe, organically and through
targeted and opportunistic acquisitions. We intend to leverage our expertise and know-how as well as our
highly localized real estate providers to penetrate European markets where there is an unmet demand and an
opportunity for further expansion, as evidenced by factors such as population dynamics and the construction of
collective units, accompanied by increases in price and service level and a higher degree of outsourcing driven
by regulatory changes. We strategically pursue new markets while remaining committed to expanding in
France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg as these markets offer us proximity to existing
customers and expansion opportunities in countries where we have established brand recognition. We also plan
to enter European markets, where we believe local markets have strong fundamentals, such as the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Scandinavian countries, Austria and various other Eastern European
countries where we aim to become the market leader. Our expertise and solutions are scalable from region to
region, and we believe that as we continue to expand, we can increase market share by deploying practices and
strategies that have proven to be successful in other markets.

**_Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Leadership_**

We are committed to ESG matters and providing a safe and healthy environment for all of our customers and
employees. Our corporate social responsibility strategy is based on the following key commitments: supporting
sustainable energy in the buildings and dwellings we manage, improving the well-being of our customers and
our employees and ensuring fair and non-discriminatory access to housing and assisting local communities. Our


-----

ESG initiatives are also focused on protecting the environment while also ensuring that our operations have
minimal impact on the environment.

We also aim to work with our clients, contractors and suppliers to improve efficiency, conserve natural
resources and reduce waste and emissions. We focus on energy transition of buildings under management by
developing services and solutions to enable our clients to renovate and finance their dwellings. In 2021, we aim
to ensure that all of our building managers are systematically trained to lead such renovation projects, partner
with clients and employees who demonstrate a commitment to the environment and reduce our carbon footprint.

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

Based on our management accounts, we estimate that for the month ended January 31, 2021 compared to the
month ended January 31, 2020, our revenue increased by approximately 7.3%, from approximately €74.7
million for the month ended January 31, 2020 to approximately €80.2 million for the month ended January 31,
2021. We estimate that our reported EBITDA for the month ended January 31, 2021 increased by
approximately 7.8% from approximately €17.1 million for the month ended January 31, 2020 to approximately
€18.5 million for the month ended January 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, we estimate that we had cash and
cash equivalents of €63.8 million.

While our operations have remained resilient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and we are fully operational
across all business areas, we expect some carry-over impact notably as a result of the November 2020 lockdown
in France during which fewer property transactions took place, which will be reflected in our first quarter 2021
financial statements, in line with the customary three month lag between signing of brokerage transactions and
revenue recognition upon closing. This impact is expected to primarily affect the results of our Joint Property
Management (mainly on our additional fees) and Brokerage businesses.

_Joint Property Management_

In the one month ended January 31, 2021, we estimate that our Joint Property Management business revenues
increased by 7% compared to the one month ended January 31, 2020 to €25.3 million. For more information,
see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_

_Brokerage Business_

In the one month ended January 31, 2021, we estimate that our Brokerage business revenues decreased by 3%
compared to the one month ended January 31, 2020 to €9.9 million. This decrease was primarily related to the
November 2020 lockdown in France and due to property viewings being limited as fewer customers purchased,
rented or sold properties. We expect that the impact of the November 2020 lockdown will be reflected in our
2021 financial statements because we recognize revenue in our Brokerage business up to three months following
the signing of a transaction. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic_
_impact on our business.”_

_The information presented above relating to our performance for the one month ended January 31, 2021 is_
_derived from internal management accounts. This information has been prepared by management of the Senior_
_Secured Notes Issuer. It has not been audited, reviewed or verified, and it is not subject to any procedures by_
_our auditors, and you should not place undue reliance on it. While we believe this information is preliminary, it_
_is subject to change, and those changes could be material. This information may not be indicative of our_
_performance in the remainder of the financial quarter, the financial year or any future period. See_

The New Senior Credit Facilities will be secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral on a first-ranking basis, pari passu with the

Collateral will also secure the New Senior Credit Facilities on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes. The Post-Closing
Collateral includes, among other security, pledges over the shares of the Pledged Opcos. The Pledged Opcos do not provide a
guarantee and the share pledge over such Pledged Opco does not constitute a debt obligation of the Pledged Opcos but rather a security
interest in the shares of such entities and, upon enforcement, creditors could take control of the Pledged Opcos and sell the property
and assets of such Pledged Opcos to satisfy their direct obligations and their indirect claims. As Noteholders are not direct creditors of
the Pledged Opcos, the Noteholders’ claims are structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of any Pledged Opcos,

(a) In the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2020, the consolidated
statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019 and the consolidated income statement and cash flow statement for the year
ended December 31, 2019 were restated to give effect to application of the definitive decision of the IFRS IC and subsequent position
statement of the ANC on determining the lease terms of certain real estate leases. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain_
_changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—2019 Restatement” and note 3.2 to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s_
audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(b) Data for 2018 has not been restated to reflect the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16. We began applying IFRS 16 from
January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information. Under this approach,
a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted
for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. However, following additional analyses
carried out in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 15 (related to revenue from contracts with customers), in the year
ended December 31, 2019, we changed our accounting presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to
the reclassification of the contracts to be classified as contracts where we act as agent, as opposed to contracts where we act as
principal, as was previously the case, and the statement of profit and loss figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been
restated accordingly and net profit (loss) from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests was adjusted to correct a
minor presentation error. For further details see, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain changes in accounting standards and_
_accounting policies—2018 Restatement,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—Results of Operations—Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018” and note 2.7 to_

(1) Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. We define Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the IFRS-16 impact on

leases at our French and international premises and includes IAS 17 adjustments for leasing for vehicles, copy machines and laptops,
and also reflects the impact of certain asset disposals for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We adopted IFRS 16 on
January 1, 2019. As a result, we experienced an increase in EBITDA of €40.2 million and €36.0 million for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to rent costs no longer being incurred as operating expenses. Our EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2018 is already presented on a pre-IFRS-16 basis. We present Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA as additional information because
we believe it is helpful to investors in facilitating comparability of our results across the periods presented and evaluating the
performance of the underlying business. However, Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and
should not be considered as an alternative to measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

(2) Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin and EBITDA Margin is calculated as Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA and EBITDA, respectively, divided by
revenue for the relevant period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, for pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin, total revenue was adjusted
for asset disposals.

(3) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures. We define EBITDA as net profit before net loss from discontinued
operations, Income tax expense, share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies, other financial income and expenses, net income
from cash and cash equivalents, cost of gross debt, non-recurring operating income (expenses) and elimination of net additions to
depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before asset disposal, completed
acquisition, minority interest and COVID-19 impacts. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as additional information because
we believe they are helpful to investors in highlighting trends and evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However,
other companies may present EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and therefore comparability may be limited.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative
to net profit as an indicator of our operating performance, profitability, liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in
accordance with IFRS. The following table reconciles net profit (loss) for the period to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods
presented.

(a) Represents the estimated pro forma impact, relating to lost revenue, offset by a decrease in personnel and external charges, from
the sale of Foncia Pierre Gestion, IPlus and Primalliance in the year ended December 31, 2019.

(b) Represents the estimated pro forma impact of closed acquisitions during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and

2018. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the target for the next 12 months, without double counting the
results already included in the relevant period, based on its historical data. The number reflects the estimated impact of the churn
and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model, which are calculated based on the
historical churn and cost savings we have achieved with prior acquisitions. These figures are diligenced in connection with each
acquisition and validated by our operational and regional teams who will integrate the target as part of their perimeter and track
the performance against budgeted figures. Most of the acquisitions are integrated within three to six months and are then part of
the organic perimeter of the Group. The types of synergies that are recognized in the first year following an acquisition, many of
which are recognized on day one, typically include target management costs if they do not stay with the business, staff costs
related to functions such as headquarters and accounting, advertising costs, non-recurring items such as recruitments fees and
subcontracting, and accounting adjustments such as for taxes and leases, which we record below EBITDA. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Senior Notes—The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to_
_satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances.”_

(c) Refers to our 50% owned subsidiary, Foncia Brette SA, which is consolidated in our Audited Financial Statements (without

giving effect to intra-group transactions).

(d) Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns. While our Joint Property Management and
Lease Management businesses have been relatively resilient as our employees were able to service customers from a remote
working environment; they did experience a slight fall in revenues due to impacts such as a reduction in transfer fees in Joint
Property Management and disruptions with the postal service, which led to delays in sending invoices and receiving fees in Lease
Management. We also experienced some offsetting effects such as government programs to supplement salaries for employees
who were unable to work as well as a decrease in headquarter costs and performance bonuses.

The following table presents the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EBITDA across our businesses for the year ended
December 31, 2020. For purposes of determining our Adjusted EBITDA, we have only included the €20.8 million estimated impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our recurring stock business lines as those are generally more stable and predictable. In addition, we also
estimate that we experienced a €10.3 million impact on our Brokerage and Letting business lines, which are primarily non-recurring
flow businesses. We calculated the adjustments by assessing our actual performance against our budgeted metrics for these business
lines based on historic performance, while taking into account offsetting effects such as government programs and cost savings, as well
as identifiable impacts unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have not adjusted our EBITDA for the impact of the Brokerage and Lettings business lines, which are our primarily non-recurring
flow businesses. Our Brokerage business line was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first lockdown from
March to May 2020. During this time, we were not able to recognize revenue due to the cessation of notary services, and the closure of
our agencies and the limited ability for people to move led to a reduction in new transactions. As a result of the restrictions imposed
during the second lockdown in France lasting approximately two months from October 30, 2020 (the “second lockdown”), the number
of new transactions was impacted, but not as significantly, and notaries were allowed to work, which enabled us to recognize revenue
during this period. The renting side of our Lease Management and Renting business is a transaction-based business that also
experienced a decline in revenue when the French government largely prohibited people from moving to new properties during the
initial lockdown and, to a lesser extent, during the second lockdown. Constatimmo, which performs diagnostic and inventory reviews,
experienced a similar decrease in revenue as a result of fewer lettings and therefore fewer individuals requiring its services.

For a more detailed description of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including the breakdown of lost revenue by
business line, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting
_results of operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_

The above information and adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. This
information has not been audited, reviewed or verified by our statutory auditors in accordance with any generally accepted accounting
standards and the resulting financial information, including our Adjusted EBITDA, are based on a number of assumptions that are
subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. In particular, the adjustments take into account our estimated lost revenue as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic based on our internal budgets and historic performance. This information is inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations in the absence
of the COVID-19 pandemic for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other
financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
_Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS_
_measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain_
_estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_

(4) Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. We define Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA
after giving pro forma effect to the estimated impact of closed acquisitions in 2021, acquisitions with signed share purchase agreement
expected to close in the first half of 2021, acquisitions under exclusivity expected to close in the first half of 2021, additional synergies
from acquisitions (up to 18 months), capped transfer fees since June 1, 2020 and Agency of the Future / Millenium cost savings and
efficiency gains. We present Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA as additional information because we believe it is helpful to
investors in highlighting trends and evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However, other companies may present Pro
Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and therefore comparability may be limited. This information does not
represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is made
occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as nonrecurring will not recur in the
future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial
performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net profit as an indicator of our operating performance,
profitability, liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

**Pro Forma M&A Adjusted** **EBITDA[(i)] ..............................................................................................** **319,919**

(a) Represents the pro forma EBITDA contributions of acquired entities that have closed in 2021, as if such acquisitions had closed
at the beginning of the period. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the target for the full year based on its
historical data and includes the impact of estimated churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to each acquired
company’s integration in our operational model, which are calculated based on the historical churn and cost savings we have
achieved with prior acquisitions. These figures are diligenced in connection with each acquisition and validated by our
operational and regional teams who integrate the target as part of their perimeter and track their performance against budgeted
figures. Most of the acquisitions are integrated within three to six months and are then part of the organic perimeter of the Group.
The types of cost synergies that are recognized in the first year following an acquisition, many of which are recognized on day
one, typically include target management costs if they do not stay with the business, staff costs related to functions such as
headquarters and accounting, advertising costs, non-recurring items such as recruitment fees and subcontracting and accounting
adjustments such as taxes and leases, which we record below EBITDA.

(b) Represents the pro forma impact of potential acquisitions where we have signed share purchase agreements and expect to close in
the first half of 2021, as if such acquisitions had closed at the beginning of the period. This adjustment corresponds to the
estimated EBITDA of the acquisition for the full year based on its historical data and includes the impact of the estimated churn
and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model. These figures are calculated on
the same basis as described in footnote (3)(a) above.

(c) Represents the pro forma impact of potential acquisitions that we have under exclusivity arrangements and expect to close in the
first half of 2021, as if such acquisitions had closed at the beginning of the period. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated
EBITDA of the acquisition for the full year based on its historical data and includes the impact of the estimated churn and the
full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model. These figures are calculated on the same
basis as described in footnote (3)(a) above. Based on our M&A track record since 2016, we have a 95% success rate for closing
an acquisition when we have a transaction under an exclusivity arrangement. However, there can be no guarantee that the same
rate will materialize with respect to future acquisitions. For purposes of determining our Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, we
have only included €7.1 million out of the €12.9 million estimated impact from the total number of acquisitions under exclusivity
which are expected to close in the first half of 2021.

(d) Represents additional further synergies and churn from acquisitions in the 12 to 18 months after the closing date, in addition to

those already considered in pro forma EBITDA figures in the first 12 months. These synergies include cost synergies related to
employee costs, rents, Millenium gains and other costs such as accounting, insurance, IT maintenance and legal costs, travel
expenses and bank fees and revenue synergies related to, for example, insurance implementation, the GLI guarantee and crossselling opportunities between our different divisions. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in
reliance on the information available to us relating to each individual acquisition and our judgments based on such information.
The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy
benefit estimates.

(e) Since June 1, 2020, transfer fees have been capped by the French government at €317 (excluding VAT) per transaction by the

French government. We estimate this will decrease the average transfer fee by €80, which results in a yearly impact of a loss of
€4.8 million on a full-year basis based on an estimated 60,000 transfer fee transactions. In order to offset this €4.8 million
impact, we have set up initiatives to increase the penetration rate of DSP (“Pré Etat Daté”) services in our Joint Property
Management business, which we estimate had a positive full-year impact of €2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
which results in an overall impact of €2.1 million for the year. The adjustment of €875 thousand corresponds to the estimated
negative impact of the decrease in transfer fees and gains from subsequent initiatives in first five months of 2020.

(f) Represents the estimated gains from efficiencies from the Agency of the Future project by 2022, following the deployment of our
new ERP system, Millenium. We are designing a new organizational model named Agency of the Future, which will be
implemented following the roll-out of Millenium in 2022. As a result, we estimate gains, mainly related to (i) staff costs
synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees, an increase in
productivity and reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitalization and
automation of certain tasks previously done manually (such as collection of reminder fees or postal charges). We have quantified
the impact of the plan by (i) identifying potential for productivity improvement, such as analyzing time spent by employees for
their principal tasks in a select number of agencies and identifying potential for improved processes after implementing these
projects, (ii) reinvesting and improving service quality by, for example, defining a goal for the joint property management and
lease management business and the principal tasks of managers and assistants and quantifying the reinvestment necessary in
specific roles in order to put this target organization in place and (iii) scaling of the network resulting from the options for
improvement of processes and required reinvestment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures in connection
with Millenium and Agency of the Future were €17 million. We anticipate capital expenditures of €19 million in the year ended


-----

December 31, 2021 for the development and the deployment of Millenium. By the end of 2022, we estimate approximately €15
million in gains as a result of efficiencies due to Millenium and Agency of the Future, with approximately €20 million nonrecurring costs related to those gains. We believe that, we will experience additional gains in the following years, as a result of
these projects. For more information, see “Business—Digital Transformation and IT Systems.” The above information and
adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. This information has not
been audited. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve for operational efficiency successfully could
result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected. For more information see, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Business and Industry—Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve for operational efficiency_
_successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.”_

(i) In evaluating Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, as an analytical tool, it is subject to certain
limitations. In particular, run-rate cost savings and synergies are unaudited and based on management estimates and assumptions
(including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forward looking in nature. We may not be able to achieve
these cost savings and synergies in a timely manner or at all. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties, including a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates of cost savings and synergies. It may not give an accurate
or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the periods presented and may not be
comparable with our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum,
and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding
these items proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be
able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our cost-saving measures. This
information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made
occurred and been fully integrated at the beginning of the period. The EBITDA of each of the relevant acquired companies may
not be representative of what the EBITDA of such entities would have been for the period, as the case may be, had the
acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated at the beginning of the period. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA_
_Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS_
_measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved_
_certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our_
_Business and Industry—The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the_

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the_
_following risk factors before purchasing the Notes. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the_
_only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently believe_
_are immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of_
_the possible events described below were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations_
_could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on_
_the Notes when due, respectively, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This Offering Memorandum_
_also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ_
_materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including_
_the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our_**
**_business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity_**
**_pressure, fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent declines in property sales and leasing_**
**_activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we serve._**

Periods of economic weakness or recession, rising interest rates, fiscal or political uncertainty, market volatility,
declining employment levels, declining demand for residential or commercial real estate, falling real estate
values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may
occur, may negatively affect the performance of our business. In addition, any of these events may have a direct
impact on our ability to collect payments that we are owed under our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de
_loyers impayés”) and occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”), which we offer to certain residential_
landlords and lessors, respectively. See “—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or
_tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which_
_may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_

Our results of operations are significantly impacted by economic trends, government policies and the real estate
markets in the countries in which we operate. These include the following: overall economic activity, changes
in interest rates, the impact of tax and regulatory policies, the cost and availability of credit and the geopolitical
environment. The performance of our RRES services depends on our ability to collect fixed fees, charge
variable fees for ancillary services, find tenants to bill transaction fees and collect rents. Our Joint Property
Management business model is composed of fixed fees and variable fees related to additional services that could
decline due to adverse economic conditions or administrative restrictions such as pandemic lockdowns.

Additionally, the revenue derived from the Lease Management side of our Lease Management and Renting
business is generally based on a percentage of rent collections from the properties we manage and, with respect
to the renting side of the Lease Management and Renting business, from the one-off fees we receive for each
new lease agreement entered into by our customers. The revenue generated by our business can be affected by
many factors, including: (i) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may
increase during distressed economic conditions; (ii) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing
generally and regionally; and (iii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during
economic downturns. If tenants are unable to pay their rents, we are unable to collect the fees that are typically
directly deducted from these rental payments. Adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory
uncertainty could also impact our Brokerage business as it may lead to a decline in property sales and/or a
reduction in sales prices, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in brokering such
transactions. Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty, as well as significant changes and volatility in the
financial markets, business environment and the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict
our future financial performance. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Macroeconomic and market conditions.”_

Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the UK entered into a transition period which terminated on
December 31, 2020, before which on December 24, 2020, the UK and the European Union agreed to a trade
deal (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”) which was ratified by the UK on December 30, 2020 and is still
subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. While it is
difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or
modified arrangements between the UK and the European Union could result in additional volatility in the
markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on consumer behavior. Brexit has created political


-----

uncertainty within the European Union, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic
growth in certain jurisdictions. It is possible that other members of the European monetary union could hold
similar referendums regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future.

Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global_**
**_economy and financial markets which could adversely affect our business._**

The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause significant volatility, uncertainty and
economic disruption. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations and
financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict,
including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have
been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and
actions taken in response thereto; the effect on our customers, our customer’s financial position and customer
and tenant demand for, and ability to pay for, our services; our ability to provide our services, including the
impact of travel restrictions and staff working from home; and any closures of our offices and facilities. The
COVID-19 pandemic had several significant effects on our business, including decreased demand for our
services as a result of the slowdown in the European economies in which we operate and our inability to offer
certain services as a result of government lockdown measures. In accordance with the decisions taken by most
European governments in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all premises (branches and
head offices) were closed to the public during the lockdown period in France, Switzerland, Germany and
Belgium, from approximately mid-March to mid-May 2020 (the “first lockdown”), as well as to employees
(barring exceptional cases). During that period, real estate agents were barred from traveling to sign mandates
or show properties and notaries were closed, which prevented any brokerage transactions from closing. For
further discussion on notary execution, see “Regulation—France—Hoguet.” Moving into new premises during
this period was particularly complicated, as only moves that could not be postponed could be carried out, which
resulted in reduced letting fees for the period. The first lockdown measures imposed on the French, Swiss,
German and Belgian population also negatively impacted our fee collection with an increasing number of
residential and commercial tenants not being able to pay their rent on time or at all, although the rents remained
owed as a matter of law. The lease management market was also affected as we collect a portion of rents via
check, and there were disruptions with postal service, which led to delays in sending and receiving invoices and
fees. For further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our various businesses, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_

The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions, and thus the disruption
caused by these factors could further impact some or all of our business divisions. The COVID-19 pandemic is
ongoing, and there is a significant risk of recurring outbreaks in affected countries, and possible future
mutations in the virus may prove difficult to contain. For example, many countries in Europe have reintroduced full or partial lockdowns in late 2020 in order to stem subsequent waves of higher infection rates.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or further lockdown measures could also adversely impact our ability to
deliver our services. We anticipate some continuing impact on our EBITDA and revenue at least through the
first half of 2021, but the impact may be longer lasting and we can offer no assurances as to when or if such
impact will end. Any of these events could cause or exacerbate the risks and uncertainties described herein and
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We have numerous local, regional and national competitors across all of our businesses and the geographies_**
**_that we serve, and further industry consolidation, fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant_**
**_future competition._**

We compete across a variety of businesses within the residential and commercial property services industry,
including management of jointly owned properties, rental management and lettings, property transaction
intermediation, specialized property insurance brokerage, technical due diligence and inventories and consulting
services for commercial and office properties, business-specific IT services, marketing of properties by blocks
or lots and technical maintenance. Although we are Europe’s leading providers of residential real estate
services, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies and businesses. Depending on
the geography, property type or business, we face competition from other residential or commercial real estate
services providers and investment firms, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional
lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms and consulting


-----

firms. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property
type or business than we have allocated to that geography, property type or business. In addition, future changes
in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors or further consolidation of the industry. For example,
increased regulation following the implementation of the 2014 French access to housing and urban renovation
law, l’accès au logement et un urbanisme rénové (“ALUR law”), and the increasing need to invest in the
digitization of services has led to the increased consolidation of a highly fragmented market. For further
discussion on the ALUR law, see “Regulation—France—ALUR.” Reaching critical scale is important for the
digitization and industrialization of processes in order to reduce costs and improve customer service. Our
industry is highly fragmented among regional, local and boutique providers. Although many of our existing
competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger or have
a stronger presence on a local or regional basis or in their primary markets. We are further subject to
competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar services to our commercial real estate
business, and it is possible that further consolidation in the residential and commercial real estate industry could
lead to much larger competitors in the geographies, property types and businesses that we serve. In addition,
disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and
require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies
and business model to effectively compete. Further, we also face competition from service providers, who may
have greater knowledge of their home markets, a better understanding of the specificities of regulations and
local legislation and established reputations in their region. There is no assurance that we will be able to
effectively compete, maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.

**_Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our_**
**_fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition or results of operations._**

Low demand for housing generally, or at a particular location due to economic, social or other conditions, may
lead to a lower demand for our services. Moreover, our customers’ tenants could experience a change in their
financial situation at any time, including as a result of global economic events, natural disasters and public
health or pandemic crises. Our customers’ tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew
their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy. Any of these
actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases, or expiration of existing leases without renewal,
and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated or expired leases. Although a significant portion of
our revenues are derived from “stock” businesses consisting of providing fee-based services to our customer
portfolio, the loss of income by our customers could hinder their ability to pay such fees. Moreover, while our
fees for our Joint Property Management business are expected to be paid by the landlords whether or not the
property is being rented or occupied by the landlord, for our Lease Management and Renting business, our fees
are paid only if the properties are being rented and paid for by the tenants. Therefore, lease terminations may
result in a decrease in fees that we receive. Additionally, even if the lease continues, but the tenant fails to pay
rent, we will not be able to collect our fees because they are automatically deducted from rental payments. We
also are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in the winter so the effect of non-payment may be
greater during that time because we will not be able to evict and re-let the property as quickly as during other
times in the year. See “Regulation.” In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays
in enforcing our rights and may incur substantial costs in protecting our customers and re-letting their property.
If commercial leases are terminated or defaulted upon, it may be difficult to find a tenant to whom the property
can be re-let.

We also offer a rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés”) to certain residential landlords who have
entrusted us with the management of their property. Under this guarantee, we bear the cost of any unpaid rent
and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and thus
represent a risk of non-recovery.

We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”) to a small number of lessors to protect against
vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected apartments in new buildings.
As a result, we may bear the cost of any unoccupied properties under this guarantee. For example, the quantity
of unpaid rent typically increases during the winter months when we are prohibited from evicting people under
French law, and thus it is possible that we may experience an increase in loss of revenues if we are unable to
rent such properties. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, our stock increased temporarily as it
built up when we were unable to process disputes and evictions as a result of the first lockdown restrictions. In
this case, the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant increase in unpaid rent or defaults, however,
we cannot ensure that our revenues will not be negatively impacted as a result of future lockdowns or other
COVID-19-related disruptions.


-----

There is no assurance that we will receive payments that we are owed under our rent payment and occupancy
guarantees; therefore, both represent a large source of potential risk. Moreover, the occurrence of any of the
situations described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations. For information about our guarantee programs, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Rent payment_
_and occupancy guarantees” and “Business—Our Businesses—Residential Real Estate Services (France)—Lease_
_Management and Renting.”_

**_Our ability to grow our business relies significantly upon our acquisition strategy and there can be no_**
**_guarantee that sufficient or appropriate acquisition opportunities will be available to us, that we will be able_**
**_to close any or all acquisitions under purchase agreements, exclusivity arrangements or letters of intent, or_**
**_that financing will be available on acceptable terms._**

A significant component of our growth over time has been generated by acquisitions. We routinely explore
acquiring other businesses and assets, and in the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed 61 acquisitions.
We plan to continue to expand our business externally through similar acquisitions depending in part upon the
continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and
conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient funds from our cash on hand, cash flow from
operations, existing debt facilities and additional indebtedness to fund these acquisitions.

The number of acquisitions we pursue largely depends on the quality of the potential target and a key point of
focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary reason we decline to pursue a target after
entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of the target’s client accounting. The success of our acquisition
strategy depends on the ability of our senior management to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to
accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of
such acquisition candidates, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals from regulatory bodies and to
integrate the operations of such businesses once they are acquired. Our success in making additional
acquisitions depends on the availability of, and competition for, suitable acquisition candidates. Further, we
may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including any misjudgment of
the key elements of an acquisition, quality of client accounting, competition among buyers, the high valuations
of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, lack of internal resources to actively
pursue all attractive opportunities and availability of capital. Even after entering into a share purchase
agreement, exclusivity agreement or letter of intent, there can be no assurance that such acquisition will close
until such transactions are finalized, which may also impact the Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering
Memorandum. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present information
_relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma_
_Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum;_
_certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and_
_judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_

When we do identify and complete acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial and operational challenges,
including diversion of management attention and resources needed for existing operations, difficulty with
integrating acquired businesses, acquiring businesses that are not consistent with our long-term strategies,
integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, potential dilution of our brand, assumption of
unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial
systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities.

We have historically financed acquisitions through a variety of sources, including our own cash reserves and
debt financing. While we intend to continue to finance acquisitions from these sources in the future, we may
have insufficient cash reserves to fund acquisitions, and adverse market conditions or other factors may prevent
us from obtaining debt finance on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to implement our acquisition
strategy, obtain sufficient financing or integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business and prospects for
growth could be negatively affected. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions_
_and disposals.”_


-----

Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot
guarantee the successful implementation of our acquisition strategies. Additionally, our strategies may put
operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing
business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may
be unable to recover our investment or this may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future
acquisitions or we may face unforeseen costs or liabilities. In the past, we have grown through a combination of
organic development and bolt-on acquisitions, and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Growth
through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of the
acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations.

Our ability to realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisition activities, including any anticipated sales
growth, cost synergies and other anticipated benefits, will depend in large part upon whether we are able to
integrate such businesses efficiently and effectively. Integration is an ongoing process, and we may not be able
to fully integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected.
Successful integration of acquired businesses will also depend on our ability to effect any required changes in
operations or personnel and may require capital expenditures or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. The
integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including the following:
liability related to the mishandling of customer cash accounts; difficulty in integrating the acquired businesses in
a cost-effective manner, including the full integration of the acquired business account management into our IT
system, management information and financial control systems; unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor
or other issues arising out of the acquisitions; significant unexpected liabilities or contingencies arising from the
acquisitions; potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by our senior management’s focus on the
acquired companies; and post-acquisition performance not meeting our expectations or plans. We are required
to have separate customer accounts in our Joint Property Management business, and if a target has poor
customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances or complying with
applicable law. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions will be made on appropriate terms or at
an acceptable cost or can be successfully integrated with the rest of our businesses. A failure to identify
appropriate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Our failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies of past or future acquisitions could result in the lack of
implementation and achievement of our growth strategy may prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the
acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations.

**_A failure to appropriately address actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our_**
**_businesses._**

Our company has different businesses and a broad customer base and is therefore subject to numerous potential,
actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential customers. For
example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both landlords and tenants in residential real estate
lease transactions or our Brokerage business could have inside information about a property or the property
owner’s circumstances relative to other brokers as a result of our managing that property through our RRES
business. In certain cases, we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our customers. We have adopted
various policies, controls and procedures to monitor, address and limit actual or perceived conflicts, such as an
officer in charge of our risk management team, anti-bribery software, a whistleblower hotline and data
compliance procedures, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate or may not be adhered to by our
employees.

Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged
and cause us to lose existing customers or fail to gain new customers if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify,
disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that in
some jurisdictions, regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even
with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets. We cannot guarantee that future
conflicts of interest will not cause material harm to us.

**_We are subject to various risks related to managing large numbers of residential properties, and our failure_**
**_to effectively perform property management functions or to effectively manage our portfolio and operations_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

As of December 31, 2020, we managed approximately 48,000 buildings and approximately 1.5 million
dwellings in France under our Joint Property Management business and approximately 330,000 dwellings in
France under our Lease Management and Renting business. It may be difficult for us or our agents (including
real estate brokers and subcontractors hired by other third parties we engage) to regularly inspect such properties
and manage the maintenance and upkeep on behalf of our customers and to ensure compliance with regulatory
requirements. Additionally, we may find it difficult to manage tenants if they encounter difficulties with the
properties they rent. For example, although there are certain basic necessities that must function properly, such
as heat or water, we cannot force a landlord to comply with all tenant requests if they are not mandated by law.
Therefore, a tenant may have an unfavorable view of us as property manager for unresolved requests that the
landlord will not approve or if they are unhappy with the quality of work commissioned by the landlord, which
can present a risk to our reputation. The occurrence of any such development could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our ability to perform the property management services will be affected by various factors, including, among
other things, engaging the appropriate subcontractors, maintaining sufficient personnel and retaining key
personnel at the number of our properties that we manage under our Lease Management and Renting and Joint
Property Management businesses. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting
and retaining skilled personnel, in integrating any new personnel into our organization or in engaging with the
appropriate subcontractors at reasonable costs.

Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory
compliance and service quality and maintain other necessary internal controls. Our inability to effectively
perform the property management services on the properties managed by us as part of our Lease Management
and Renting and Joint Property Management businesses, or to effectively manage our portfolio and operations,
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_We may not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings, gains and synergies, which would have a negative_**
**_effect on our results of operations._**

In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and significant bolt-on acquisitions,
and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize
from these bolt-on acquisitions may differ materially from our estimates. The estimates contained herein are our
current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual
results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. Our ability to realize the expected cost savings, gains and
synergies associated with the adjustments included when calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA and other non–IFRS financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating
difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general
economic or industry conditions. We may be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings,
gains and synergies, and these costs are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.
We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies will not be
higher than we anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings, gains and synergies within
12 months of the completion of the respective acquisitions, and may not do so at all. Further, our churn rate in
respect of the bolt-on acquisitions may be higher than expected. Accordingly, you should not view our
presentation of this adjustment in our Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that
we will achieve these cost savings or gains. Our ability to realize these anticipated gains and synergies is
subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our
anticipated results.

In addition, any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by
reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take. For
example, reducing sales, marketing and customer support could result in lower revenue and could lead to
disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in employee productivity,
weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier
relationships. Further, no third party, including our independent auditors or any of the initial purchasers, has
performed any assurance procedures or expressed an opinion with respect to these estimated cost savings or
gains, or their respective achievability. As a result, our future performance may differ significantly from the pro


-----

forma financial information set forth herein. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—
_Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary Other Financial and Operating Data——Other_
_Financial Data.”_

**_We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted_**
**_EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this_**
**_Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved_**
**_certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them._**

The Offering Memorandum includes certain statements and figures relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
Margin and other non-IFRS measures. Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA and other metrics calculated using
Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA include estimated results of acquired businesses assuming such
acquisitions were made at the beginning of the period presented. We calculated such figures using third-party
quality of earnings assessments and the information and records available from the acquired businesses, which
in certain instances was based on unaudited financial information or management schedules and therefore
required significant assumptions and estimates, may not be up to date or may not be prepared on the same basis
on which we prepare our accounts. While these figures are based upon the latest available financial information
from the acquired business at the time we built each business case, actual figures may differ. Moreover, we can
offer no assurances that any anticipated acquisitions will close or that we will recognized our estimated cost
savings or efficiency gains. In addition, Pro Forma Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma M&A
Adjusted EBITDA also gives effect to the impact that the COVID–19 pandemic had on our business in the year
ended December 31, 2020. This adjustment is for illustrative purposes only. While we believe these estimates
and assumptions to be reasonable, some or all of this information may prove to be inaccurate or incomplete. As
a result, you should not unduly rely on such information in making an investment in the Notes. See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our ability to grow our business relies significantly_
_upon our acquisition strategy and there can be no guarantee that sufficient or appropriate acquisition_
_opportunities will be available to us, that we will be able to close any or all acquisitions under purchase_
_agreements, exclusivity arrangements or letters of intent, or that financing will be available on acceptable_
_terms.”_

**_We may be unable to effectively manage our growth into new geographies._**

Our growth plan includes expansion into new or recently entered regions, particularly in Europe. Expanding
into these geographies involves significant expenditures, over a period of several years, hiring and training of
personnel, and marketing efforts to introduce our brand to the new geography. We may not accurately predict
such costs or accurately anticipate operational difficulties caused by local conditions, and therefore may not
achieve our financial and strategic objectives for our operations in the new geographies. Accordingly, we may
incur losses as we expand our operations. Some examples of the risks encountered in entering new regions
include:

    - increased investment associated with understanding new geographies and following trends in
these areas in order to effectively compete;

    - increased costs associated with adapting our products and services to different requirements in
the local markets areas, which may decrease our margins and profitability;

    - challenges relating to developing and maintaining appropriate understanding and complying
with new regulatory schemes;

    - reduced ability to predict our performance because we will have less experience in the new
geographies than in our existing geographies; and

    - political, regulatory and other local risks.

To the extent we are not able to effectively manage our growth into new geographies, our financial results could
be adversely impacted.


-----

**_Our brands and our reputation are key assets of our company, which will be affected by how we are perceived_**
**_in the marketplace._**

Our brands and their respective attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our
ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands. Our ability to attract and retain customers is
highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices,
management, workplace culture, financial condition, our response to unexpected events and other subjective
qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, even if related to seemingly isolated
incidents and whether or not factually correct, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation
among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and
maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of
activities or circumstances, including the personal conduct of individuals associated with our brand, the
handling of customer complaints, regulatory compliance, such as compliance with anti-bribery, anti-money
laundering and corruption laws, the use and protection of customer and other sensitive information, and actions
taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid,
widespread reputational harm to our brand.

Our portfolio of brands and our reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside
of our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to third-party providers, landlords or
property owners may be attributed to us, thus damaging our reputation and the value of the affected brand and
increasing the attractiveness of our competitors’ services. Also, business decisions or other actions or omissions
of our shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investments, result in litigation or
regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation and brands. Adverse developments with
respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory
or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.

The protection of our brand, including related trademarks, may require the expenditure of significant financial
and operational resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our portfolio of brands may not adequately
protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks. Even when we
detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks, we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks.
Any unauthorized use by third parties of any of our brands may adversely affect our brands. Furthermore, as we
continue to expand our business, especially internationally, there is a risk we may face claims of infringement or
other alleged violations of third-party intellectual property rights, which may restrict us from leveraging our
brands in a manner consistent with our business goals.

**_Failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to_**
**_changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market._**

Our business relies heavily on information technology, including on solutions provided by third parties, to
deliver services that meet the needs of our customers. If we are unable to effectively execute and maintain our
information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our
ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired. In addition, we make significant
investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies. For example, we are
in the process of rolling out Millenium, our new ERP system designed to digitize many of our services and lead
to operational improvements. Implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed
estimated budgets, and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being
realized according to anticipated schedules. If we are unable to maintain current information technology and
processes, or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, the execution of our business plans may be
disrupted. Similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our
business. Our payroll and compensation technology systems are important to ensuring that key personnel are
compensated accurately and on a timely basis. Failure to pay professionals the compensation they are due in a
timely manner could result in higher attrition. Failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure
that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve
positive business outcomes.

**_Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve for operational efficiency successfully_**
**_could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected._**

We have an operating framework that includes a disciplined focus on operational efficiency. As part of this
framework, we have adopted several initiatives, including development of our operational models including
“Agency of the Future” and Millenium, our new ERP system in development, workflow processes and systems


-----

to improve client engagement and outcomes across our service lines. Our ability to continue to achieve the
anticipated cost savings. gains and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject
to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic,
competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we are vulnerable to
increased risks associated with implementing changes to our tools, processes and systems given our varied
service lines, the geographic regions in which we and our customers operate and the number of acquisitions that
we have completed in recent years. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at
implementing changes, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, we may not achieve or
continue to achieve new operational efficiencies and as a result our business and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

**_We rely on key relationships with third-party providers to conduct our business._**

We rely on key relationships with third parties such as law firms, real estate brokers, administrative agencies,
notaries, postal services, technical contractors and our customer’s bank branches to conduct our business. If we
are unable to find and maintain reliable service providers, any failure by these third parties to adequately
perform certain services for us or the loss of these relationships could materially impair our business operations,
and reduce our cash flow, income and profitability. For example, the halting of notary activities in connection
with the first lockdown directly affected our brokerage activities. While our contracts with certain third parties
may provide for indemnification to cover damages resulting from failure to perform their obligations
satisfactorily, such indemnification may not fully cover our financial losses in attempting to mitigate their
failures or our losses to other parties or may not be received in a timely manner or at all.

**_We are subject to various litigation risks and may face financial liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as_**
**_a result of litigation._**

We are exposed to various litigation risks and from time to time are party to various legal proceedings that
involve claims for substantial amounts of money. We depend on our business relationships and our reputation
to attract and retain customers. As a result, allegations against us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of such
allegations, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects,
in addition to any financial impact.

As a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial and residential real estate services, we, and our
licensed professionals and independent contractors, are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and
standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us, our sales professionals or
independent contractors to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we brokered or
managed in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We are subject to claims by participants in real estate sales and leasing transactions, including French
associations representing tenants, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management
services, who claim that we did not fulfill our obligations, or by customers for whom we provided appraisal and
valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as having been negatively affected by our
appraisals and/or valuations. These consumer organizations representing tenants are able to organize class
actions in the real estate services market, which has been introduced by the French Hamon law, and file lawsuits
on behalf of tenants. For example, we are currently involved in claims against us for alleged losses brought on
behalf of lessees related to over charges for receiving notices to pay. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” We
could be subject to claims following the acquisition of a business or subject to audits and/or fines from various
local real estate authorities or regulatory agencies if they determine that we are violating licensing laws or
failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations.

In our residential property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide
services for our managed properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or
other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our customers may seek to hold
us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project
manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be
pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the customer relationship.

We engage with subcontractors to provide a large number of building staff in facilities that we manage, and as a
result, we face the risk of potential claims from such staff, such subcontractors.


-----

We also face employment-related claims as an employer with respect to our corporate and other employees, for
which we would bear ultimate responsibility in the event of an adverse outcome in such matters. We also face
claims related to our franchisees, with respect to the termination of our franchise agreements and other claims
which may arise related to such agreements.

Adverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes and related or other litigation could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to
the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage
procured and maintained by us. Further, we face the risk of claims of illness or injury relating to premise
liability given that we lease, manage and sell properties to our customers. Some of these litigation risks may be
mitigated by the commercial insurance policies we maintain. However, in the event of a substantial loss or
certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to
pay the full damages.

Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may
have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims held under insurance policies could
become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency, although we seek to limit
this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. Any of these events could
materially negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Finally, we are also subject, from time to time, to tax audits and challenges from relevant tax authorities. In this
respect, two entities of the Foncia Group are currently undergoing tax audits run by the French tax authorities in
respect of fiscal years 2016 to 2018 and 2016 to 2019 respectively. If any such challenges are made and are not
resolved in our favor, they could result in a decrease of our tax losses as well as additional tax liabilities and
thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

Our business is sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity. Additionally, the
revenue in all of our businesses is dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the
residential real estate market.

Disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our advisory services to investors, owners and tenants of
real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property. If our customers are unable to
procure credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer completed leasing transactions, dispositions and
acquisitions of property. In addition, if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to obtain favorable
financing, resulting in the lack of disposition and acquisition opportunities for our projects, our business may be
unable to generate incentive fees.

**_Interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair_**
**_our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and materially harm our_**
**_operating results._**

Our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and
network infrastructure. Our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by
disruptions to these systems or infrastructure. Our information technology and communications systems are
vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions,
computer viruses, cyber attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or
terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control. With respect to
cyberattacks and viruses, these pose growing threats to many companies, and we may be a target of such threats,
which could expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm
to our business and financial results. In addition, the operation and maintenance of our systems and networks is,
in some cases, dependent on third-party technologies, systems and services providers for which there is no
certainty of uninterrupted availability. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss,
corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property or disruption of our ability to provide services to
or interact with our customers, contractors and vendors, and we may not be able to successfully implement
contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We could also face difficulties in bringing the IT
systems of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our standard security procedures and protections,
which could lead to interruptions or failures of our information systems.


-----

Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to
customers, business partners and other third parties. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans
and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning
may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the
destruction or disruption of any of our data centers, our critical business or information technology systems
could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating
results could be materially adversely affected.

Our business relies heavily on the use of software and residential real estate data, some of which is purchased or
licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. A disruption of
our ability to access such software, including an inability to renew such licenses on the same or similar terms, or
provide data to our professionals and/or our customers, contractors and vendors or an inadvertent exposure of
proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be
adversely affected.

**_A material breach in security relating to our information systems could adversely affect us._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers and on our
networks, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, our customers’ sensitive data
and personally identifiable information of our tenants, employees, contractors and vendors. The secure
processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations.

Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our
information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation
costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. Unauthorized disclosure,
modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may
occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee
negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by
our in-house employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime
and/or state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part
because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet, and the increased sophistication and
activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of
which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Cybersecurity attacks are
becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software, phishing and spear phishing attacks, wire fraud
and payment diversion, account and email takeover attacks, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access
to data and other electronic security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks, including attacks that are not ultimately
successful, could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise
protected information or corruption of our data, and could also substantially damage our reputation. We have
experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including ransomware attacks by cybercriminals, and we expect
we may experience additional attacks in the future. Cybersecurity attacks like the ones we have experienced in
the past could have a substantial impact on our reputation with our customers, and stakeholders, and may have a
material adverse effect on our business.

An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure
could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement
actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Any person who
circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause
interruptions in our operations that could cause us to be unable to provide our services or operate our business,
which could damage our reputation. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches and other
cybersecurity attacks and may incur significant additional costs to address issues caused by any such breaches or
cybersecurity attacks. Our failure to prevent future security breaches or cybersecurity attacks, or wellpublicized security breaches affecting the internet in general, could significantly harm our reputation and
business and financial results.

**_Regulations related to a material breach in data security could adversely affect us._**

Certain laws, regulations and standards regarding data security affecting our customers impose requirements
regarding the security of information maintained by these customers, as well as notifications to persons whose
personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. Certain laws may also require us to protect the
security of our employees’ personal data. In particular, we are subject to the stringent requirements of the EU’s
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), violation of which carries substantial fines and grants individual


-----

data subjects the right to claim damages for rights violations. In addition, in connection with the processing of
personal data, we are also subject to French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on information technology, data
files and civil liberties as amended, which incorporates the provisions of the GDPR. A public authority, the
French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l’informatique et des Libertés) (“CNIL”), is
responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in France.

We cannot ensure that the confidentiality of such data and information will not be breached as a result of
cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, or that doubts may not arise regarding the security of the data and
information collected and managed by us. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and customer
demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of
compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such
modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the
rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. Any failure on our part to comply with
these laws, regulations and standards can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and
effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.

If customer confidential information or personal data that we maintain is inappropriately disclosed due to an
information security breach, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or
intentionally breaches our confidentiality policies or other controls or procedures with which we are responsible
for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may incur
substantial liabilities to our customers and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by governmental authorities.
Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification
claims with our customers and other parties and harm our reputation. In addition, any breach or alleged breach
of our confidentiality agreements with our customers may result in termination of their engagements, resulting
in associated loss of revenue and increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and
business. For further discussion on the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, see “Regulation.”

**_Our business may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which_**
**_our business depends or if we are subject to claims of intellectual property infringement._**

Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our
proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property, including the value of our brands. We rely upon a
combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and patent, copyright, and
trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. For example, certain of our business units rely on
proprietary software that we have developed internally or acquired, such as Millenium, or mobile apps
developed as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors
from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take may not be
adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors,
former in-house employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights
of third parties. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement,
misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld.

Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may be
necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to
defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine the scope and
validity of our or others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation,
and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may
prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights if we are not be able to obtain the necessary
licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property
rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient._**

We currently have general liability insurance and insurance for certain specific policies, such as cybersecurityrelated incidents, in place to cover liability to which we may be exposed from our business activities and certain
facilities, in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles
and do not include business interruption coverage. We may not be covered by insurance in specific instances,
such as fire, explosions, natural disasters, water damage and terror attacks. While we seek to maintain


-----

appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable, and we may experience major incidents of a nature
not covered by insurance. Furthermore, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative
development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general.
Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and
the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to
restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.

**_Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new_**
**_laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof. If we fail to_**
**_comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes,_**
**_we may incur significant financial penalties._**

We are subject to numerous European, national and local laws and regulations specific to the services we
perform in our businesses. Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of valuation
services requires us, and our employees, to maintain applicable licenses in certain countries in which we
perform these services. If we, and our employees, fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities
without a license, or violate any of the regulations regarding our licenses, we may be required to pay fines or
return commissions received or have our licenses suspended, cancelled or revoked.

In addition, the residential real estate industry and residential tenancies in particular remain heavily regulated
and closely monitored by consumer watchdog organizations and associations that can organize class actions and
file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. The latest major change came in 2014, with the introduction of the ALUR
law, under which the French government introduced, among others, measures to protect individuals considering
buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. A large amount of
extra documentation is now required before the pre-contract (compromis de vente) can be signed, which
increases the time between the initial offer and closing.

We must comply with law No. 89-462 dated July 6, 1989, which grants residential tenants a statutory right of
renewal and caps rents for vacant units and renewed leases at the amount of the last indexed rent paid by the
previous tenant and/or of a reference rent determined by the decree. This law also restricts a limited number of
landlords a right to recover service charges from tenants and requires residential leases to complete various
reports on the environmental status of the property or technical features of the premises. In addition, we are
prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in winter, from November 1 to March 31 each year. In 2021,
this period was extended in 2021 until May 31 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must also comply
with articles L.145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, recently modified by law No. 2014-626 dated June
18, 2014 known as the Pinel Law, for premises leased to commercial tenants. The French commercial leases
regime establishes various compulsory obligations establishing, amongst others, a minimum term of nine years,
a tenant’s statutory right of renewal on lease expiry, a cap on renewed rents and a limitation on service charge
recoverable from tenants.

We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental, employment laws,
anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, and occupational health and safety regulations. Failure
to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental
authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of
these matters.

As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past decade, both the difficulty of
ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting
from non-compliance have increased. The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and
legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which
we expect will continue into the future. New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business may
have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us
from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or
customers. For example, on May 25, 2018, GDPR became effective with a greater territorial reach than existing
laws, and it applies to all of our contracts and agreements throughout Europe. As a result, we updated and
continue to update certain agreements and data protection practices, which may take significant time and cost.

We are unable to predict how new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form,
or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or
implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and


-----

unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

**_Examinations and challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position_**
**_could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as international tax
laws. Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position,
including our effective tax rate or tax payments.

Our tax returns and the tax treatment of our transactions are prepared in accordance with applicable tax
legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we
have received in some cases from third parties, and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law.
These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards
enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief, withholding tax, franchise,
gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities
will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges
from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in
adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be
favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in
significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

In particular, European, Luxembourg and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are
subject to varying interpretations. In this respect, an increase in administrative efforts within our business and
an impact on existing structures may occur from the current incorporation into French and Luxembourg tax law
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base
erosions and profit-shifting (“BEPS”) that were included in the final reports released by the OECD and the
Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7,
2017.

The European Union intends to harmonize tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of
the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax
avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council
Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive
(EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches
involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions) from January 1,
2020. Among the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which
the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject
to several exceptions). Such rules apply from January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law.
The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also introduced under French tax
law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article
212-I-b of the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Each Series of Notes—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a_
_portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service_
_our indebtedness” for more details on these rules._

Furthermore, Article 108 of the 2019 French Finance Law introduced, under French tax law, the anti-abuse
provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax and aims to address abusive
tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French
tax authorities may ignore an arrangement or a series of arrangements which are not genuinely taking into
account all relevant facts and circumstances, having been put into place for the main purpose, or one of the main
purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law.

While the ATAD was implemented into Luxembourg domestic law by the law of December 21, 2018 and
entered into force on January 1, 2019, the ATAD 2 was implemented into Luxembourg domestic law by the law
of December 20, 2019 and entered into force on January 1, 2020, save for the reverse hybrid mismatch rule,
which will enter into force on January 1, 2022.


-----

The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016
including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base
(“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding
loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing
new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on
the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of
the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It is
expected to be implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and
consolidation being put in place swiftly afterwards. In this respect, the European Commission has published its
work program for 2020, which indicates that the CCCTB should receive priority attention this year.
Furthermore, additional rules on tax dispute resolution apply since January 1, 2019 following the transposition
of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the 2019 French Finance
Law. These regulations could impact our tax position in the future.

Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Group’s companies are located,
or operate, or may be located, or may operate, may not always provide clear-cut or definitive guidelines, the tax
regime applied to the Group’s operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations (past or future) is or may
sometimes be based on the Issuer’s interpretations of French, Luxembourg, or foreign tax laws and regulations.
We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities. More
generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which the Group’s
companies are located or operate may result in reassessments, late payment interests, fines and penalties.

**_Payments on the Senior Notes may be subject to penalties under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or_**
**_“FATCA” and the Common Reporting Standard or “CRS.”_**

Under the terms of the FATCA Law and CRS Law (as defined in section “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
_Luxembourg Tax Consequences”), the Senior Notes Issuer may be treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial_
Institution. As such, the Senior Notes Issuer may require all the holders of Senior Notes to provide documentary
evidence of their tax residence and all other information deemed necessary to comply with the above-mentioned
laws. The Senior Notes Issuer may become subject to penalties as a result of a non-compliance under the
FATCA Law and/or penalties as a result of a non-compliance under the CRS Law.

**_Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain_**
**_qualified and experienced employees._**

We are dependent on certain key employees and management personnel, the loss of whose services might
impede the achievement of our business development objectives. The departure of any of our key employees,
including our senior executive leadership, or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are
unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and
results of operations to suffer. Competition for these personnel is significant, and our industry is subject to a
relatively high turnover of brokers and front office Joint Property Management managers, and we may not be
able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Through the efficiencies created
through our new Millenium platform, we hope to streamline and simplify administrative tasks that may help to
retain front office and other staff, but there can be no assurance that this initiative will be successful. In
addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support
personnel in all areas of our business and IT personnel in particular. We and our competitors use equity
incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize senior management. As
competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may
increase, and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past. If
we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and
operating results could suffer.

**_Labor disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**

We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws applicable to our
business in certain countries, particularly France, are relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide
for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition, some of our employees are members of unions or,
based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform,
consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in managing,
developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could
limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to


-----

respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important
strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative
bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business.

Although we believe our relations with employees are good, our operations may nevertheless be materially
affected by strikes, work stoppages, work-slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the future, which
could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our employees in certain countries benefit from collective bargaining agreements, and we may not be able to
periodically renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened labor
disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in Switzerland, we
participate in employer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor
contracts. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with
provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. We could
be subject to claims arising under these plans, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business
and financial condition.

**_Our shareholders’ interests may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Our shareholders have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to
prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or shareholders, regardless of
whether the holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interest. For example,
our shareholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including
secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the Notes. In
addition, our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time,
acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also
pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value thereof._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in relation to our acquisitions. This amount of goodwill on
our balance sheet may further increase in connection with acquisitions we complete in the future. Total
goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses was €1,445.4
million as of December 31, 2020, or 39.6% of our total assets. We test annually whether goodwill has suffered
any impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline
in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations
(including changes that restrict our activities or affect the services we provide) and a variety of other factors.
Significant judgment is involved in estimating expected cash flows and fair value. Our estimates are based on
historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading
multiples. Such charges may result in material reductions of our income and equity and could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_Changes to accounting standards may affect our reporting of our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. Any changes in
these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results from operations.
In particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain
IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB. Notably, the effectiveness of IFRS 16 (Leases) from
January 1, 2019 has an impact on the manner in which we carry out our financial reporting. The application of
IFRS 16 has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our reported assets, liabilities and income statement as
we will recognize new assets and liabilities for our operating leases. We chose to apply IFRS 16 using the
modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative information, which means that our data for
the year ended December 31, 2019 cannot be meaningfully compared with data for the year ended December 31,
2018. Under this approach, a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual
lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the
lease commencement date. We have a large number of leases, primarily leases of property and vehicles, across
our entire French and international branch network. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial


-----

_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—_
_Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—IFRS 16.”_

Further, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly
affect our financial results. IFRS and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and
interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited
to, revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, intangibles,
self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, litigation and equity-based compensation, are highly
complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or
their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could require us to make
changes to our accounting systems to implement these changes that could increase our operating costs, and
could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.

**_Weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal controls generally and over financial reporting may prevent us_**
**_from managing our growth effectively, reporting our financial results accurately or result in a material_**
**_misstatement of such results._**

The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls
could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, a lack of requisite personnel or
fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
all misstatements or fraud. We could also face difficulties in bringing the internal controls, accounting
procedures and policies of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our internal controls and
procedures in time for the reporting cycle following an acquisition, which could lead to inaccuracies or
misstatements in our financial reporting. If we cannot maintain or execute adequate internal control over
financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the
reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer
harm to our reputation, fail to meet our reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on
our business or our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_A portion of our revenue and cash flow are seasonal, which could cause our financial results and liquidity to_**
**_fluctuate._**

A portion of our revenue is seasonal, which impacts the comparison of our financial condition and results of
operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis and we are exposed to the more-cyclical real estate transaction market
through our brokerage activities. For example, we experience increased revenue in the month of May when we
file certain tax papers on behalf of landlords, and there is some increased revenue in our Brokerage business in
June and July, excluding year ended 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have historically relied on our
internally generated cash flow to fund our working capital needs and ongoing capital expenditures on an annual
basis. Our internally generated cash flow is similarly impacted by this seasonality, and this seasonal nature of
our internally generated cash flow could result in a mismatch of funding needs for working capital and ongoing
capital expenditures.

**_Our capital expenditure and other maintenance costs may be higher than expected._**

We must maintain and improve our information and technology system in order to remain competitive and to
generate revenue over the long term. Further, maintaining and improving our information and technology
system is essential to integrate newly acquired businesses. Maintaining a competitive information and
technology system can entail significant costs. Any failure by us to undertake appropriate maintenance of our
information and technology system could adversely affect our results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the_**
**_Note Guarantees._**

Following the completion of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of December 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had
total indebtedness (excluding other indebtedness amounting to €174 million consisting of outstanding lease


-----

liabilities, CICE pre-financing credit and borrowings under other bank financing facilities and deposits and
guarantees received ) in the amount of €1,925 million (equivalent), consisting of the Notes and the New Senior
Credit Facilities. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Other Indebtedness,” “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes.” We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for the_
foreseeable future.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

    - making it more difficult for each Issuer and their subsidiaries to satisfy their respective
obligations with respect to the Notes, the New Senior Credit Facilities and other debt and
liabilities we may incur;

    - increasing our vulnerability, and reducing our flexibility to respond to general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of
such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures,
product research and development, or other general corporate purposes;

    - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

    - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

    - increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged;

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital
expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and
increasing the cost of any future borrowings; and

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional capacity for issuance of bid, advance payment,
performance and warranty guarantees for operative business purposes and increasing the cost
of any future guarantee issuances.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
obligations, including under the Notes and the New Senior Credit Facilities.

**_Each Issuer is a holding company that has limited revenue generating operations and will depend on cash_**
**_from the operating companies of its respective subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the Notes and the_**
**_Note_** **_Guarantees._**

Each Issuer is a holding company with limited business operations other than management of the equity
interests each Issuer holds in their respective subsidiaries. Following consummation of the Transactions, each
Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow from their respective operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends
or other distributions or payments to meet their obligations, including their obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to each Issuer will depend on the
profitability and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries, and on the ability of each of those subsidiaries to
declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if
applicable. Each Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable
law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to each Issuer to make payments in respect of their
indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases, may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the New Senior Credit Facilities and


-----

the Senior Secured Notes limit the ability to upstream cash to the Senior Notes Issuer subject to certain
exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law, as well as
profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group, may also limit the amounts that some
of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent
such payments. In particular, the ability of each Issuer’s respective subsidiaries to pay dividends to each Issuer
will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay
their respective debt when due. The subsidiaries of each Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct
obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees.

While the Indentures limit the ability of each Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability
to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications
and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future, permitted under the New
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures, and part of such debt may also be secured by the
Collateral. The Indentures and the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial
amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes, and to incur indebtedness that shares in
the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our
subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do
not guarantee the Notes such debt is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of
such property and assets securing such debt, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes.
Although the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will contain restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance
with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to each Issuer and its respective subsidiaries’
existing debt levels, the related risks that each Issuer faces would increase. In addition, the New Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and
the Note Guarantees.

**_Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will be subject to restrictive covenants that will limit_**
**_our operating and financial flexibility._**

The New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures, as applicable, will contain covenants, which
impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements will limit our ability to, among
other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

    - make certain restricted payments and investments;

    - transfer or sell assets;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - create or incur certain liens;

    - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

    - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

    - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

    - take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes;

    - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and


-----

    - pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.”_ The
covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs
and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while amounts under the New Senior Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under
certain circumstances, the New Revolving Credit Facility under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will
require us to comply with a financial ratio, while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding
under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Credit
_Facilities Agreement.”_ Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio.
A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, including
our failure to comply with the financial ratio thereunder, could result in an event of default under the New
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under
the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of
indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the creditors under our New Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the New Senior Credit Facilities and elect to
declare all amounts outstanding under the New Senior Credit Facilities, together with accrued interest,
immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the New Senior Credit Facilities, including our
failure to comply with the financial ratio under the New Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions,
including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the New Senior Credit Facilities,
accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries
would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be
due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay
those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those
amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may_**
**_not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the New Senior
Credit Facilities and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans,
will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the
success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory
and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our
control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings, gains or efficiencies will be realized, or that future debt financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund
our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the New
Senior Credit Facilities. At the maturity of the New Revolving Credit Facility (which matures six months
before the Senior Secured Notes and 18 months before the Senior Notes), the Notes or any other debt that we
may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt
obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our
indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.


-----

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions
will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In
such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes and the New Senior Credit Facilities, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require
us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and
results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could
be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be
acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our
obligations.

**_Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the EURIBOR and LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect_**
**_the interest the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pays on the New Senior Credit Facilities._**

The New Senior Credit Facilities will bear interest at interest rates based on EURIBOR and/or LIBOR
(depending on whether a loan under those facilities is denominated in euro or sterling), which are deemed to be
“benchmarks” and have been the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals
for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms
may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other
consequences which cannot be predicted.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to
the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within
the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires
benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent
regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of
benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent
or recognized or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the New Senior Credit Facilities if the
methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the
Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or
otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of
the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase
the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with
any such regulations or requirements.

Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active
underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for market
participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has indicated
through a series of announcements that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be
guaranteed after 2021. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of
guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro
denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among
other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions)
may increase the risk to the euro area financial system.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will continue to
be supported going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and
may have other consequences which cannot be predicted., Such factors may have (without limitation) the
following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or
contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or
(iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential
changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a
sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the
interest we pay on borrowings under the New Senior Credit Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to
increase significantly, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.

**_The interests of our Shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Shareholders indirectly own substantially all of the shares of each Issuer. See “Principal Shareholders.”
Our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital
structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our
operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’
interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter
financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause
us to incur additional indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies
and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders
may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those
acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our shareholders and their affiliates could also have an
interest in pursuing divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our
shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might
involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_The Senior Secured Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 180 days after the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will not be secured by
all of the Collateral, as further described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” On the
Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only by the Issue Date Senior Secured Notes Collateral.
We will agree in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to take such necessary actions to secure the Senior Secured
Notes within 180 days from the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially
simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, by first-priority security interests in the
Post-Closing Collateral. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens
within the time periods specified, the failure of which would result in an “event of default” under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the New
Senior Credit Facilities and otherwise as set forth under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests,” which limitations_
could be significant. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes and the Note
_Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely_
_affect their validity and enforceability.” It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest granted by a_
Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee or
security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.”_

**_If the New Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of_**
**_the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, creditors under the New Revolving_**
**_Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be_**
**_incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking_**
**_pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility, are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the_**
**_enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will rank pari passu with our other senior
secured debt, including the New Senior Credit Facilities. The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions
governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Such enforcement
proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of
the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned over amounts and other recoveries by
the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations (including, among
others (following the designation of the New Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, after the date on which the New Term Loan Facility is refinanced
in full), those under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness that
may be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts
toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such Super
Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of
Senior Secured Notes Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been


-----

discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior Secured Notes (if the New Revolving Credit Facility
has not been designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
the New Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Senior Secured
Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior
Secured Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the
rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are secured on a first
ranking basis with security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that also secure our obligations
under the New Senior Credit Facilities, and a portion of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the Shared
Collateral, will also secure the New Senior Notes on a second priority basis. The Senior Secured Notes
Indenture also permits the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with
the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent will only enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to
take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect
of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority
hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total
Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case, acting
through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the
Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in
certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases,
creditors holding 50% of the total topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed
to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii)
creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the “Majority
Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior
Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged within six months of enforcement instructions first being
issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions
provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have
not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and
(ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing enforcement
instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to
enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds, and (y) deliver enforcement
instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles and necessary or
advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives before the security agent has
received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the
Security Agent shall act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super
Senior Creditors.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which
is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the


-----

instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior
creditors), or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided
such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds, or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities, or the exercise of any right, power, authority or
discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security
for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of the Group. In connection with any
enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or
prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees).

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Notes (such as indebtedness under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of
Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we
incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of
the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Senior Secured Notes Collateral
consisting of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an
enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the
liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents, or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the
Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Senior Secured Notes, you will be
deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors in the
event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges over shares of French_**
**_companies by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, consisting of shares_**
**_rather than by a sale of such Senior Secured Notes Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and
unpaid to it. The pledges over financial securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a financial securities
account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be
enforced at the option of the secured creditor, either by a sale of the pledged financial securities in a public
auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire) of the financial_
securities to the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged
financial securities. In a proceeding for attribution judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an expert is
appointed (whether contractually or by the court) to value the collateral (in this case, the pledged financial
securities), and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured
creditor is required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the financial
securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire or an
_attribution conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the_
foreclosed financial securities.

Consequently, in the event the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under
the New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt)
decides to, and is entitled to, enforce the financial securities pledges through a judicial or contractual foreclosure
and if the value of such financial securities exceeds the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the
Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as for the benefit of the lenders under the New Senior Credit


-----

Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) may be required to pay
to the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the value by which such financial securities exceeds the amount of
secured debt under the pledge.

If the value of such financial securities is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant
amount owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such financial
securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured.

If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Senior Credit
Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) declines to request the
judicial or contractual foreclosure of the financial securities, a sale of the pledged financial securities could be
undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions set
forth in the immediately following risk factor, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf
of the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor
of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged financial securities through a public
auction. Since public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern (as the
latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment
bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for
the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies), it is possible that the sale price received in
any such auction might not reflect the value of the Group as a going concern.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral that will be granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured indebtedness may_**
**_be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.
See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will
also secure the New Senior Credit Facilities and a portion of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the Shared
Collateral, will also secure the Senior Notes on a second priority basis. Not all of our assets will secure the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will allow the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
their restricted subsidiaries to secure any future Senior Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (which may be structurally
senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) with the property and assets of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The
value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees
will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other
unsecured indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and their restricted subsidiaries with respect to any
property or assets excluded from the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes.

While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and
grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or
creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security
Principles. The Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set
out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or
guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other
things, the amount recoverable under any Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided being limited or security not
being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect
the value of the security or guarantees provided by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under_**
**_certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be
sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No
appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering.
The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things,


-----

whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the
ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located
and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in
part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value
to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable,
that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in
which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses,
authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer
of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold
such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents,
enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain
jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged.
Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result,
enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured
Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the
amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our
subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such shares
may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the
entity’s shares that have been pledged, because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been
pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the
creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an
enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the
proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior
Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other
secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and
remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds
available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior
Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior Secured Notes would benefit
from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your
ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Notes**

**_The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt._**

The Senior Notes will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future
indebtedness that is expressly senior in right of payment to the Senior Notes, including our obligations in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes and the New Senior Credit Facilities. In addition, the Senior Notes will be
structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer
that do not guarantee the Senior Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors, and effectively
subordinated to all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by liens that do
not secure the Senior Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness.
In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt
ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Senior Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Senior
Notes on a pro rata basis with debt ranking equal in right of payment to the Senior Notes only after the senior
secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay
amounts due on any or all of the Senior Notes then outstanding. The Senior Notes Indenture will not prohibit us
from incurring additional secured debt, nor will it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional
liabilities.


-----

**_Your right to receive payment under the Senior Notes Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior_**
**_ranking debt of the Guarantors._**

The obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Senior Notes Guarantees are general senior obligations
of such Guarantors and will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all
existing and future obligations in respect of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor. Such debt includes the
guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes, and the obligations under the New Senior Credit Facilities. Although the Senior
Notes Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional
debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the Senior Notes Guarantees.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture in respect of an
insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the
assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Senior Notes Guarantees. Until the
senior ranking debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes
would be entitled, but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement, shall instead be
made to holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event
of insolvency of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor
may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Senior Notes
Guarantees.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Notes Guarantees
will provide:

    - customary turnover provisions (relating to certain specified amounts) by the Trustee and the
holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior ranking debt of such
Guarantor;

    - that if a payment default on any senior ranking debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is
continuing, Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Notes Guarantees
until such default is cured or waived;

    - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking
indebtedness that permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee
receives a notice of such default, such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the
Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Notes Guarantees, until (among others) the earlier of
the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment
blockage notice is received; and

    - that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent
of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking
any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee
will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes
Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict the rights of
holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the
Guarantors under the Senior Notes Indenture, and by accepting any Senior Note, each such holder will be
deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Notes will
have limited remedies and recourse under the Senior Notes Guarantees in the event of a default by the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture.

**_The Shared Collateral secures the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the New_**
**_Senior Credit Facilities on a first priority basis, and secures the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes_**
**_Guarantees on a second priority basis and, as such, your rights to recover on such Shared Collateral will be_**
**_limited._**

A portion of the Senior Notes Collateral, the Shared Collateral governed by French law, will be pledged for the
benefit of the Security Agent under the Parallel Debt (as defined below). Under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the New Senior Credit Facilities are secured by first
ranking security interests in the Shared Collateral and the proceeds of any sale of the Shared Collateral on


-----

enforcement will be applied first to repay all debt of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders
under the New Senior Credit Facilities and certain hedging obligations. Consequently, you may not be able to
recover on such Shared Collateral because the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the
New Senior Credit Facilities and counterparties to certain hedging obligations will have a prior claim on all
proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Shared Collateral.

**_The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral that will be_**
**_granted as security for the Senior Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not_**
**_secure the Senior Notes._**

The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral described in this
Offering Memorandum. See “Description of the Senior Notes—Security.” In addition, a portion of the Senior
Notes Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior Secured Notes and the New Senior Credit
Facilities on a first ranking basis, and may secure additional debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees. Although the pledge over the material bank accounts of the Senior
Notes Issuer will secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees thereof on a first priority basis and
will not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the New Senior Credit Facilities, such pledge may secure additional
debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in
the debt secured by the Senior Notes Collateral or a reduction of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior
Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral will be applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the
Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) the Senior
Secured Notes and any lenders under the New Senior Credit Senior Facilities, among others, before repayment
of the Senior Notes and Senior Notes Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes
exceed the value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees,
those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt
ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets
pledged as Senior Notes Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes, those
claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Senior Notes, and the Senior
Notes Indenture will allow the Senior Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt
permitted to be incurred under the Senior Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Notes
and the Senior Notes Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure
the Senior Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and
the obligations under the Senior Notes are accelerated, the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees will
not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of unsecured debt
of the Senior Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that are excluded
from the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes.

**_The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_**
**_circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Notes, holders of the Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of
the Senior Notes Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Senior Notes and, in respect of the Shared
Collateral, only after the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities
have been paid in full. In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Senior Notes, the
proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Notes
Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Notes, including due to the reasons described in the preceding
sentence. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this
Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among
other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such
sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are
located and the availability of buyers.

The Senior Notes Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes may
provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be
liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the
Senior Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation
thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on
persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our


-----

business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only
permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential
buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Senior Notes Collateral and any
transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents,
approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to
obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of
operations may occur and the value of the Senior Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our
assets will not secure the Senior Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Notes Collateral will not be
sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Senior Notes Collateral. With respect to any
shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees thereof, such
shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in
relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares
have been pledged must first be satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity.
As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in
the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Senior Notes Collateral may decline over time. If
the proceeds of the Senior Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Notes, the
holders of the Senior Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Notes Collateral)
would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
remaining assets.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders
of the Senior Notes on the Senior Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or third
parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Notes
Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior
Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior
Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Notes being offered hereby, thereby
diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Notes Collateral.

**Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes**

**_Each Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could_**
**_reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Collateral providers to remain in possession of,
retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to
the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain
conditions, the providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent,
conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of
indebtedness.

**_Not all of the Guarantors will initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors. We will agree in the
Indentures, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, to take such necessary actions so that the Post-Closing
Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee supplemental indentures
substantially in the forms attached to the Indentures within 180 days from the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under
the New Senior Credit Facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such
additional Guarantees within the time period specified. The Issue Date Guarantees by the Issue Date Guarantors
and Post-Closing Guarantees by the Post-Closing Guarantors will be limited as set forth in “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or_**
**_the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or voidance
periods for such Note Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security


-----

interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular,
as the Indentures will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance
period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective
and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity
interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees thereof or the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of France, the Senior Notes Issuer is organized
under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France;
and the Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those
jurisdictions, and certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuers and certain of
their subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency,
administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under
the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws
of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in
such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may
limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of each Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any
conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular
jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees and the
Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_In certain jurisdictions, security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by_**
**_local law._**

In France, where parallel debt obligations are, or a separate appointment of the security trustee for local law
purposes is, customary or required, the security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of each
Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will not be granted directly to
the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indentures and the
Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security Agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq of
the French Civil Code has the right to enforce such security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes
will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will provide instructions (subject to the
provisions of the respective Indentures) to the Security Agent.

The security over the Collateral in France will be granted in favor of the Security Agent as beneficiary of
parallel debt obligations (“Parallel Debt”) created to satisfy a requirement that the Security Agent, as grantee of
certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Guarantor. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security
Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the
same time as the obligations of each Issuer under the respective Indentures and the Notes, including any
additional Notes (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall
discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim
against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Senior Notes Issuer for the full principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, respectively. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to enforce such
security, except through the Security Agent. Holders of Notes bear some risks associated with a possible


-----

insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as a beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Parallel Debt
obligations referred to above are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, which is governed by English law.
There can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective before French or Luxembourg courts since
there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce
the Collateral may be restricted as the Collateral may be invalid or unenforceable with respect to the claims of
any person who is not a party to the relevant security document, including all holders of the Notes.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the parallel debt structure are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interest in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as
applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. The Security Agent will
not be under any obligation to take any steps to perfect any such liens. Any failure to perfect any security
interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the
priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and
other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent
will be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of,
any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes and the Note_** **_Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the_**
**_Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including a
sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of
the Indentures and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Indentures will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted
subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indentures, all of the
liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Note Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released
under the Indentures, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such
unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

Under various circumstances, the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released, including pursuant to the
provisions described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown” and “Description of the
_Senior Notes—IPO Pushdown.”_

**_The insolvency laws of France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Note_** **_Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date as described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, our obligations under the
relevant Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the relevant
Collateral. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of France, the Senior Notes Issuer is
organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized under the laws
of France. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest,” as defined in the Council of the
European Union Regulation No. 134612000 on Insolvency Proceedings, is the jurisdiction where the registered
office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and pledges of certain present and
future intercompany loan receivables and bank accounts held by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries and third-party Collateral providers (as applicable) incorporated
under the laws of France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.


-----

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and
regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more of each Issuer’s, the
Guarantors or any other of each Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or
the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against each Issuer, the enforceability of a Note
Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances, the
court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency.
The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview,
describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s
fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally,
as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other
grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

    - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or
the Security Interests provided by such Guarantor;

    - direct that each Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes return
any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or
to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and

    - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a
preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot
assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of
each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in
such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution
or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents (as
defined herein) will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would
apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire
Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See
also “—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations
_or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for
example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the
Guarantor:

    - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering,
delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over
others, or created such security after its insolvency;

    - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent
businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such
Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew
or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been
made; or

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note
Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were
incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the Guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis
and: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or
the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii)


-----

was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s
assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts
beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different
jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if:

    - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

    - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

    - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Although we believe we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no
assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of
the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method
of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or
the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on
other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees and
Security Interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or_**
**_defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our Guarantors are organized under the laws of France. Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee
against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to each Issuer or the relevant Guarantor,
as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and the enforcement of each such Note Guarantee will
be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each
jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate
interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Note
Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory
laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur
civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Note Guarantee without a
corresponding increase in the amount of the Note Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its
beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to
certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the
Note Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant
Guarantors. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Note Guarantee could be materially reduced or
eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in
relation to, indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its
acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable
and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from
the enforcement of any security, require that the recipient return the payment or any proceeds so obtained to the
relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the French Guarantor or security provider did not
receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or


-----

security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-bycase basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the Guarantor or security provider and whether the
amounts guaranteed or secured are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which
French case law provides no clear guidance.

In addition, each of the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder
will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security
provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or
Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note
Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note
Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other
general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to
contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any such
Note Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain
contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other
document governing the Note Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure
compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a
Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or
eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to
a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor
or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the
case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability
of the Guarantor’s guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the
applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent
that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply the Notes would be to that extent
effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade
payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to
similar limitations.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office
holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantor’s guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note
Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the Note Guarantee obligation
apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor,
including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover,
an increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the
amount of the Note Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the
holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—The Notes Guarantees,” “Description of
_the Senior Notes—The Notes Guarantees”_ and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, will not be and are not required to be, registered
under the US Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in
the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with
Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the US Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of
investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the
Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or
definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common
depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes


-----

representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global
notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests
in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After
payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuers will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures
of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the
Notes under the Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of
such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until definitive registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear
and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry;
_Delivery and Form.”_

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to: the liquidity of any market in the Notes; your ability to sell your Notes; or the
prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for
the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility
in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a
holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that
they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to
do so and may discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market
making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the US Securities Act and other applicable laws and
regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including_**
**_depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of nonGuarantor subsidiaries of the Issuers, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries
before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the
Issuers and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuers becomes
insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent
transaction:

    - the creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have
no right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

    - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other
disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or
indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such
subsidiary.


-----

As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the
Issuers. In addition, the Indentures will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries
to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indentures,
and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indentures will not contain any limitation on the amount of
other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. As of
December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes had €7.4 million of indebtedness,
excluding accrued interest, bank overdraft and deposits and guarantees received.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for US securities law violations._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors (together, the “Non-US Obligors”)
are organized or incorporated outside the United States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the
United States. The directors and executive officers of the Non-US Obligors are non-residents of, and
substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Non-US Obligors will
submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under US securities laws,
you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of
Non-US Obligors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Non-US Obligors and their
subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may
be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in US courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of
the US Supreme Court, actions of the Non-US Obligors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the
federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce: (i) judgments
of United States courts obtained against the Non-US Obligors and the directors and executive officers who are
not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and
state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons
predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with Germany and the
Netherlands. For further information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuers may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender_**
**_offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the respective Indenture) occurs, the Issuers will be required to make an
offer to purchase all the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In
such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any
such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing
to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable
terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the New Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of
such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would
constitute a default under the Indentures, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations
or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of
control as defined in the Indentures.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed
not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net leverage ratio
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such


-----

tender offer and the relevant Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer,
purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the relevant Issuer or such third
party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Optional Redemption”_ and “Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the respective Indenture, the
relevant Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of
“change of control” in the Indentures will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any person. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established
meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is
subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in
ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets
of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the relevant
Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described in “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown” and in “Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Pushdown”), pursuant to which_
the Issuers are entitled to give notice that the terms of the Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—_
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will automatically operate so that, among other things, the references to_
such Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Definitions” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions) shall apply_
only to the Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown” and in
“Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Pushdown”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding
company of the Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the applicable Indenture.

In either case, such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for US federal income tax purposes
as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after
such modifications (the “New Notes”). If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for US federal
income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes
in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for US
federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as
issued with original issue discount. In such event, US Holders (as defined under “Certain Tax Consequences—
_Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would be required to include the original issue discount in_
their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the
determination of whether the New Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the
possibility of additional payments, as further described under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain US Federal
_Income Tax Considerations—Additional Payments,” would be made at the time of the modification. US_
Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the US federal income tax considerations relating to
potential modifications of the Notes in connection with the IPO Pushdown.

It is also possible that the IPO Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other than US federal
income tax purposes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the
likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and


-----

may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be
given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so
warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or
more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and
could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

Each of the Indentures will provide that, if at any time following the date of each Indenture, the Notes issued
under such Indenture receive an investment grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB or better by
S&P, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing
until such time as such Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants
will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” and “Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any time when_
these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash
dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment
grade rating nor that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Exchange._**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the
Issuers cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or
if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuers may cease to make or maintain
such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the Notes on the Exchange does not imply
that a public offering of any of the Notes in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man has been authorized.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the
Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing of the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange or the delisting of the Notes
from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s
ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The EUR Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a US investor, an investment in the EUR
Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to the US dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have
no control. Depreciation of the euro against the US dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
EUR Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a US dollar basis.

**_The Indentures will not be qualified under the US Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indentures will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the US Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate nor include and will not be subject to any of the provisions of the
TIA. Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to
holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential collections
by the trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and
“Description of the Senior Notes.”

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the_**
**_interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our_**
**_indebtedness._**

As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39, 1-1° of the French Tax Code, expenses incurred by a French company
are deductible provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct corporate interest and (ii)
they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of
“abnormal act of management,” according to which the expenses incurred by a French company, in relation with
transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible.


-----

Under Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not
related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible only up to the
amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code (i.e.,
the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity
exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by
related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of
interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to
the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from
independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances.

Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the
entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power
of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a
same third entity.

In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Article 39-1-3 and 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code), non-deductible
interest might be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax
Code, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at
(i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219 I
of the French Tax Code (i.e., 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years
beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting legal persons or (ii) the rate of 75% for payments
made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code other than
those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in any case to more favorable provisions of
an applicable double tax treaty).

Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an
entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a prorata
_temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last 12 months) and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same_
fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into
consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses)
generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party
financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions.

Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard
clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of
their own funds over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the
accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the
30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount.

French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the
related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s own funds, the deduction of net
financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of
its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed
from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the
French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the
closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the
company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up
to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average
amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning
of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the
beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made
available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by
these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall
indebtedness ratio of the group as determined under accounting consolidation rules (i.e., the ratio existing
between the total amount of the consolidated group’s debts (with the exception of those owed to companies
belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the consolidated group’s own funds) to which it belongs
is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of its debts
and the amount of its own funds).

Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and
deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax


-----

deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only
eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal
year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in
respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities.

Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30%
Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and
(ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules
applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by
related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax
consolidated group.

These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer (in respect of any loans contracted by the
Issuer from any related party) and at the level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same
French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the
Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans
contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party.

Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May
13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible
by virtue of (i) Article 212 bis, I of the French Tax Code under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 bis,
VII of the French Tax Code under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed
distribution” pursuant to Articles 119 et seq. of the French Tax Code and, therefore, is not subject to the
withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code.

Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 includes specific provisions which implement into French tax
legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which would be
applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which would be applicable as from
January 1, 2022.

In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former
French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed.

Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions
in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of
such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or
(ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying
and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place
between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement
pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain
conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income
will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity
will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the
hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving
entity or at the level of the paying entity.

In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities,
referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is
incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding
directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to
share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid
mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French
corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to
the extent that it is not taxed in another State.

The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in
France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.


-----

**_The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal,
Slovenia and Slovakia (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted
and implemented by France, should replace the French FTT. Following the Economic and Financial Affairs
Council (the “ECOFIN”) meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the
negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on
FTT. The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a
note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019, indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States to
continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions
tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member
State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax
being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU Member
States may decide to participate and Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. Prospective holders
of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes will be €400 million and the Senior
Notes will be €250 million. We intend to use the proceeds from the Offering, together with drawings under the
New Term Loan Facility, (i) to repay amounts outstanding under our Existing Senior Facilities, (ii) as funds
earmarked for identified acquisitions anticipated to close during the first half of 2021, (iii) to make a distribution
to shareholders and (iv) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions.
Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from our
estimates of fees, expenses and commissions and the date of repayment of existing indebtedness. For
descriptions of our current and anticipated indebtedness following the offering of the Notes and the use of
proceeds therefrom, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalization.”

(2) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes offered hereby.

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes offered hereby.

(4) Represents the full repayment of €1,187 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Existing TLB and €120 million in
aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility (in each case excluding accrued and unpaid
interest and fees) as of December 31, 2020. As part of the Transactions, we expect to repay and cancel the Existing Senior Facilities
with the proceeds of the Offering and drawings under the New Term Loan Facility on the Issue Date. The actual repayment amount of
the Existing TLB and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility may differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors,
including the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and break fees, if any.

(5) Represents €110.0 million earmarked to potentially fund identified acquisitions anticipated to close during the first half of 2021. These
proceeds reflect the use of funds needed to consummate the H1 Acquisitions that have been taken into consideration in our Pro Forma
M&A Adjusted EBITDA, including synergies we expect to realize from the integration of the H1 acquisitions, presented in this
Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Summary Financial and Other
_Information—Summary Other Financial and Operating Data—Other financial data” and “Capitalization.” The actual amount of the_
purchase prices may differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors and there can be no assurance that any or all of
these acquisitions will close. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our ability to grow our business relies
_significantly upon our acquisition strategy and there can be no guarantee that sufficient or appropriate acquisition opportunities will_
_be available to us, that we will be able to close any or all acquisitions under purchase agreements, exclusivity arrangements or letters_
_of intent, or that financing will be available on acceptable terms” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—_

_in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely_
_on them.”_

(6) Represents our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including discounts and other commissions, accrued
and unpaid interest on the Existing Senior Facilities, advisory and other professional fees, and transaction costs. The actual amount of
transaction fees and expenses may differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors, including differences from our
estimates of fees and expenses and the actual fees and expenses as of the completion of the various transactions referred to in the table
above. We anticipate funding any increase in the actual transaction costs using cash from operations or, if required, drawings under
the New Revolving Credit Facility.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and capitalization of the Group as of December 31,
2020, on a historical consolidated basis and as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions (including the use of
proceeds from this Offering).

The table below should be read in conjunction with “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other

(1) Cash and cash equivalents is presented net of bank overdrafts. The as adjusted figure does not reflect the use of €110 million of
proceeds from the Transactions earmarked for the H1 Acquisitions. See “Use of Proceeds.” We anticipate that these acquisitions, if
and when completed, would be partially or fully funded with such earmarked cash. The actual amount of the acquisition costs may
differ from the estimated amount depending on several factors and there can be no assurance that any or all of these acquisitions will
close. Any increase in the actual acquisition costs will be paid using cash on hand or additional drawings under the drawings under the
New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our ability to grow our business
_relies significantly upon our acquisition strategy and there can be no guarantee that sufficient or appropriate acquisition opportunities_
_will be available to us, that we will be able to close any or all acquisitions under purchase agreements, exclusivity arrangements or_

(2) Represents drawn amounts under the Existing Senior Facilities, including €1,187 million under the Existing TLB and €120 million
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. We intend to repay in full and cancel our Existing Senior Facilities on or around the
Issue Date.

(3) The amount shown reflects the aggregate amount expected to be drawn under the New Term Loan Facility, which will be established
under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. We expect the New Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn as of the Issue Date.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes offered hereby.

(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes offered hereby, which will be guaranteed by, among other subsidiaries, the

statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019 and the consolidated income statement and cash flow statement for the year
ended December 31, 2019 were restated to give effect to application of the definitive decision of the IFRS IC and subsequent position

(b) Data for 2018 has not been restated to reflect the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16. We began applying IFRS 16 from

January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information. Under this approach,
a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted
for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. However, following additional analyses
carried out in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 15 (related to revenue from contracts with customers), in the year
ended December 31, 2019, we changed our accounting presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to
the reclassification of the contracts to be classified as contracts where we act as agent, as opposed to contracts where we act as
principal as was previously the case, and the statement of profit and loss figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been

_Management for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See “Presentation of Financial_
_Information and Other Data.”_

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Foncia_
_Management and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum as well as the_
_“Selected Historical Financial Information.” A summary of the critical accounting estimates that have been_
_applied to Foncia Management’s consolidated financial statements is set forth below in “—Critical Accounting_

_Statements.” For a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us as a result of various factors, see “Risk_
_Factors.”_

**Overview**

We are the European leader in the residential real estate services (“RRES”) market, providing services to both
individuals (“business-to-consumer” or “B2C”) and businesses (“business-to-business” or “B2B”), and have
recently entered the commercial real estate services segment for B2B customers. In addition, we have
established ourselves as a leader for real estate services in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and
Luxembourg by delivering high quality, reliable and innovative products uniquely suited to the needs of our
customers. We assist our residential and commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with
competitive and comprehensive service offerings. We provide end-to-end assistance, from managing individual
apartments and building areas jointly owned by apartment owners through our lease management and joint
property management business lines, respectively, to providing renting, brokerage and digital and ancillary
services such as insurance brokerage, technical diagnostic, and distribution and energy brokerage offerings
through our other business lines. Our RRES business is the leader in France, operating under the Foncia brand
through a network of approximately 134 and 131 branches dedicated to our RRES and Brokerage businesses,
respectively, and 242 branches dedicated to both our RRES and Brokerage businesses, representing 84% of our
revenue in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. We operate an additional 101 branches under various
brands in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our
French RRES business, Brokerage business, ancillary services, Digital services, B2B services and international
business generated 60%, 13%, 6%, 4%, 4% and 13% of our total revenue, respectively.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our performance and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors,
including external factors. Certain of these key factors that have had, or may have, an effect on our results are
set forth below. For further discussion of the factors affecting our results of operations, see “Risk Factors.”

**_Macroeconomic and market conditions_**

Our results of operations, including the demand for rental properties and our Brokerage businesses, the ability of
tenants to pay rent and the level of our costs and expenses, are impacted by economic trends and market
conditions such as:

    - changes in interest and inflation rates, unemployment rates and the level of wages;

    - economic growth or decline;

    - demographics (population size, growth and composition of a residential property);

    - consumer confidence in the economy or the residential property market;

    - local or regional economic conditions in the markets we serve;

    - local and regional property inventory levels, the cost of land and land use restrictions;

    - credit market strength and the cost and availability of mortgage financing;


-----

    - mortgage underwriting standards or down payment requirements;

    - levels of foreclosure activity in the French, German, Swiss and Belgian markets, home
ownership rates and consumer preferences;

    - political uncertainty or other geopolitical developments, pandemics or natural disasters;

    - global pandemics or natural disasters disrupting day-to-day operations and activities; and

    - man-made disasters that disrupt local or regional markets that we serve.

These factors combined with the cyclical nature of the residential property market impact supply and demand,
which in turn impact, among other things, residential property prices, Brokerage business commissions and the
volume of Brokerage transactions. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Macroeconomic and market conditions.”_
We believe the diversified nature of our services between recurring and transaction-based activities, our
geographic coverage including nationwide presence in France and certain other geographies and the scale of our
business have provided some insulation from economic cycles and resiliency to negative market conditions. We
classify our revenues as either “stock” (recurring) or “flow” (transaction-tied). Within each business line, there
may be stock and flow components based on the various types of revenue streams.

Our stock businesses consist of recurring revenues, which by their nature provide better long-term visibility and
are less sensitive to the volume of housing transactions and economic cycles. Stock revenue generation is
primarily composed of, in both residential and B2B businesses, our Joint Property Management fixed fee, Lease
Management fee, including fees on collected rents and insurance broker fees and fees unique to our business
such as our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés” or “rent payment guarantee”) which we
offered on 66% of our residential dwellings in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. For more
information on our rent payment fees, see “—Rent payment and occupancy guarantees.” Our Joint Property
Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses are examples of largely stock businesses
producing a high share of recurring revenues. Notwithstanding the stability, stock businesses retain some
sensitivity to changing economic or market conditions. For example, higher unemployment rates or potential
decreases in wages or salaries may affect the average income of tenants or reduce their ability to pay rent and, if
tenants do not make rental payments, we are unable to collect our fees which are taken by automatic deduction
from rental payments. In addition, if tenants are unable to pay their rent, this could impact the property owner’s
(i.e., our customers) ability to pay certain other fees and this non-payment could obligate us to make payments
to the property owner under our rent payment guarantees. Where we have offered our rent payment guarantee,
we bear the cost if a tenant fails to make a timely rent payment and these advances are not always recoverable.
Our business model, however, aims to balance both stock and flow businesses to mitigate the impact of
changing market conditions with a stable mix revenue derived from stock and flow businesses. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, 62% of our revenue derived from stock businesses.

Flow activities are those for which we charge transactional fees that are not automatically recurring, and are thus
more dependent on the external factors listed above. Our Brokerage business is an example of a largely flow
business where we only receive a fee upon the closure of a transaction and, therefore, it faces greater exposure
to economic fluctuations than our stock businesses. Brokerage fees are limited to our real estate sales
transactions. Other examples of flow activities include revenue generation composed of, for example, letting
fees, Constatimmo (our technical due diligence and inventories services unit) activities related to brokerage and
letting, some Joint Property Management variable fees, such as transfer fees, reminder fees and maintenance and
repair commissions on third-party invoices.

We generated 87% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 in France. Although we operate
nationwide in France and therefore benefit from diversification across a range of real estate services markets, we
are particularly sensitive to the economic conditions and developments in France as well as potential regulatory
changes, economic shocks, or social upheaval, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. See “—Compliance with laws and regulations.”

**_Acquisitions and service locations_**

We have historically expanded our operations through prudent, mostly small bolt-on acquisitions of contracts or
businesses with properties under management. The real estate services market, particularly in France, is highly
fragmented, providing opportunities to add scale, market presence and revenues by acquiring businesses,


-----

centralizing costs and operating as part of our diversified portfolio. These acquisitions have been a driver of the
growth in our geographic scale, breadth of offerings, revenue and profit margins.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed 61 acquisitions in both our primary French market and in
our other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management dwellings (bringing our total
to approximately 330,005) and approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings (bringing our
total to approximately 1,463,402) and approximately €111.0 million of acquired revenues. In addition, as part
of our overall growth strategy, we proactively manage the composition of our portfolio. We take measures to
increase efficiencies and profit and cash flows which include focusing on our RRES business offerings and
occasionally disposing of certain assets that are less profitable. For more information on our business lines, see
“Business—Overview.”

Our results of operations are affected by the number of locations where we provide services and the geographies
and market conditions in which those sites are located. As a result, our results for future periods may not be
directly comparable to past periods because of the large volume of acquisition activity that we have undertaken.
The following table reflects the number of properties we managed in our RRES lines for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

**Total Number of Properties**

**RRES Lines** **2020** **2019** **2018**

Joint Property Management - Dwellings under management

(France) .......................................................................................... 1,463,402 1,394,206 1,287,611
Lease Management - Dwellings under management (France) ........... 330,005 326,154 311,888
Lettings - Number of lettings (France) .............................................. 59,288 64,341 64,976

We continually evaluate opportunities for acquisitions to improve market positions within our existing markets
or potentially to enter into new markets. We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is
dedicated to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our four
geographical regions. We are likely to continue to undertake expansion projects in the future to support
geographic growth and profitability and improve the breadth and quality of our service offerings. The number
of acquisitions we undertake depends on the quality and pricing of potential targets available for purchase at a
given time. Additionally, a key point of focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary
reason we decline to pursue a target after entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of their customer
accounting. By law, we are required to have separate accounts for our Joint Property Management customers
and if a target has poor customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances,
complying with applicable law or integrating such target’s systems into our own. The price paid for a particular
acquisition depends in part on the target entity’s revenues and cost base, along with competition to acquire the
business. Our results of operations are therefore impacted by the quality of our due diligence, as well as by our
success in integrating any acquired businesses into ours and extracting synergies, gains and cost savings from
such acquisitions.

Following an acquisition, we integrate the companies into our existing group structure and consolidate all
administrative functions, such as payroll, human resources, IT, procurement, sales and marketing, finance and
treasury and other support functions, with our central headquarters. Acquisitions we complete may also lead to
improved margins and customer retention through, among other measures, the offering of ancillary services to
an expanding customer base in a wider geographic network and the leveraging of our scale to procure additional
premium partnerships and favorable pricing terms in our utility contracts for our customers. These initiatives
have contributed to the successful integration of the acquisitions that we have made and the realization of
synergies from such acquisitions. As a result of integrating the acquired business into our existing business, we
may also experience an increase in one-off costs such as IT and other integration costs, accounting costs,
severance costs, real estate lease agreements termination penalties, potential retention bonuses for key
employees, cost related to the rebranding or other expenditures. Therefore our results for the period during
which an acquisition takes place may be affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our
consolidated results from the date of their combination or acquisition. We have a track record of implementing
a majority of synergies immediately following the acquisition and are able to quickly realize the impact of the
synergies, gains and costs savings from the acquisition. However, it may take up to 18 months to realize our
expected costs and efficiency gains for an acquired business. See “Summary Historical Financial Information
_and Other Data—Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary Other Financial and Operating Data.”_

**_Rent payment and occupancy guarantees_**

We offer rent payment guarantees (“Garantie de loyers impayés” or “rent payment guarantee”) on individual
dwellings to certain residential landlords in France for whom we provide property management services. We
bear the cost of any unpaid rent and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable
from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. However, due to our diligent selection and
recovery processes as described below, we believe these rental guarantees offer an attractive business model and
by underwriting these guarantees on our balance sheet, we believe we offer a differentiating and competitive
service to customers that smaller players would not be able to deliver.

Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts and, while a tenant remains in the
property, we account for the related payments as follows:

    - the rent guarantee related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the
mandate, since they are deducted from rents in the same way as basic property management
fees; and

    - when a tenant fails to make their rent payment and after they have vacated the property, we
record a provision on our balance sheet that is calculated in accordance with IAS 37 to
account for the loss.

The amount of the provision we set aside increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for
rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees,
regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (“Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires” or “ACL”) have
been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly
updated). From a cash flow perspective, we pay rent to the landlord when rent is due, regardless of whether rent
is received from the tenant, and will take remedial measures to try to recover the payment from the tenant. Once
a tenant leaves the property, we record for the direct loss.

We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation” or “occupancy guarantee”) to a small number
of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected
apartments in new buildings. We typically only offer this occupancy guarantee in limited circumstances for
highly desirable properties where we believe there is a low risk of loss. The provision for occupancy guarantees
is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently
vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly
rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days.

In December 2020, on average, 66% of our residential dwellings in France were covered by the rent payment
guarantee and 12% of residential dwellings were covered by the occupancy guarantee. We believe we have a
strong ability to assess credit risk when offering these guarantees and we undertake a detailed process to select
eligible tenants and dwellings. We refer to the new, unpaid rents as a result of defaults under a guarantee each
month as our new monthly aggregate of unpaid rent and the total sum of unpaid rents per month as our
cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent. In December 2020, €124.7 million of rent revenues were covered by the
rent payment guarantee, for which we experienced €3.5 million new unpaid rent (compared to a 2020 monthly
average of new unpaid rent of €3.3 million) and the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent was €27.7 million,
including outstanding rent payments from previous years.


-----

The chart below sets out unpaid rents (in EUR millions) for tenants who remained in their flat versus tenants
who moved out of their flat from September 2019 to December 2020, under our rent payment guarantee:

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent increased temporarily as it
built up when we were unable to process disputes and evictions as a result of the initial lockdown restrictions in
France, but we did not experience a significant increase in the overall amounts of new unpaid rent or defaults.
The cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent also typically increases during the winter, from the first of November
to the end of March, when we are prohibited from evicting people under French law. See “Regulation—
_France—Eviction Laws and the Winter Truce—Winter Truce.” The below chart reflects this increase of the_
cumulative aggregate amount of unpaid rents (in EUR millions) for tenants who remained in their flat, under our
rent payment guarantee, that temporarily increased during the COVID-19 pandemic:

We take proactive measures to insulate our business from losses under both the rent payment guarantee and
occupancy guarantee including through the stringent credit assessment that we undertake before providing these
guarantees and our unpaid rental collection processes. Following an eviction and the transfer of the surrogative
discharge from the landlord to us, we have a strong team that seeks to recover the unpaid rent from the
defaulting tenant, including by legal means. We have historically recovered approximately 35% of the unpaid
rent amount over the last three years, which is added to our statement of profit and loss as revenue. Therefore,
given the regulatory regime that restricts when we can evict a tenant and the time it takes to collect unpaid rent,
the risk associated with the guarantees has historically been related to the timing of cash flows, rather than lost
revenue. However, any unrecoverable payments under these guarantees could result in a significant loss or have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant_
_defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have_
_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_

**_COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business_**

The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause significant volatility, uncertainty and
economic disruption. In order to comply with government-imposed social distancing recommendations, all of
our premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public during the initial lockdown (from mid-March
to mid-May 2020 in France), as well as to employees, barring exceptional cases. We were most acutely
impacted during this initial lockdown. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced direct impacts in
the year ended December 31, 2020 on revenue, margins and operating cash flow, particularly related to the
Brokerage business and, to a lesser extent, to the Joint Property Management and Lease Management and
Renting businesses, and our other businesses as described below. Moreover, we typically recognize revenue in
our Brokerage business up to three months following the closing of a transaction. Therefore, although our
Brokerage business experienced an estimated impact from the second lockdown in the year ended December 31,
2020, the full impact is not expected to be reflected in our financial statements until 2021.

_Consequences of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_

The general lockdown measures imposed by the governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate
effectively froze the property market from the middle of March to May 2020. In order to protect our workforce
and maintain the continuity of our operations, we implemented preventative measures including allowing
employees to work from home, permitting short-term working arrangements and providing exceptional travel
certificates to certain employees to carry out minimum duties. See “—Business continuity plan.” These costs
were all accounted as non-recurring operating income (expenses) due to their exceptional nature. Partially due
to the success of the measures we have implemented, we believe we have been able to manage our operations
and employee absenteeism, with minimal disruption. As the countries in which we operate progress through
varying levels of restrictions and until activity resumes to normalized levels, we will continue to be impacted.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic and
the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain,
rapidly changing and difficult to predict.

The following table sets forth an estimated breakdown of the full COVID-19 impact on our revenue and
EBITDA for each of our businesses for the year ended December 31, 2020:

**For the year ended**
**December 31, 2020**
**Revenue** **EBITDA**

**(in millions of euros)**
Joint-Property Management ........................................................................................ (12.4) (9.1)
Brokerage .................................................................................................................... (11.1) (6.7)
Renting ........................................................................................................................ (7.6) (3.6)
Lease Management ...................................................................................................... (7.2) (5.2)
Holiday Rental & Foncia ImmoNeuf .......................................................................... (1.0) (0.2)

HQ Cost ...................................................................................................................... – 0.7

**Total ...........................................................................................................................** **(51.1)** **(31.2)**

For purposes of determining our Adjusted EBITDA, we have only included €20.8 million that represents the
estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our stock (recurring) business lines as those are generally more
stable and predictable. Similarly, for the purposes of determining our Pro Forma Revenues, we have included
€32.4 million that represents the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our stock (recurring) business
lines. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Summary Financial and Other
_Information—Summary Other Financial and Operating Data—Other financial data.” For purposes of_
determining our Adjusted EBITDA, we have excluded the €10.3 million estimated impact on our Brokerage and
Letting business lines, which are primarily non-recurring flow businesses. Similarly, for the purposes of
determining our Pro Forma Revenues, we have excluded the €18.7 million estimated impact on our Brokerage
and Letting business lines. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present
_information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro_
_Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering_
_Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain_
_estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has_


-----

_caused severe disruptions in the global economy and financial markets which could adversely affect our_
_business.”_

The renting side of our Lease Management and Renting business is a transaction-based business in which our
fee is recognized upon the entry of the new tenant in the dwelling. The French government largely prohibited
people from moving to new properties during the initial lockdown which impacted our ability to generate
revenue during that period.

Our Lease Management business continued to mostly function normally from an administrative perspective, but
disruptions to the postal service did lead to delays in delivering customer invoices and receiving customer
checks by mail. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is also a risk, particularly in our commercial
Lease Management business, that fees on unpaid rent will be difficult to collect on the scheduled timetable or at
all. Commercial customers from our Lease Management business represent 5% of our Lease Management
dwellings. Certain of our customers negotiated for, and we agreed to, a rent holiday or reduced rental payments
for a fixed period after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite some lost revenue, we believe these
negotiations were more advantageous than initiating eviction proceedings and finding a new tenant in this
market in the event a customer missed a rental payment. The collection of fees and rent from our residential
Lease Management customers was also partially impacted in certain regions such as Marseille as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Brokerage business was virtually at a standstill during the initial lockdown beginning in March 2020 since
we do not recognize revenue until after finalizing a transaction and physical visits of properties were not
possible during this period. In addition, during this lockdown, real estate agents were not able to travel to sign
mandates or make visits, and notaries were closed through May 2020. The cessation of notary services and
prohibition on visits in particular resulted in limited production and revenue recognition during this lockdown.
During the government lockdowns that followed, notaries were permitted to work and although in-person
property viewings for customers remained limited or prohibited, real estate professionals were allowed to show
properties via video chat. Therefore, while we were able to close transactions in the second lockdown which
took place from October 30 to November 28, 2020, the ongoing lockdown restrictions had some impact on our
revenue. Since the French government has determined that notaries can work through lockdown measures, it is
unlikely we will experience a period of zero production in the future. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is
rapidly changing as well as actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, and
thus we cannot predict the impact it may have on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

Our Joint Property Management business was relatively resilient with minor impact to revenue as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic because our employees continued operations from a remote working environment in
which they were able to successfully service customers. In addition, Joint Property Management business
experienced a fall in revenue from incidental fees such as transfer fees since people were not moving as
frequently, and fees for additional services. Joint property owners pay these additional fees as commission for a
specific service they request for additional works. These fees are typically approved at the general assembly
meetings of joint property owners, which were often delayed when in-person meetings were banned as a result
of lockdown measures. However, these general assembly meetings are now primarily held online and the
incurrence of these incidental fees has resumed.

Our other businesses were impacted to varying degrees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition,
Lodgis, our platform for letting furnished apartments, which largely targets temporary residents such as
international students and professionals, experienced a large drop in revenue as a result of a significant decrease
in the number of expatriate students and professionals moving to the countries in which we operate. For more
information on Lodgis, see “Business—Overview.”

Revenue for Constatimmo, which prepares diagnostic and inventory reviews before a tenant enters an
apartment, is largely linked to the brokerage and renting market cycles so it experienced a similar decrease in
revenue as a result of fewer lettings that require such review. For more information on Constatimmo, see
“Business—Overview.”

Through our Assurimo business, we offer specialized property insurance to joint property owners. The general
assemblies of the joint property owners in France are typically key events at which we engage with these
customers and market and contract for these insurance products. When lockdown restrictions largely prohibited
in-person meetings and many of these events were postponed from March to May 2020, we experienced an
initial drop in revenue in this business line, but it rebounded later in the year. Esset, our B2B business which
comprises all lines of business with commercial and institutional customers, did not experience a significant


-----

impact. However, revenue did decrease initially when we were not able to carry out renovation work in France
due to lockdown restrictions in March 2020.

Revenue for our Swiss and Belgian businesses experienced similar trends as those in France. Germany was less
impacted than the other jurisdictions in which we operate, but also broadly followed analogous trends.

Our resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic has been in part due to the initiatives implemented by our
leadership team which included utilizing government assistance programs in France and Switzerland to
supplement salaries for furloughed employees who were unable to work and implementing cost-saving measures
such as reducing the number of contracts dedicated to individual properties and hiring temporary employees.
Our business Efficity also received a cash loan with a state guarantee in the amount of €1.4 million for a period
of one year. This loan was repaid in December 2020. In addition, unplanned cost-savings benefits were
achieved as employee travel costs were eliminated due to travel restrictions imposed by the governments across
all countries in which we operate and bonuses, which are linked to employee performance, were lower than
budgeted.

_information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly_
_rely on them.”_

_Business continuity plan_

We implemented different procedures in order to address this unprecedented situation which were designed to
protect the health of our employees but also to ensure that a minimum and critical level of business can
continue. These procedures included:

    - Work from home for all employees whose work can be performed from home and who had
the necessary tools available.

    - In RRES and our Brokerage businesses, an exceptional travel certificate was granted to
managers so that they could carry out minimum duties alongside senior executives. An
exceptional, occasional travel certificate subject to restrictions was issued to critical
employees dealing, for example, with incoming correspondence, cash inflows and payments
and handovers.

    - For employees facing increasingly difficult working conditions such as lettings negotiators,
developers or real estate consultants, short-time working arrangements were put in place.

We designed organizational and communication guidelines for businesses in order to optimize our organization
during these exceptional circumstances using various procedures. We believe we were able to quickly adapt to
the changing circumstances presented by teleworking and the COVID-19 pandemic without significant
additional costs as a result of investments in IT and digitalization that we had undertaken in the past. As a
precautionary measure, on March 19 and 24, 2020 we drew an aggregate amount of €190 million under our
Existing Revolving Credit Facility to ensure liquidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but have
subsequently repaid such amounts. For more information regarding the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on
our business for the one month ended January 31, 2021, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Current
_Trading.”_


-----

**_Compliance with laws and regulations_**

As a provider of residential and commercial real estate services, we are subject to a wide range of laws and
regulations in each of the countries in which we operate, as well as the regulations of the European Union. We
are subject to laws and regulations including those related to rental access and urban planning, rents we can
charge, data protection, tax reduction schemes for rental property investors and reforms to housing, planning
and digital technology. For example, the French government has introduced measures to protect individuals
buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. The Access to Housing
and Urban Renovation Law (“ALUR”), which was introduced in March 2014, imposed restrictions on the fees
agents can charge for selling or letting property and required two dedicated bank accounts for each jointly
owned property, thereby resulting in loss of interest income on customer accounts and a large administrative
burden. The ALUR law also required a significant amount of extra documentation before the pre-contract
(compromis de vente) can be signed, which increased the time between the initial offer and closing and thereby
delaying our revenue recognition. In addition, it required publication of commissions when payable by the
buyer and any resulting competition from low cost agents. Notwithstanding these requirements, we have
experienced certain positive impacts from the imposition of the ALUR law. For example, it required landlords
to register their buildings, which became a new fee-based service we began providing. Changes in, and
compliance with, such laws and regulations may entail significant costs for us and can have an impact on our
results of operations. For a description of certain material regulations applicable to our business, see
“Regulation.”

Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, whether identified as a result of an investigation or
otherwise, could lead to adverse publicity, harm our reputation or divert management time and other resources.
In addition, non-compliance could result in disciplinary action, imposition of fines, the revocation of a license or
authorization or the need to take remedial action. In particular, the loss of a license or authorization could mean
that we are no longer able to carry out the business or activity for which we were previously authorized or
licensed and any remedial action that may need to be undertaken could result in a significant cost. Finally, such
laws, rules and regulations may subject us to more onerous conduct of business and administrative requirements,
limit the types of fees or services we can charge and provide or otherwise alter the current regulatory or tax
environment, each of which can have a significant impact on the manner in which we conduct our businesses.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our businesses, financial condition, results
_of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing_
_laws or regulations or the application thereof. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us,_
_or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.”_

**_Cost base and operational improvements_**

Our ability to actively manage our cost base by cost saving initiatives and enhancing operational efficiencies has
been a significant factor affecting our results of operations and financial condition in the period under review.
Our principal costs include staff costs and marketing and IT costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, staff
costs accounted for 55.9% of revenue. Our business (excluding brokerage activities) has a largely fixed cost
base. Our fixed costs, which do not fluctuate with business volumes, consist primarily of salaries and wages
(excluding variable commissions, employee profit shares and bonus arrangements), rental costs, most of our
information technology (“IT”) costs, as well as other general costs. Our Brokerage business, which is more
exposed to real estate services market cycles in which our employees are paid based on commission, operates
primarily with variable costs, with approximately 26% of fixed costs for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Since variable costs tend to fluctuate with business volumes, we will need to react quickly in the future by
decreasing such costs if we forecast a potential downturn in business volumes or increase in such costs as the
market recovers. The management of our cost base is an important factor impacting our results of operations
and cash flow. We are able to initiate cost cutting measures when required, such as using temporary employees
and limiting travel, entertainment and office expenses and reducing variable compensation.

In addition, our management team sponsors a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce fixed costs.
For example, we launched a pilot version of Millenium, our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in
March 2020 at one of our branches in France, and we expect for it to be completed at the end of 2021 or early
2022. We have invested significant resources in Millenium including a team of 80 developers and specialized
professionals in order to build this innovative and advanced real estate platform. Our financial condition and
results of operations are impacted by our ability to successfully implement Millenium and other initiatives to
improve our operational performance. We believe that the improved standardization and digitization Millenium
offers, will allow us to reduce administrative inefficiencies and achieve greater productivity. In parallel to the
deployment of Millenium, we have been designing a new organizational model called Agency of the Future


-----

which will be implemented following the roll-out of Millenium. Our vision for Agency of the Future sets out
four key goals (i) industrialize tasks with low added value; (ii) distinguish ourselves thanks to our expertise in
joint property management and rental management; (iii) have close proximity to our clients; (iv) reinforce our
attractiveness for staff. As a result of this new organization model, we expect to generate significant cost and
efficiency gains mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and
back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time
spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain
tasks previously done manually (such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges). We believe
Millenium and Agency of the Future will enable us to achieve greater organization among our businesses
allowing our employees to focus on customer satisfaction with the potential to lead to improved customer
retention. In the coming years, we plan to fully digitize all business of our businesses, internal processes and
our customer relationship management with Millenium. For the year ended December 31, 2020, capital
expenditures in connection with Millenium and Agency of the Future were €17 million. We anticipate capital
expenditures of €19 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 for the development and the deployment of
Millenium. By the end of 2022, we estimate approximately €15 million in saving and gains as a result of
efficiencies due to Millenium and Agency of the Future, with approximately €20 million non-recurring costs
related to those gains. We believe that, we will experience additional gains in the following years, as a result of
these projects. For more information, see “Business—Digital Transformation and IT Systems.”

**Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting policies_**

_IFRS-16_

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017, which has had a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and
high value equipment – requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognizing a ‘right-of-use’ asset
representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make
lease payments. In the income statement, this standard application results in an amortization and interest
expenses recognition. These changes become effective from January 1, 2019.

IFRS 16 has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and high-value equipment,
requiring that leases be placed on balance sheet by recognizing a “right-of-use” asset, representing the lessee’s
right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability, representing the lessee’s obligation to make lease
payments. In the income statement, the application of this standard results in amortization and recognition of
interest expense. The changes resulting from IFRS 16 became effective as from January 1, 2019.

In accordance with IAS 8, we applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach in the consolidated
financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, with no
restatement of comparative information for 2018. As a result, the financial information presented in this
offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 does not give effect to the application of
IFRS 16.

In 2020, in light of the changes in lease accounting under IFRS 16, we initiated a strategic project aimed at reexamining (and if necessary re-estimating) the terms of lease arrangements.

As a result of this change, the duration taken into account for the valuation of leases in France that were to be
tacitly renewed was revised to be increased to three years, which can be explained by the imperatives in terms of
continuity of the operations, which encourage the continuation of the initial lease, and our strategy based on
external growth.

_2019 Restatement_

In the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the year ended December 31,
2020, the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019 and the consolidated income
statement and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 were restated to give effect to
application of the definitive decision of the IFRS IC and subsequent position statement of the ANC on
determining the lease terms of certain real estate leases.

This decision of the IFRS IC included interpretation guidelines for the determination of a lease term, in
particular with regard to French commercial leases.


-----

It includes a reminder that the lease term that when evaluating the debt associated with the lease is the period for
which it is enforceable, a lease no longer being enforceable when the lessee and the lessor each has the right to
terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty.

It also provides a clarification that in order to determine how long a lease is enforceable and whether a penalty is
insignificant under IFRS 16.B34, it is necessary to take into consideration the broader economics of the contract
and not just contractual termination payments. The notion of a penalty thus must include any economic
incentive to not terminate the contract.

In its decision, the IFRS IC also noted the need for consistency between the lease term for a lease for the
determination of the debt associated with the lease and the useful life of related non-removable leasehold
improvements.

Moreover, the French accounting standards setter (the Autorité des Normes Comptables or the “ANC”)
published on July 3, 2020 a new position statement related to the determination of the lease terms of commercial
leases known as “3-6-9 leases” (known as such because such leases are signed for at least nine years, with
unilateral termination possible by the tenant after three or six years). This new position statement replaced a
prior position statement dated February 16, 2018. In particular, in this update, the ANC concluded that the lease
term should reflect the term for which the tenant is reasonably certain to continue the lease and that, when the
legal length of the lease is nine years, this length is “generally nine years at the outset.”

In 2020, we initiated a strategic project to re-examine (and, if necessary, re-estimate) the lease terms of our real
property leases in light of the decision of the IFRS IC and the updated position statement of the ANC. As a
result of the completion of this project, the lease term that was taken into account for the evaluation of real
property leases in France that were to be tacitly renewed was revised upward to three years, based on
imperatives in terms of continuity of operations, which encourage the continuation of the initial lease, and our
particularly active and opportunistic real property strategy for the rationalization of our real property (including
in particular as a result of several restructurings due to our external growth). We had previously applied nine
months as a lease term in our 2019 financial statements when first applying IFRS 16 at January 1, 2019 (based
on the soonest possible surrender date, taking into account a legally required six-month notice period after the
end of the first quarter in the calendar year) and six months at December 31, 2019. In accordance with IAS 8,
the impacts related to these changes in lease terms and that directly result of the application of the IFRS IC
decision have been accounted for using the retrospective method. See note 3.2 to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

We refer to the restatements described above as the “2019 Restatement.” For ease of comparative review, we
present financial data reflecting the 2019 Restatement when comparing information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 with information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_2018 Restatement_

In 2019, following additional analyses carried out in connection with the application of IFRS 15, initially
adopted in 2018, we changed our income statement presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of
sale. This led to a separate classification of revenue from contracts where we act as agent, as opposed to in
aggregate with revenue from contracts where we act as principal as was previously the case. Furthermore,
revenue from contracts where we act as agent is now presented net of the cost of fees in accordance with IFRS
15.

Since this does not allow a meaningful comparison of consolidated revenue (and the related external charges)
between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the statement of profit and loss figures for the year
ended December 31, 2018 has been restated accordingly, leading to a negative impact of €14.9 million on
revenue as presented and a similar positive impact on “Purchases consumed and external charges.” This change
in presentation has no impact on recurring operating profit for 2018. In addition, net profit (loss) from
continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests was adjusted to correct a minor presentation error.
See note 2.7 to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

We refer to the restatements described above as the “2018 Restatement.” For ease of comparative review, we
present financial data reflecting the 2018 Restatement when comparing information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 with information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The timing of acquisitions and disposals may impact the comparability of our results on a year-over-year basis.
Our results include incremental revenues and expenses following the completion date of an acquisition. In
addition, there is generally an initial adverse impact on net income from an acquisition as a result of preacquisition due diligence expenditures, transaction/deal costs and post-acquisition integration costs, such as fees
from third-party advisors engaged to assist with onboarding and process alignment, retention and severance
expense, early lease termination costs, and other integration expenses. We have historically used strategic and
bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale within existing capabilities and to expand our presence in new or
existing geographic regions globally. We believe that strategic acquisitions will increase revenue, provide cost
synergies and generate incremental income in the long term.

_Recent Developments_

On December 31, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Loft-One, one of the largest property administration
companies in the Southwest of France. We paid a temporary purchase price of €27.7 million, and we acquired
14,062 properties in rental management and 38,734 in condominium management. We believe that through this
acquisition, we are emerging as the leader in the local market.

On December 11, 2020, we completed our acquisition of OP Property Management (Office des Propriétaires), a
management property company based in Brussels. We paid a total purchase price of €14.5 million, and we
acquired four branches. We believe that this acquisition will further our goal of becoming a leader for real
estate services in Belgium.

Due to timing of these two acquisitions, we have not consolidated the results into our consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, our payment for this acquisition is reflected in our
cash flow statement and their acquisition value appears as non-consolidated securities.

**Key Performance Indicators**

We use certain key performance indicators, such as the number of dwellings under management, average
revenue per dwelling, average tenant invoice per dwelling, number of lettings, letting fees per letting and
number of sales, which in our view provide alternative measures with which to monitor our economic, financial
and operating performance. For additional details on our key performance indicators, see “Summary Historical
_Financial Information and Other Data—Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary Other Financial_
_and Operating Data.” These measures are not indicative of historical operating results, nor are they meant to be_
predictive of future results. These measures are used to monitor our underlying performance and operations.
Not all companies calculate these measures in an identical manner and therefore our presentation may not be
consistent with similar measures used by other companies. See “Presentation of Financial Information and
_Other Data.”_

**Key Income Statement Line Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue results from sales of services within the scope of the ordinary operations of consolidated subsidiaries,
less revenue from intragroup transactions. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. In accordance with IFRS 15, we
recognize revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic
benefits will flow to us, and specific criteria are met by each of our businesses, as further described below.

_Joint Property Management business_

From a contractual and legal perspective, our Joint Property Management business is mostly conducted through
mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management
services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services. All such services
are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are
associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association.
Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognized on a percentage-of-completion
basis (over time) based on actual amounts billed (costs are in line with the billed amounts).


-----

Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for
each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned
property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and
disputes. Transfer Fees are also invoiced directly to a landlord selling its property. Since each additional
service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognized when the service is performed.

_Lease Management and Renting business_

In the lease management line of our Lease Management and Renting business, we act as agent for ownerslessors and fulfil a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These represent separate
service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognized separately. Revenue from
services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance is recognized on a percentageof-completion basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue
from one-off services is recognized when those services are provided.

In our lettings business, revenue is recognized at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted. We
collect fees from owners and from lessees.

_Brokerage business /Efficity_

Revenue in the transactions business is recognized upon signature of the notarized final sale agreement (acte
_authentique), which is the date on which control is presumed to have been transferred._

_Client accounts_

Interest income generated on client funds, limited to rental cash deposits, is booked in revenue.

_Assurimo_

Assurimo provides property insurance brokerage services. Revenue under comprehensive property insurance
and comprehensive homeowners’ insurance policies is recognized over the term of the cover, since services in
this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis.

_Constatimmo_

Constatimmo carries out mandatory technical surveys on premises, as well as inventories of premises for
lessees. Its revenue is recognized and measured when the related services are performed.

_Seiitra_

Seiitra provides specialist IT property services and developed the Powimo software, which it markets through its
software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions model. These property management tools offer the full suite of
functionalities needed to keep accounting records for client accounts and to manage suspense accounts, jointly
owned properties and rentals, as well as the budget of jointly owned property associations. Maintenance fees
are recognized on a straight-line, percentage-of-completion basis, since the corresponding services are provided
over time.

_Esset Management_

Esset Management provides property management services (jointly owned property management and rental
services) for B2B customers such as national and international insurance, real estate and financial institutions.
Once contracts are signed and invoices are issued, revenue recognition follows IFRS 15.

_Foncia Valorisation_

Foncia Valorisation provides investment strategy consulting and arbitrage (appraisals, lending, block/unit
property sales) for institutional customers or wealthy families. Its revenue is recognized at the date the
notarized final sale agreement is signed and is based on a percentage of the sale price.


-----

_Leemo_

Leemo, a wholly owned subsidiary since 2017, is a listing service for properties for sale. It has developed a
digital platform for property companies where it lists new real estate projects by different developers as well as
certain older properties that are to be made available for sale to private and institutional investors.

It derives its revenue from two main sources:

    - fees on sale agreements: amounts billed to developers and partially retroceded to business
providers. Only the net margin is recognized in revenue; and

    - fees on bundles of services sold to developers without any retrocession requirements.

Revenue from fees on sale agreements is recognized when the notarized final sale agreement is signed.
Revenue from fees earned on bundles of services is recognized on a pro rata basis in the period.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income primarily comprises gains on client accounts, retrocessions of fees for the Assurance
Privilège product in Assurimo’s comprehensive homeowner’s insurance portfolio, and miscellaneous net
sub-letting income.

**_Purchases consumed and external charges_**

Purchases consumed and external charges comprises fees and services, cost of premises (in the year ended
December 31, 2018 only), travel, subcontracting, insurance and guarantees, advertising, IT purchases and other
costs, postage and telephone costs, supplies and documentation and other rental costs. This also comprised
charges related to external personnel (e.g., interim staff or staff on secondment).

**_Taxes other than on income_**

Taxes other than on income includes corporate property tax, tax on vehicles, corporate social solidarity
contribution and miscellaneous other taxes other than income tax. We also included certain taxes on
compensation in taxes other than on income (including transport tax, training levy, apprenticeship tax, tax on
wages, payroll taxes and contributions to AGEFIPH (the French association for the employment of disabled
people)).

**_Personnel costs_**

Personnel costs include wages and salaries, payroll taxes, other personnel costs, employee profit-sharing and
movements in post-employment benefits.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses include directors’ fees, losses on non-recoverable receivables, royalties and other
expenses.

**_Net additions to depreciation, amortization, impairment and provisions_**

Net additions to depreciation, amortization, impairment and provisions include amortization of intangible assets;
depreciation of property, plant and equipment; impairment of receivables; reversals of receivables impairment;
impairment of inventories net of reversals; and various additions and reversals to provisions we have taken.

**_Recurring operating profit (loss)_**

Recurring operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to our businesses, with the
exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses).” Recurring operating profit
(loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes
all items included in operating profit (loss), restated for any non-recurring items. Costs relating to business
combinations or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit (loss).


-----

**_Non-recurring operating income (expenses)_**

Non-recurring operating income (expenses) includes income and expense items that, owing to their nature,
amount or frequency, cannot be considered as arising in the ordinary course of our operations and are therefore
not reported in recurring operating profit (loss). Non-recurring items are limited, unusual and/or irregular items
of a material amount and we classify these items into three main categories: (i) M&A non-recurring integrations
charges, (ii) restructuring/transformation non-recurring charges and (iii) corporate non-recurring charges.

These items include impacts of changes in the scope of consolidation, goodwill impairment, and amortization
and impairment charged against trademarks and Syndic+ software. If material, non-recurring items also include
the effects of certain unusual transactions such as capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets,
restructuring fees, fees relating to major claims and disputes, and any other income or expenses likely to affect
the comparability of recurring operating profit (loss) from one period to the next.

For transactions directly related to external growth and projects to transform or restructure the business
(particularly mergers and reorganizations), a detailed procedure is in place to identify, classify and validate any
transactions of a non-recurring nature. This procedure gives a precise indication of transactions that meet the
criteria to be recorded in this category.

**_Operating profit (loss)_**

Operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to our businesses, irrespective of
whether they are of a recurring nature or whether they result from one-off decisions or transactions.

**_Cost of gross debt_**

The cost of gross debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings.

**_Cost of net debt_**

The cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings, less financial income from cash
investments.

**_Other financial income and expenses_**

Other financial income and expenses includes foreign exchange gains (losses), net interest cost on pension and
other employee benefit obligations, capital gains (losses) on financial disposals less costs to sell, net impairment
of financial assets, gains (losses) on available-for-sale financial assets, net discounting costs and other
miscellaneous costs.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense for the year includes current and deferred income tax expense, which are recognized in the
statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items recognized in other comprehensive income.

We calculate our current taxes in accordance with the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which our
earnings are taxable. Current tax expense is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted
at the reporting date in countries where our subsidiaries operate and generate taxable profit. However,
management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are
subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax
authorities.

Income tax expense includes the amounts reported by French subsidiaries in respect of the CVAE tax assessed
on value added, since we consider this tax meets the definition of income tax set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes.
When they have not been set against income tax, income tax credits that are not included in the calculation of
taxable profit and that are always refunded by the government are recorded as subsidies and reduce the expenses
to which they relate.

**_Share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies_**

Associates are entities over which we exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling


-----

those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the
arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in our
consolidated financial statements. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is
initially recognized at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for our interest in the profits, losses and other
comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture.

As of the year ended December 31, 2019, Pagardim was the only joint venture that we did not control and that
we accounted for by the equity method, based on our 50% interest. This entity is immaterial. No material
commitments were entered into with Pagardim and there are no material liabilities relating to this entity.

(a) Our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been retrospectively restated for IFRS 16 Interpretations
Committee implementation. See “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain changes in
_accounting standards and accounting policies.”_

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €18.0 million, or 2%, from €943.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a €66.5 million
increase due to acquisitions, a €13.6 million increase in digital revenues driven by Efficity, an increase in RRES
revenues driven by a price effect of €2.3 million in Joint Property Management and €1.7 million in Lease
Management but offset by a negative €4.3 million churn in Joint Property Management and Lease Management
and a negative €4.8 million volume effect in Letting, an increase of €2.6 million due to the positive impact of
FX EUR/CHF exchange rate, higher organic brokerage revenues due to revenue recognition, partially offset by a
decrease of €51.1 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic and €18.4 million of activities disposal. For a
breakdown of this revenue loss of €51.1 million by business line, see “—Key Factors Affecting Results of
_Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business—Consequences of the impact of the COVID-19_
_pandemic.”_

ended December 31, 2019, to €579.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was
primarily driven by acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Joint Property
Management business.

Revenue for the Brokerage business (French network) decreased by €4.3 million, or 3.4%, from €129.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease
was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

December 31, 2019, to €42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to
the performance of Efficity.

Revenue for the other activities segment in France decreased by €11.1 million, or 11.2%, from €99.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019, to €87.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was
primarily driven by the cessation of operations of our investor platform and Foncia Pierre Gestion and partially
offset by an increase in the B2B business driven by the acquisition of Yxime.

Revenue for our International business increased by €17.4 million, or 16.0%, from €108.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, to €126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was
primarily driven by acquisitions in Germany, partially offset by impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, notably
in Switzerland and Belgium.

ended December 31, 2019, to €181.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was
primarily due to cost savings related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher postage and
telephone costs.

2019, to €521.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due the increase of
average full time employees, from 9,691 in 2019 to 10,575 in 2020, with an offset due to the COVID-19
pandemic which included reduced personnel expenses resulting from partial unemployment, lower commissions

31, 2019, to €4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2020 have, as a percentage of revenue, decreased slightly at 0.5% of revenue, as compared to
0.6% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to losses on client
accounts.

The increase in net additions to depreciation, amortization, impairment and provisions from the year ended
December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020 was mainly attributable to increased depreciation of
right-of-use assets of €47.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to €40.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019, related primarily to increased leases through our external growth.

_Non-recurring operating income (expenses)_

Non-recurring operating income (expenses) decreased by €1.9 million, or 2.6%, from a net expense of
€74.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to a net expenses of €72.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Non-recurring operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 have, as a

Net non-recurring operating expenses in 2020 primarily comprised of €24.2 million in integration costs. These
costs consist of: (i) €15.3 million in connection with human resource costs primarily related to rehires and costs
involving agreements, bonuses, negotiated termination benefits and payroll taxes; and (ii) other miscellaneous
expenses totaling €8.9 million related to unlocking synergies such as costs for redundant leases, moving,
contract terminations and IT. Other net non-recurring operating expenses involved (i) acquisition fees, primarily
related to fees payed to sellers or business providers for support services, market research fees and accounting,
legal and consulting assistance fees; (ii) restructuring costs in France, and (iii) earn-out expenses related to the
acquisition of Efficity.

_Cost of gross debt_

Cost of gross debt increased by €10.4 million, or 9.8%, from €106.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, to €116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase in cost of gross debt from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020
was mainly attributable to increased interest payable on Senior Facility B of €5.7 million as a result of additional
drawings in 2019, an increase in interest on shareholder loan of €6.5 million due to the capitalization of interest
on the loan, and an increase in interest payable on the Existing Revolving Credit Facility due to increased
drawings during the course of 2020 compared to 2019, partially offset by the effect of the repayment of the
second-lien ICA in July 2019.

_Other financial income and expenses_

Other financial income and expenses decreased by €1.3 million, from income of €0.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 expenses of €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was
primarily due to reduced non-monetary financial income and expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net impairment of financial assets related to depreciation on securities of
€0.5 million and on deposits and guarantees of €0.4 million. Net income of €0.3 million on unwinding
discounts reflects the time value of housing loans and is attributable to the decrease in the discount rate used,
from 0.7% in 2019 to 0.4% in 2020. Other expenses related primarily to agency and ratings agency fees as well
as fees related to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

_Income tax expense_

Income tax expense increased by €0.2 million, or 9.1%, from €2.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, to €2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher
Corporate Income Taxes.

(a) Our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been retrospectively restated for IFRS 16 Interpretations
Committee implementation. See “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain changes in
_accounting standards and accounting policies.”_

(b) Data for 2018 has not been restated to reflect the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16. We began applying IFRS 16 from
January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information. Under this approach,
a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted
for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. However, following additional analyses
carried out in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 15 (related to revenue from contracts with customers), in the year
ended December 31, 2019, we changed our accounting presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to
the reclassification of the contracts to be classified as contracts where we act as agent, as opposed to contracts where we act as
principal as was previously the case, and the statement of profit and loss figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been
restated accordingly. For further details see, “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain
_changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—2018 Restatement” and “—Results of Operations—Year ended December_
_31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.”_

(c) In 2018, net loss from discontinued operations concerned the impairment of Somhome assets after the business was discontinued.

_Revenue_

On a restated basis, revenue increased by €78.0 million, or 9.0%, from €865.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, to €943.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in total revenue
was mainly attributable to the impact of acquisitions carried out in 2019 for an amount of €73.2 million, an
increase of €14.7 million in organic growth apart from our acquisitions and a positive currency effect of €2.5
million related to our business in Switzerland, with the average EUR/CHF exchange rate decreasing from 1.16
in 2018 to 1.11 in 2019 partially offset by negative impact of registration fees for an amount of €8.6 million.

**Total revenue ...............................................................................................................** **943,546** **865,539**

Revenue for the RRES business, including our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Renting
businesses, increased by €36.0 million, or 6.7%, from €535.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to
€571.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to the increase in
revenue from our Joint Property Management business by €22.2 million, or 8.6%, from €258.9 million to €281.1
million and the increase in revenue from Lease Management and Renting by €13.4 million, or 5.0%, from
€270.3 million to €283.6 million. This increase was mainly driven by price effect in Joint Property
Management and in Lease Management, partially offset by customer turnover in Joint Property Management
and Lease Management, and a decline in market conditions for the rental activity in 2019.

Revenue for the Brokerage business (French network) increased by €11.3 million, or 9.5%, from €118 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily driven by higher organic Brokerage revenues as the result of strong market conditions in volume
and in pricing.

Revenue for the digital business segment increased by €12.8 million, or 56.6%, from €22.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018, to €35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily
driven by increased revenue from Efficity of €8.9 million notably due to the recruitment of new agents.

Revenue for the other activities segment increased throughout the period under review by €0.4 million, or 0.4%,
from €98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €99.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This increase was primarily driven by higher revenue from Assurimo due to the increased number of
buildings that we managed, partially offset by lower revenue deriving from the B2B segment.

Revenue for our International business increased by €17.6 million, or 19.4%, from €91.0 million to
€108.6 million. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenues in Switzerland, which were largely
the result of a positive currency effect in Switzerland of €2.5 million.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income increased by €0.9 million, or 16.9%, from €5.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, to €6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of other operating income for the periods indicated.

Miscellaneous .............................................................................................................. 954 793

**Total other operating income ...................................................................................** **6,143** **5,253**

The increase in other operating income from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31,
2019 was mainly attributable to the increase in gains on client accounts by €0.6 million or 72.4%, from €0.9
million to €1.5 million due to a specific workstream in connection with former client account revenues and
charges.

The increase in other operating income from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31,
2019 was also partly attributable to the increase in miscellaneous income – international entities by €0.3 million,
or 26.0%, from €1.0 million to €1.2 million primarily due to income recognized in Switzerland and the increase
in revenue from rebilled rent by €0.2 million, or 26.6%, from €0.6 million to €0.7 million and the decrease in
checks not yet debited – miscellaneous income by €266 thousand, or 100.0%, from €266 thousand to nil during
the period under review.

_Purchases consumed and external charges_

Purchases consumed and external charges decreased by €20.7 million, or 10.1%, from €204.6 million for the

**Total purchases consumed and external charges ....................................................** **(183,907)** **(204,645)**

The decrease in purchases consumed and external charges from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year
ended December 31, 2019 was mainly attributable to the decrease in cost of premises by €32.3 million, or
64.5%, from €50.0 million to €17.8 million because of the application of IFRS 16 which began in 2019 and the
decrease in subcontracting by €2.9 million, or 16.9%, from €17.0 million to €14.2 million, partly offset by the
increase in fees and services by €7.7 million, or 14%, from €55.3 million to €63.0 million due to the
development of Efficity leading to higher commissions paid to agents and the increase in IT purchases by €4.9

million, or 35.8%, from €13.7 million to €18.6 million due to investment in IT network and security and
telephone systems.

was mainly attributable to the increase in wages and salaries by €36.9 million, or 11.3%, from €325.8 million to
€362.8 million and the change in costs relating to movements in post-employment benefits from €3.7 million to
negative €1.0 million during the period under review.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses decreased slightly by €0.1 million, or 2.4%, from €5.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, to €5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other operating expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2019 have, as a percentage of revenue, remained consistent at 0.6% of revenue, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Total other operating expenses .................................................................................** **(5,250)** **(5,379)**

The decrease in other operating expenses from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended
December 31, 2019 was mainly attributable to the decrease in costs relating to commercial payments in respect
of French entities by €1.2 million, or 42.4%, from €2.8 million to €1.6 million, partially offset by the increase in
losses on client accounts in respect of French entities by €1.1 million, or 113.0%, from €0.9 million to €2
million due to specific workstreams in connection with former client account revenues and charges.

_Net additions to depreciation, amortization, impairment and provisions_

Net additions to depreciation, amortization, impairment and provisions increased by €41.4 million, or 81.8%,
from a loss of €50.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to a loss of €92.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

The increase in net additions to depreciation, amortization, impairment and provisions from the year ended
December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was mainly attributable to depreciation of right-of-use
assets of €40.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to zero in the year ended December 31,
2018, due to the application of IFRS 16 starting in 2019. The increase was also partially attributable to an
increase in amortization of intangible assets of €4.7 million from €38.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2018 to €43.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 related to an increase in the intangible assets due to
the implementation of IFRS 16.

_Non-recurring operating income (expenses)_

Non-recurring operating expenses increased by €40.5 million, or 120.6%, a net expense of €33.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018, to a net expense of €74.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Nonrecurring operating income (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2019 has, as a percentage of revenue,
increased to 7.8% of revenue, as compared to 3.9% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Total non-recurring operating income (expenses)** **(74,040)** **(45,113)** **(28,927)** **(33,564)**

The increase in non-recurring operating expenses was primarily attributable to the impairment of Foncia
Primaliance goodwill, which was classified as held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2019, and
integration costs, consisting of human resource costs for €12 million, chiefly relating to personnel costs incurred
in respect of rehires and severance costs for certain employees such as agreements, bonuses, negotiated
termination benefits and payroll taxes and other miscellaneous expenses totaling €6.9 million, including costs
related to unlocking synergies such as costs for redundant leases, moving costs and contract termination costs.
This increase was also partly driven by increased restructuring costs in France and an increase in acquisition
fees primarily related to fees paid to sellers or business providers for support services, market research fees and
accounting, legal and consulting assistance fees.

_Cost of gross debt_

Cost of gross debt increased by €4.1 million, or 4.1%, from €102.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, to €106.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Net income from cash and cash equivalents ..............................................................** – –

**Cost of net debt ............................................................................................................** **(106,224)** **(102,081)**

The increase in cost of gross debt from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019
was mainly attributable to the increase in interest on the shareholder loan by €5.9 million, or 11.9%, from
€49.4 million to €55.3 million attributable to the increase on the nominal amount and the increase in interest
relating to senior facility B by €5.5 million, or 19.4%, from €28.1 million to €33.5 million attributable to
additional drawdowns on this facility B in May 2019 of €178 million and in July 2019 of €110 million. The
increase in cost of gross debt was partly offset by the decrease in costs relating to the Second-lien ICA by
€8.0 million, or 64.1%, from €12.6 million to €4.5 million related to the repayment of €77 million on this
facility in August 2018, followed by the repayment of the remaining €110 million in July 2019.

_Other financial income and expenses_

Other financial income and expenses increased by €1.2 million to an income of €0.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, compared to an expense of €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of other financial income and expenses for the periods indicated:

**For the year ended**

**December 31,**

**€ 000’** **2019** **2018**

Foreign exchange gains (losses) .................................................................................... – 573
Net interest cost on pension and other employee benefit obligations ............................ (506) (336)
Capital gains (losses) on financial disposals less costs to sell ....................................... 355 (2)
Net impairment of financial assets ................................................................................ (269) 100
Gains (losses) on available-for-sale financial assets ...................................................... 287 961
Discounting cost, net ..................................................................................................... 1,088 (469)
Other ............................................................................................................................. (762) (1,790)
**Other financial income and expenses .........................................................................** **193** **(963)**

This increase in other financial income was driven by a decrease in other expenses in the year ended
December 31, 2019, which mainly concerned fees due on the early repayment of the Second-lien ICA loan for
€1.5 million. Additionally, discounting costs, net increased by €1.6 million from an expense of €0.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018, to €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which reflects the
time value of housing loans and is attributable to the decrease in the discount rate used, from 1.57% in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to 0.7% in the year ended December 31, 2019.


-----

This increase in other financial income was partially offset since no foreign exchange gains were recognized in
the year ended December 31, 2019. The foreign exchange gains in the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted
from fluctuations in CHF up to June 29, 2018, the date on which the net investment hedge was recognized in
respect of the loan granted to Foncia Switzerland by Foncia Group. Following this date, foreign exchange gains
and losses arising on the loan have been taken to other comprehensive income (equity) under foreign currency
translation reserves and therefore no longer impact profit or loss.

_Income tax expense_

Income tax expense decreased by €12.5 million, or 83.5%, from €15 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, to €2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of income tax expense for the periods indicated.

**For the year ended**

**December 31,**

**€ 000’** **2019** **2018**

Current tax expense excluding CVAE tax on value added ............................... (7,372) (2,222)
CVAE tax on value added ................................................................................ (9,841) (8,955)
Deferred taxes .................................................................................................. 14,737 (3,820)

**Income tax expense .........................................................................................** **(2,477)** **(14,997)**

The decrease in income tax benefit from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31,
2019 was mainly attributable to the change in income from deferred taxes from an expense of €3.8 million to an
income tax benefit of €14.7 million. This increase in deferred tax income recognized in year the ended
December 31, 2019 primarily relates to the decrease in the deferred tax rate in France, from 28.92% in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to 25.83% in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies_

Share of profit of equity-accounted companies increased €40 thousand to €15 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2019, compared to a loss of €25 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to
increased profitability of our joint venture, Pagardim.

_Net loss from discontinued operations_

Net loss from discontinued operations was €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to nil
for the year ended December 31, 2019. This loss in the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the
impairment of Somhome assets after the business was discontinued.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Our cash needs relate primarily to capital and
other expenditures for meeting debt service requirements and funding our working capital requirements, which
are primarily costs related to our acquisitions. The components of our working capital are trade receivables and
deferred income, trade payables and prepaid expenses, tax and employee related working capital. We believe
that, based on our current cash flows, these sources of liquidity, together with existing available borrowings
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditure and debt
service for at least the next 12 months.

We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of the Issue Date, after giving effect
to the Transactions, we expect to have €2,099 million of indebtedness, comprising primarily of the Notes, the
New Term Loan Facility and lease liabilities. We will also be able to borrow up to €437.5 million under the
New Revolving Credit Facility. The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon certain
conditions described further under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”

The Indenture governing the Notes offered hereby will contain, and the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
will contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future opportunities and capital needs,
or pursue business opportunities and activities. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility also requires us
to comply with a leverage ratio, under certain circumstances, in order for us to continue to be able to draw funds
under the Revolving Credit Facility. We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding
debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such


-----

repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and
other factors.

Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent
on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the other factors discussed in “—Key Factors Affecting Results of
_Operations” and “Risk Factors.” We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flows_
from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable
us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

**_Cash flows_**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, as well as short-term highly-liquid deposits with
an initial maturity of three months or less and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The table
below sets forth certain information related to our cash flows:

_Cash flow from operating activities_

Our cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to an inflow of
€171.6 million, primarily due to our EBITDA which amounted to €241.3 million, partially offset by
non-recurring operating costs in the amount of €55.4 million primarily driven by the increased number of
bolt-on acquisitions, negative change in working capital in the amount of €8.1 million and paid CIT / CVAE in
the amount of €10.8 million.

Our cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to an inflow of
€183.4 million, primarily due to EBITDA in the amount of €251.9 million, partially offset by negative change in

mainly driven by the increased number of bolt-on acquisitions and paid CIT / CVAE in the amount of
€11.5 million.

Our cash flow from (used in) operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to an inflow
of €129.7 million, primarily due to EBITDA in the amount of €191.2 million, partially offset by negative change
in working capital in the amount of €19.9 million due to a VAT credit improvement in 2017 and lower
employee bonuses and profit-sharing and by non-recurring operating costs in the amount of €31.0 million
primarily driven by the number of bolt-on acquisitions and paid CIT / CVAE in the amount of €5.9 million.

_Cash flow from (used in) investing activities_

Our cash flow from (used in) in investing activities principally relates to bolt-on acquisitions of companies
operating in our RRES businesses and capital expenditure (such as IT projects).

Our cash flow from (used in) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to an outflow
of €211.1 million, primarily due to the intangible and tangible fixed assets expenditure in the amount of
€57.6 million, acquisitions of companies primarily operating in our RRES businesses in the amount of
€156.1 million.


-----

Our cash flow from (used in) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to an outflow

€60.3 million and acquisitions of companies primarily operating in our RRES businesses in the amount of
€70.5 million (this includes the disposal of non-RRES businesses).

Our cash flow from (used in) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to an outflow
of €145.8 million, primarily due to intangible and tangible fixed assets expenditure in the amount of
€51.7 million, acquisitions of companies primarily operating in our RRES businesses in the amount of
€100.9 million.

_Cash flow from (used in) financing activities_

Our cash flow from (used in) financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to an outflow
of €6.7 million, primarily due to the payment of financial interests in the amount of €49.1 million,
reimbursement of leases in the amount of €43.2 million and €120 million drawn under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility.

Our cash flow from (used in) financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to an inflow

**Working Capital**

Working capital consists of inventory, trade receivables and deferred income, trade payables and prepaid
expenses, tax and employee related working capital. The following table sets forth our change in adjusted net
working capital for the periods indicated.

**Year ended December 31,**

**(in thousands of euros)** **2020** **2019** **2018**
**Working capital – inventories ........................................................** **250** **277** **249**
**Working capital – trade receivables and deferred income ..........** **85,229** **82,869** **83,074**
Trade receivables .......................................................................... 102,476 99,589 99,145
Deferred income ........................................................................... (17,247) (16,721) (16,071)
**Working capital – trade payables and prepaid expenses .............** **(104,626)** **(101,827)** **(107,567)**
Trade payables .............................................................................. (109,678) (104,794) (112,381)
Prepaid expenses ........................................................................... 5,046 2,908 4,814
**Working capital – tax ......................................................................** **17,123** **22,114** **25,079**
**Working capital – employee-related ..............................................** **(130,711)** **(103,531)** **(92,651)**
**Operating working capital ..............................................................** **(132,735)** **(100,098)** **(91,817)**
**Non-operating working capital ......................................................** **10,983** **(913)** **194**
**Consolidated working capital (excluding income tax) ..................** **(121,752)** **(101,011)** **(91,622)**

The increase in working capital spend from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31,
2020 was related to an increase of the tax working capital of €5.0 million, an increase of the employee-related
working capital of €27.2 million and an increase of the non-operating working capital of €10.0 million mainly
due to remaining payments on acquisitions.

Trade receivables increased by €2.9 million or 2.9% from December 21, 2019 to December 21, 2020 primarily
due to changes in consolidation scope. DSO remained at approximately 38 days, which is an equivalent level to
that of 2019. Trade payables increased by €4.9 million or 4.7% from December 21, 2019 to December 21,
2020, also primarily due to changes in consolidation scope. Tax working capital was comprised primarily of tax
credits related to a former French tax credit for employment (the Crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et
l’emploi or “CICE”) of €20.1 million, net VAT credits of €1.7 million and taxes assessed on compensation of
€3.0 million. Employee-related working capital principally comprised of payables to personnel of €66.9
million, net payables to government social welfare agencies and earn-out debts of €28 million. The increase of


-----

€27.2 million in employee-related working capital is mainly due to (i) an increase in payables to personnel of
€10 million, (ii) an increase in net payable to government social welfare agencies of €2.5 million.

**Off-balance Sheet Commitments**

Under the provisions of the Hoguet law, property management companies must provide financial guarantees for
funds held in client accounts. In accordance with this law, we provide financial guarantees to clients equal to
the maximum amount of funds held on their account. These guarantees are presented under commitments
given. Commitments given for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were €2.3 billion,
€1.9 billion and €2.1 billion, respectively, for these Professional Financial Guarantees and total commitments
for the same periods were €6.1 billion, €5.5 billion and €5.7 billion, respectively, including property lease
commitments, commitments under financing leases and pledges of certain collateral.

Financial guarantees received from guarantors such as guarantee funds, insurance companies and banks are
shown under commitments received. Total commitments received for the years ended December 31, 2020,
2019 and 2018 were €3.0 billion, €2.3 billion and €3.0 billion, respectively, including commitments under
property lease commitments, commitments under financing leases and pledges of certain collateral.

**Employee Pensions**

In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which we operate, we participate in, or
operate, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to
eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Virtually all of our employees are
entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by us to the beneficiaries when the rights
allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds financed in compliance with the
applicable government requirements and regulations. These plans may be funded by investments in various
instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds.

**Client Accounts**

We conduct our property management business through mandates signed with customers, under which our
companies are responsible for holding client funds. By law, all Joint Property Management accounts are
segregated and each individual association must open a current account and a saving account for client funds.
These funds consist of guarantee deposits received, rent and expenses and capital and renovation funds. As an
agent, we undertake to hold client accounts and to recognize them in our statement of financial position using a
specific account for each activity, such as property sales, rentals and management.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. Our treasury
department is responsible for managing our exposure to market risk that arises in connection with operations
and financial activities, including interest rate, foreign exchange rate, credit and liquidity, and credit risk
management.

The following sections discuss our significant exposures to market risk. The following discussions do not
address other risks that we face in the normal course of business, including country risk and legal risk.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Our interest rate risk exposure arises mainly on our borrowings. These borrowings are denominated solely in
euros and are managed on a centralized basis. They are mainly indexed to three-month EURIBOR. The risk
management policy is set by our management team.

Cash flow surpluses and working capital requirements for our companies are centralized under a cash pooling
agreement and managed by our treasury department. Our treasury department selects investment vehicles for
cash surpluses – either for proprietary cash or client cash (excluding separate accounts) – within the framework
set by the management policy, which prioritizes liquidity and security. Interest received is indexed to 3-month
EURIBOR or is at fixed rates (term accounts).

At December 31, 2020, interest rate risks can be broken down by management outlook as follows, taking into
account interest rate maturities applied to the asset/liability financing position:

**Credit risk** **€ thousands**
Client accounts ........................................................................................................................................... 554,011

 - Term accounts (client funds) .................................................................................................................... (161,078)
+ Net cash and cash equivalents ................................................................................................................. 51,664
**Assets .........................................................................................................................................................** **444,597**

 - Credit line ................................................................................................................................................ (1,872,732)
+ Interest rate cap ....................................................................................................................................... 660,000

 - CICE ........................................................................................................................................................ (8,852)
**Liabilities ...................................................................................................................................................** **(1,221,584)**
**Net position ...............................................................................................................................................** **(776,987)**

The Group set up a new rate hedging amounting to €660 million by purchasing a new 1% strike CAP against
3-month EURIBOR (12-month maturity).

The premium paid for this instrument amounted to €0.039 million. Given the current environment for interbank
rates (negative 3-month EURIBOR), the fair value of this instrument is zero at December 31, 2020.

**_Foreign exchange risk_**

We are exposed to two types of foreign exchange risk:

    - A foreign exchange risk on assets resulting from our shareholdings in our Swiss subsidiaries.
Although this risk is measured, it is not subject to specific risk management as the investments
are intended to be held over the long term. Our foreign exchange risk exposure on assets is
not material.

    - A foreign exchange trading risk arising on commercial and financial transactions carried out
by our companies in currencies other than their local currency. This risk arises solely on the
business of Swiss subsidiaries and concerns the Swiss franc. Since the vast majority of local
transactions are carried out in Swiss francs, this risk is not material.

**Critical Accounting Judgments**

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the
measurement and presentation of certain assets and liabilities and any disclosures provided in respect of
contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses
for the period.


-----

Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting
period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given
the circumstances. These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Where applicable, a sensitivity analysis may be performed
if the estimates are material. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern
assumption and relate primarily to the items described below.

_Measurements used in testing goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment_

The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and
property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and
determine the discount rates used.

As with any estimate, the assumptions used in these calculations are partly based on uncertain factors and may
therefore need to be adjusted in subsequent periods. The notes to the audited financial statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum set out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and
determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity
analyses were also performed and are described in the same notes.

_Measurement of leases_

IFRS 16 requires entities to use a significant degree of judgement as well as certain key estimates. These
involve determining:

    - whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised;

    - the lease term;

    - the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments; and

    - the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the
contract.

The main assumptions we use to prepare the audited financial statements are described in the notes to the
audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Measurement of provisions_

We use the best estimate of our commitments and obligations to calculate the corresponding provisions.

_Measurement of employee benefits_

We operate both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated
using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future
increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs.

The notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum set out the
assumptions used to measure these obligations. We consider that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate
and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these
assumptions also change.

_Measurement of fair value (Level 1)_

We use fair value on a recurring basis in our statement of financial position to measure unlisted derivative
instruments and cash and cash equivalents.

_Measurement of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax expense_

Our tax position is based on our best estimate of future taxable earnings.


-----

_Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business_
_combination_

The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and
liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount
rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount.

_Assessment of criteria for identifying discontinued operations_

In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, we are required to
exercise judgement in determining whether an asset or group of assets meets the criteria to be classified as held
for sale. IFRS 5 criteria are also used to identify any assets to be classified as discontinued operations. These
assessments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in light of changes in the relevant facts and
circumstances.

In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, we use our judgement to define
and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the
financial statements:

    - present a true and fair view of our financial position, financial performance and cash flows;

    - reflect the economic substance of transactions; and

    - are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects.

We are the European leader in the residential real estate services market, providing services to both individuals
(“business-to-consumer” or “B2C”) and businesses (“business-to-business” or “B2B”), and have recently
entered the commercial real estate services segment for B2B customers. We assist our residential and
commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with competitive and comprehensive service
offerings.

**Overview of addressable markets**

The property management business in France provides a wide range of services from core property management
services (lease management and joint property management) to providing ancillary services to property owners.

**_Lease management and joint property management_**

Property management companies’ core offering is composed of lease management services and joint property
management services.

The lease management business includes i) residential property management (gestion locative), i.e. services for
an apartment or a house, and ii) commercial property management, i.e. services for retail buildings, notably
shops and restaurants. It refers to the assistance on the day-to-day operations of the property typically related to
financial management, legal assistance, conflict handling, etc., for an individual residential unit (which may be a
joint property or condominium). On the lease management level, property management companies take care of
tenancy agreements, rent collection, account and reporting, tax and insurance claims, maintenance or legal
compliance. The property management providers are appointed by the owner of the individual unit(s), typically
a private landlord.

Joint property management refers to the management of joint property (copropriété), i.e. the management of
shared property of joint ownership associations, activities include financial management, structural support and
legal assistance. In the joint property management segment, the services provided include organization of
general assemblies, a pre-determined number of visits per year for inspection, coordination of maintenance
efforts and accounting, bill payment, and building fee collection. The property management provider assumes
the role of trustee (syndic) after appointment by the general assembly of joint owners. It is important to note
that lease management and joint property management activities can overlap with each other and fall under joint
property management for the joint property and lease management for the individual unit.

-----

Property management companies provide residential real estate services to B2C and B2B clients. The business
model has different maturity levels in different geographies, for instance, B2B property management services
are far more developed in Germany than in France where this segment is still growing significantly, notably
following the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Main Customers_

Property management companies address a variety of customers that can be divided into three main groups
depending on the type of services provided to them. Typical lease management customers are private landlords
and family offices. Private landlords are private individuals with real estate portfolios varying in size. They
own the majority of residential units and a very small portion of office and retail buildings. Family offices are
individuals who own a real estate portfolio, mainly composed of apartments and to a lesser extent, office and
retail buildings.

Typical joint property management customers are joint ownership associations or their boards, representing
owners of a single property containing multiple units, such as apartments buildings.

Typical B2B clients are institutional investors that acquire and manage real estate portfolios such as Axa,
Allianz, BNP Paribas or Swiss Life. These portfolios can be composed of apartments, office or retail buildings.

**Market size**

The size of the property markets differs depending on the country as well as the size of the addressable markets
for property management companies. Property management companies’ penetration rates varies among the
markets (residential vs. commercial) and the different types of owners.

**_France_**

In France, as of August 2019, the total market size for property management was estimated to be €12.2 billion,
of which €5.3 billion (44%) was under external management.

In 2019, the residential market was the largest segment of the French property management market, estimated to
be €10.3 billion (84% of the French property management market), of which the lease management had an
estimated market size of €8.1 billion and joint property management had an estimated market size of €2.2
billion. The commercial market, estimated to be €1.9 billion (16% of the French property management market),
includes the lease management service for offices, (representing 211 million square meters for an average
annual rent price of €192 per square meters and an average property management fee of 3% of rent) and retail
(representing 152 million square meters for an average annual rent price of €152 per square meters and an
average property management fee of 3% of rent).

The majority of the French property market is not captured by property management companies, with services
instead being managed “in-house.” The market that is captured by property management companies has an
estimated total market size of €5.3 billion (44% of the French property management market), and is shared
between the lease management providers with an estimated market size of €3.4 billion market, (64% of the
captured market) and the condominium management providers with an estimated market size of €1.9 billion
(36% of the captured market). Based on penetration rates, property management companies benefit from a
strong position in the commercial market, having penetrated 90% of both the market for lease management of


-----

office and retail spaces. Their penetration is more balanced in the residential market where it varies widely by
the type of customer. The penetration rates for institutional investors is 90% and for condominiums 85%, while
private landlords and the secondary and vacant homes are yet to be captured as the penetration rates are low at
30% and 10%, respectively.

In 2019, the total residential stock building was comprised 35.8 million units. Among these units, roughly two
thirds of total dwellings are either owner-occupied (17.0 million units), social housing or “free” housing
(5.7 million units) and not addressable for external property management. Therefore, the total addressable
residential stock buildings for property management companies is 13.1 million units or 37% of the total
residential stock buildings. As of August 2019, property management companies have only captured
approximately 2.8 million units or 21% of the residential total addressable market. The majority of the
penetrated market are owned by private landlords (1.9 million units or 68% of the penetrated market), 200,000
penetrated units (9% of the penetrated market) are owned by institutional investors and 600,000 units (23% of
the penetrated market) are secondary and vacant homes.

In 2019, among the 35.8 million units of the French residential market, 25.9 million units were single ownership
(72% of the residential total building stock), and not considered relevant for joint property management. The
remaining 9.9 million units (28% of the residential total building stock) were condominiums and part of a joint
ownership structure (copropriétés). These joint ownership structures include a mix of owned, rented, vacant
and secondary dwellings (typically apartments). The vast majority (85%) of these joint ownership associations
were managed by external property managers, meaning an estimated 8.4 million condominiums were under
external property management, with the remaining 1.5 million units were to be captured by property
management companies.

**_Switzerland_**

In Switzerland, as of August 2019, the total market size for property management was estimated to be
€2.1 billion, of which €1.1 billion (52%) is under external management.

In 2019, the residential market was the largest segment of the Swiss property management market, estimated to
be €1.6 billion (77% of the total Swiss property management market). This segment comprised 4.5 million units
owned by condominium owners, private landlords, public sector rental, housing companies, institutional
investors and cooperative ownership.

Property management companies do not yet hold a strong position in all the segments of the residential and
commercial markets based on their penetration rates. In the commercial market, as of August 2019, property
management companies have penetrated 80% of retail space and 40% of the office space segment. Similarly,
property management companies have varying penetration rates among the various segments of the residential
market. For example, 80% of properties were owned by institutional investors, 70% by condominium owners,
65% by real estate companies, 10% by public sector rentals, 10% by cooperative ownership properties and 30%
by private landlords.

In 2019, the total Swiss residential stock building was comprised 4.6 million units, of which roughly a quarter of
total dwellings are single or two family homes (1.2 million units) and therefore, not addressable for the external
property management business. Therefore, the total addressable residential stock amounted to 3.4 million units
or 74% of the total residential stock building. Property management companies have captured half of the
addressable market with 1.8 million units or 52% of the residential total addressable market. Penetration is the
highest among institutional investors as well as construction and real estate companies and the lowest among
housing cooperatives and the public sector, where property management is typically carried out in-house
department.

In 2019, the residential market was the largest segment of the German property management market, estimated
to be €8.0 billion (80% of the German property management market). This segment consisted of estimated 42.4
million units owned by owners associations, housing associations, public sector housing, private landlords and
professional companies. The average revenue per unit was €263. The commercial market was estimated to be
€2.0 billion (20% of the German property management market) and comprised office properties (representing
400 million square meters for an average annual rent price of €118 per square meters and an average property
management fee of 2.7% of rent) retail spaces (representing 122 million square meters for an average annual
rent price of €250 per square meters and an average property management fee of 2.4% of rent). Similar to
France, the majority of this German property market was not captured by property management companies, with
services instead being managed “in-house.” Property management accounted for €3.7 billion (37% of the
German property management market) of the total addressable market. Companies benefit from a strong
position in the commercial market having penetrated 75% of office space and 75% of the retail space.
Penetration by property management companies was lower in the residential market, with penetration rates
being equal or below to 50% for all sub-segments as follows: owners associations (50% penetration rate),
private landlord (50%), professional companies (25%) and public sector housing (5%).

In 2019, the total German residential stock building was composed of 42.4 million units. Of these, half of total
dwellings were not addressable for external property management which comprise of owner-occupied houses
(13.7 million), houses owned by private landlords (5.4 million) or houses owned by housing associations
(2.2 million). Therefore, the residential total addressable stock amounted to 21.0 million units (50% of the total
residential stock building). In 2019, property management companies captured a quarter of the addressable
market with an estimated 5.6 million units under management (27% of the residential total addressable market).
Penetration was the highest among ownership associations and private landlords as the German Condominium
Act applies for WEG management.

**Key growth drivers in the lease management and joint property management businesses**

As of August 2019, the addressable market of our lease management and joint property management businesses
in France grew at an estimated 2% per annum between 2014 to 2019. In Germany and Switzerland, the
addressable market for our lease management and joint property management businesses grew at an estimated
1.5% to 3% per annum between 2014 and 2019. The joint property management market is driven by three
factors: pricing, building activities and outsourcing penetration for property management.

**France**

The property management market has seen an estimated annual growth rate of approximately 2%, from
€4.82 billion in 2014 to €5.32 billion in 2019. Within the property management market, residential lease
management grew at the fastest pace (growing from €1.49 billion in 2014 to €1.71 billion in 2019 with a CAGR
of 2.8%), followed by joint property management (growing from €1.71 billion in 2014 to €1.90 billion in 2019
with a CAGR of 2.1%) and commercial lease management (growing from €1.61 billion in 2014 to €1.72 billion
in 2019 with a CAGR of 1.3%).

Between 2019 and 2024, the property management market in France is expected to grow an estimated rate of
approximately 1 to 2% per annum, to reach €5.87 billion in 2024 (excluding the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic). Continued growth is expected to be driven by the residential lease management segment and joint
property management segment, with commercial lease management following historical trends. The growth
outlook is expected to be driven by a larger number of addressable units and higher penetration of units owned
by private landlords as a result of regulatory changes which have made it more difficult for private landlords to
manage properties in-house. However, certain aspects of this expected growth may be decreased by
uncertainties regarding the full price effect of recent regulatory changes and new entrants.

The private housing market in France has grown steadily since 2000 at a CAGR of 1.2% and as at 2019 had not
been affected by the global financial crisis as shown below:

**_Pricing_**

As of August 2019, prices for residential lease management are expected to grow between 1 to 2% per annum
between 2019 and 2024 (excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), although impact from recent and
future housing reform regulations remains unclear. Pricing for lease management is typically fixed as a
percentage of rent (ranging from 2 to 10%, and on average 6 to 8% of annual rent). While prices in terms of
percentages have remained stable, rent for residential real estate grew at 0.7% per annum from 2013 to 2019,
with a trend of increased acceleration in recent past (1.7% from 2018 to 2019).

Recent developments make it difficult to estimate possible pricing scenarios in the near future. For example,
rent limitation was re-enacted in Paris since July 2019, which set a 20% limit for premium over reference rent in
each district, is expected to curb the upward trend for rent significantly. Furthermore, the impact of any future
regulatory housing reforms is unclear. As shown by recent housing reforms, regulations can have significant
impacts on rent price. This is in addition to the ongoing uncertainty of the impact of the general economic
disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prices for joint property management are expected to grow at 1 to 2% per annum between 2019 and 2024
(excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), in line with inflation. Prices for joint property management
range from approximately €100 to €400/unit and depend on a variety of factors, including size of the portfolio,
included services, location and characteristics of the property. Prices have typically been increasing by 1 to 2%
per annum between 2014 and 2019, in line with inflation. This trend is expected to continue However, this does
not account for any disruptions that may stem from the general economic disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic.

Prices for Commercial Lease Management are expected to stay flat between 2019 and 2024 (excluding the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), reflecting the competitive pressure from tendering process. Rent levels in
the commercial segment vary significantly and pricing tends to be negotiated through a competitive tender
process where price points are determined on a global level, based on the characteristics and requirements of the
building(s) in the portfolio. In general, prices for commercial property management have remained rather stable
between 2014 and 2019.

**_Building activity_**

Building activities are expected to account for an estimated growth of 0.5 to 1% per annum between 2019 and
2024.

Expenditure for residential building activity grew at an estimated 3% per annum from 2017 to 2019, and is
expected to correct for recent boom years and decrease by 3% per annum from 2019 to 2021, thereby returning
to 2016 levels. However, despite decreases in total expenditure, residential stock is expected to continue to
grow towards 2022 at an estimated 1% annually. The share of addressable market for property management
businesses (excluding social housing and owner occupied units) is expected to remain stable in the same period.
Growth for joint properties is expected to be in line with overall residential building stock growth at
approximately 1% till 2022. This remains subject to any impact that may stem from the general economic
disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the number of building permits, the total number of

Expenditure on commercial building is expected to increase at 2% per annum until 2022, at a slightly slower
pace than in the past few years, whereas expenditures on office building increase is expected to increase at 4%
per annum until 2022, slowing down from previous levels of 8% per annum between 2015 to 2019. However,
the expected growth of retail and office buildings addressable for external property management was minimal
between 0.5 to 1% from 2014 to 2018. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the commercial segment was expected
to grow a little slower than residential at 0.5 to 1% between 2019 and 2024, in line with growth in the previous
five years. This remains subject to any impact that may stem from the general economic disruption caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to undermine the growth of the commercial segment.

**_Outsourcing penetration_**

Penetration of property management outsourcing is expected to grow for residential lease management, mainly
driven by an increase in private landlords engaging management services. The penetration rate (the degree to
which property owners outsource property management rather than conduct activities in-house) for residential
lease management varies significantly depending on the type of owners. Penetration within private landlords
and secondary and vacant homes is relatively low at approximate 30% and 10% respectively as of 2019,
whereas for institutional investors and commercial segment, the penetration rate is at approximately 90% as of
2019.

As a result of more complex regulations (including PINEL, ALUR, ELAN), there has been a higher tendency
among private landlords to outsource property management, as it has become increasingly difficult, time
consuming and risky to keep property management in-house. These developments are expected to continue to
cause some increases in penetration until 2024. This remains subject to any impact that may stem from the
general economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Penetration for institutional investors and for the commercial segment is expected to remain stable given already
elevated current levels. Secondary and vacant homes are often used for private or short-term purposes, thus
penetration is expected to remain low.

As of August 2019, penetration of outsourcing of joint property management for condominiums was estimated
to be high at 85%, and is expected to remain stable at the current level till 2024.

**Other countries**

Foncia has operations in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. Between 2019 to 2024, the
property management market is expected to grow at approximately 1.5 to 2% per annum in Switzerland and 2.5
to 3% per annum in Germany.

**_Switzerland_**

Historically, the property management market in Switzerland grew at an estimated 1.5 to 2% per annum, from
€1.00 billion in 2015 to €1.07 billion in 2019, and is expected to grow at a similar pace in the near future,
reaching €1.17 billion in 2024. This remains subject to any impact that may stem from the general economic
disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Main drivers for growth of the sector in Switzerland are expected to be building activity (which is expected to
grow at an estimated rate of 1.2% per annum between 2019 and 2024) and to a lesser extent outsourcing
penetration (which is expected to grow at an estimated rate of 0.6% per annum between 2019 and 2024). Unlike
in France, in Switzerland, the prices have been decreasing slightly between 2014 to 2019, driven by the decrease
in percentages charged on the rent, despite increasing rent levels. In the near future, pricing in terms of
percentage of rent is not expected to decrease at the same pace given the already low level. An additional
upside could potentially be realized through ancillary services. Overall, prices are not expected to have a
significant impact on the growth prospects for the property management market in Switzerland.

**_Germany_**

The property management market in Germany grew at an estimated rate of 3% per annum, from €3.24 billion in
2015 to €3.66 billion in 2019. In the near future, the market is expected to grow at approximately 2.5 to 3% per
annum between 2019 and 2024, largely in line with historical levels, reaching €4.18 billion in 2024. This
remains subject to any impact that may stem from the general economic disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic.

Price increases are expected to be the main growth driver (approximately 1.1% per annum between 2019 and
2024), with some contributions from building activity (approximately 0.7% per annum between 2019 and 2024)


-----

and to a lesser extent outsourcing penetration (approximately 0.3% per annum between 2019 and 2024). Prices
have increased across residential and commercial segments in the recent past between 2015 and 2019, driven by
mostly by increasing rent (especially for office spaces, driven by shortage). These trends are expected to
continue in the near future. Unlike in France or Switzerland, outsourcing activity in the German market has not
followed a clear trend and is not expected to do so in the short term.

In Belgium and Luxembourg, the company’s current operations are relatively small compared to other markets
limiting the impact of market growth trends on the overall business.

**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the growth drivers**

Despite the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the residential real estate services market had proven to be
resilient during 2020, supported by reassuring factors that continued stable and growing momentum.

In France, transactions slowed down during the first half of 2020 due to government confinement measures that
were in place between March and May 2020. All real estate agencies and notaries were closed and, as a
consequence, the steady growth of housing transactions halted during that period. In July 2020, the trailing 12
months sales volumes of existing properties came down to 983,000 units, compared to 1,075,000 units in
January 2020. In comparison, in January 2018, sales volumes stood at 972,000 units.

During the second half of the year, the transaction market recovered to reach one million units (over 12 months).
In November 2020, the trailing 12 months transactions level was at 1,020,000 units, which was a decrease of 5%
compared to the levels recorded in January 2020.

Over the same period, despite the relative absence of foreign investors in the French market (close to its lowest
levels in 10 years), house prices continued their steady growth trajectory. In the second and third quarters of
2020, house prices were higher than in the previous quarters, by +1.2% and +0.7% respectively. When
compared to 2019, year-on-year evolution of house prices during the second and third quarter were +5.4% and
+5.0% respectively.

In 2021, FNAIM, which represents Real Estate agents in France, predicted that house prices will continue to
grow by +3.5% per annum in the near future.

Through 2020, leasing activity was halted due to several sanitary measures, constraining tenants’ ability to
change their housing. During the first three quarters of 2020, according to INSEE, rent followed the same path
as house prices. In the second and third quarter of 2020, the quarterly increases were +0.7% and +0.5%,
respectively. The fourth quarter of 2020 saw a flattening of rent prices (at -0.1% quarter over quarter), however
rent levels remain higher than what was observed by the end of 2019.


Exhibit 14: Rent index evolution


_Source: INSEE_

Finally, a new housing trend has emerged from the various constraining measures. There has been a shift
among the urban population towards preferring greener areas as observed by Notaires de France. The
experience of confinement and the already crowded urban hubs have pushed increasing numbers of homeowners
and tenants to seek more rural properties, with gardens and greater interior space. This move from urban to
sub-urban areas has also been reinforced by the possibility of undertaking and maintaining professional
activities remotely. As a result, for real estate servicers, scale and the capillarity of their network became key to
take advantage of this new housing habit.

In summary, the residential segment has remained resilient through the COVID-19 pandemic while other
segments of the real estate services market, such as offices or retail, have been negatively impacted by the
proliferation of working from home practices or by the acceleration of e-commerce adoption due to
government-ordered closure of certain physical shops. This resilience and relative outperformance has led
intuitional investors to increase their exposure in residential assets, thus benefitting the B2B customer segment.

The French real estate services market is highly fragmented, with a few large players and a long tail of
independent small and local providers. The increasing barriers to entry with regulations and growing
technological requirements make it difficult for small players to remain competitive.

_The French brokerage market_

The French brokerage market is highly fragmented, with few large players and a long tail of very small
agencies. The main players can be divided into four main categories:

    - _Traditional real estate agency networks (physical) gather a network of several agencies. Most_
of them opt for franchising that enable them to develop quickly and inexpensively. Only six
networks exceed 500 locations in France (Century 21, Foncia, Guy Hoquet’Immobilier,
Laforêt Immobilier, Orpi and Stéphane Plaza Immobilier);

    - _Real estate agency networks (online), mainly carry out their activity online, enabling them to_
propose lower commission rates as they do not operate a network of physical agencies. The
seven predominant networks are IAD, Safti, Capifrance, Propriétés-Privées.com, OptimHome,
Efficity (a subsidiary of Foncia Group) and MegAgence;

    - _Independent online agencies offer fixed commissions and are challenging the codes of the real_
estate services market. Still few players (a dozen on the French market), these start-ups are
essentially present in Île-de-France and in some large cities (Lyon, Bordeaux, etc.);

    - _Specialized agents for the luxury segment coming from dominant specialized agencies_
distinguished by a significant international presence. Predominant examples are Barnes and
Emile Garcin.

The Swiss market is relatively fragmented, with a few large players and a long tail of small, local providers.
The players can be divided into four main categories:

    - _Independent property management companies, including us, with core offering of property_
management services for both the commercial and residential segments, without a clear
separation. They also provide brokerage and other services such as facility management.
Other predominant examples of companies in this category are Privera and Averit;

    - _Institutionally owned property managers are large, nationwide companies, owned by_
institutional investors or real estate companies like Swiss Prime Site, SwissLife or Pensimo.
They often offer property management services to third parties, in addition to managing their
own portfolios, such as brokerage and other services (commercial letting or technical
consulting). Predominant examples are Wincasa, Livit and Regimo;

    - _Local associates of international real estate advisors are originally Swiss property_
management companies that have partnered with an international real estate advisor, having
often two local associates: one for French speaking Switzerland and one for German speaking
Switzerland. They usually also offer brokerage services and other services. Predominant
examples are Intercity and Real Estate AG;

    - _Small scale property management companies are small and local providers of property_
management, mainly targeting private investors and offering property management and coownership association services. They are typically family businesses or owner-operated
companies with less than 10 employees, with most of the business focused on a single
municipality or city. They represent almost 50% of the market. Predominant examples are
Geminwo and Martaler.

There are no actors with significant scale in the German residential property management market and the top 10
hold a combined 4% market share. The players can be divided into four main categories:

    - _Property management companies, including us, with core offering of property management._
Most of the larger players focus on commercial property management while having some
residential units ‘on the side’. They also provide brokerage and other services such as facility
management. Other predominant examples of companies in this category are ECE, DIM, IC
Immobilien Gruppe, Treureal and Tectareal;

    - _Full-service real estate advisors operate internationally as “one-stop-shop.” They secure_
stable income streams. They also provide other services (asset management or facility
management). Predominant examples are JLL, BNPP RE, CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield;

    - _Facility management-evolved companies, the core offering of which is facility management,_
moving gradually more into provision of property management to complement the low-margin
facility management business with broader services. Predominant examples are Strabag,
Apleona and Property First;

     - _Small-scale property management companies are small companies with “WEG-management”_
(acting according to the German Condominium Act (“Wohneigentumsgesetz” – WEG), which
constitutes the basis for all legal regulations involving individual freehold ownership incl. the
management of condominiums) as core business. They also provide property management
and gradually move more into property management of commercial space. They are typically
owner-operated, with an average of less than 10 employees with most of the business focused
around a municipality or a city. They represent more than 80% of the market. Predominant
examples are Jürgens Hausverwaltung GmbH and Kaldox Immobilien.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the European leader in the residential real estate services (“RRES”) market, providing services to both
individuals (“business-to-consumer” or “B2C”) and businesses (“business-to-business” or “B2B”), and have
recently entered the commercial real estate services segment for B2B customers. In addition, we have
established ourselves as a leader for real estate services in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and
Luxembourg by delivering high quality, reliable and innovative products uniquely suited to the needs of our
customers. We assist our residential and commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with
competitive and comprehensive service offerings. We provide end-to-end assistance, from managing individual
apartments and building areas jointly owned by apartment owners through our lease management and joint
property management business lines, respectively, to providing renting, brokerage and digital and ancillary
services such as insurance brokerage, technical diagnostic, and distribution and energy brokerage offerings
through our other business lines. Our RRES business is the leader in France, operating under the Foncia brand
through a network of approximately 134 and 131 branches dedicated to our RRES and Brokerage businesses,
respectively, and 242 branches dedicated to both our RRES and Brokerage businesses, representing 84% of our
revenue in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. We operate an additional 101 branches under various
brands in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our
French RRES business, Brokerage business, ancillary services, Digital services, B2B services and international
business generated 60%, 13%, 6%, 4%, 4% and 13% of our total revenue, respectively.

Our business lines include:

    - Residential Real Estate Services (“RRES”):

        - _Joint property management (our “JPM business”): In our Joint Property_
Management business, we are mandated by landlords to manage jointly owned
building areas and equipment and to ensure compliance with joint ownership
regulations. We are the French market leader in Joint Property Management,
managing over 1,463,402 dwellings in France for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We are generally hired by an apartment building homeowners’ board to provide
common services to all residents under contracts that are typically one year in length,
subject to renewal. Services in our Joint Property Management business include the
administrative, financial and technical management of the building, works
management, managing security staff and ensuring the maintenance of technical
equipment such as elevators, heating and safety systems. We also coordinate the
payment of common costs, transfer tasks, help brokers with the management of joint
decisions, offer cost management services such as efficiencies with respect to energy,
maintenance and heating costs, and provide asset appraisal services, as well as
around-the-clock maintenance assistance. These fee-based services in our Joint
Property Management business provide recurring and predictable revenue streams
with revenue of €65.9 million. Through our growth strategy, which includes both
acquisitions and organic growth initiatives, we have gone from managing 1,287,611
dwellings in France in 2018 to 1,463,402 dwellings in France as of December 31,
2020.

        - _Lease management and renting (our “LM&R business”): Through our Lease_
Management and Renting business, we manage properties on behalf of our ownerlessor customers (the lease management side of the Lease Management and Renting
business) and assist landlords and tenants throughout their rental process, including
the finding, screening and contracting of new tenants (the “renting” side of the Lease
Management and Renting business). In Lease Management, we assist landlords with
the day-to-day operations of the property, collect rent, offer financial reporting
services and advice and organize necessary maintenance for the properties. We
managed over 330,005 dwellings in France as of December 31, 2020, where we
provided recurring services for these landlords under contracts that are typically one
year in length. We also offer occupancy guarantee services to certain owner-lessors
to provide guaranteed rental income should their lessees fail to make their rental
payments or occupy the premise. See “—Lease Management and Renting” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of


-----

_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Rent payment and_
_occupancy guarantees.” Our Lease Management and Renting_ business generated
€283.6 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Through our
growth strategy, which includes both acquisitions and organic growth initiatives, we
have increased the number of dwellings we manage in France from 311,888 for the
year ended December 31, 2018 to 330,005 in France as of December 31, 2020.

    - Real estate brokerage (our “Brokerage business”): In addition to the recurring activity in our
Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses, we support our
existing customers or other customers with their purchase or sale plans, by offering property
search services, estimations on rental income, advice and assistance with banking and
administrative formalities and market analysis, buyer solvency assessments and other services.
Once a landlord mandates us to sell their apartment, this mandate covers the entire business
process from buyer identification to cash collection. We closed over 13,763 transactions in
the year ended December 31, 2020 and our Brokerage business generated €125.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020.

    - Our other services include:

        - _B2B Services: Esset, our B2B business, comprises all lines of business with_
commercial and institutional customers. Our Esset business line includes Esset
Management, our wealth management and consulting services for commercial and
office properties firm, and Foncia Valorisation, which markets properties by blocks
or lots. Our experience and expertise within multiple facets of the real estate services
market allows us to provide a broad range of service offerings, including residential,
commercial and corporate services, to these B2B customers. For example, we may
provide services to an insurance institution, a B2B customer, that owns and rents
residential apartments, commercial space and corporate office space and we are able
to service their needs in each of these capacities. Our B2B business generated €34.5
million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, we acquired
Yxime and Perial to strengthen this B2B business.

        - _Digital Services: Our Digital Services business includes our businesses that rely on a_
digital platform and is comprised of Efficity, Lodgis and Leemo. Efficity is an online
real estate valuation and brokerage activity operated with a business model based on
independent sales agents. Lodgis is a real estate agency specialized in renting and
selling furnished units and Leemo is a digital platform selling newly built properties.
Our Digital Services business generated €42.8 million in revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

        - _Additional Ancillary Services: We have developed a strong and diversified portfolio_
of other brands and businesses that offer services that are complementary to our
RRES and Brokerage businesses in order to enhance the value we provide to
customers on our platform. These additional complementary services primarily
include our specialized property insurance brokerage unit (Assurimo), our technical
due diligence and inventories services unit (Constatimmo), our business-specific IT
services (Seiitra), marketing of properties by blocks or lots (Foncia Valorisation) and
technical homeowner maintenance solutions which we launched in France in 2019
(Techway). Our complementary services businesses generated €53.3 million in
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

We also offer RRES, Brokerage and other services in our international businesses in Switzerland, Germany and
Belgium. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 87% of our revenues were derived in France, and 7%, 5%,
and 2% of our revenues were derived in Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, respectively. For a further
detailed description of our businesses, see “—Our Businesses.”

We were founded in 1972 and have since established ourselves as the leading European RRES, with over 10,000
employees across Europe as of December 31, 2020. Our recent growth has been marked by achievements in
operations, digitization, our successful M&A track record and our IT and communications infrastructure. We
believe our success is the result of a unique integrated ecosystem of real estate services providing the
opportunity for cross-selling of recurring and additional services and growth through bolt-on acquisitions. The


-----

following diagram provides a breakdown of our revenue by business for the for the year ended December 31,
2020:

(1) Lease Management and Renting revenues also include revenue generated from interest income on our customer accounts, Foncia

Immo Neuf and Holiday Rental.

(2) Ancillary Services revenues include intercompany sales.

The RRES market in the jurisdictions in which we operate remains largely fragmented. According to a
third-party report prepared in 2019 the French property management market was estimated to be worth
approximately €12 billion (excluding rental services and brokerage), of which approximately €5.3 billion was
under external management, along with an estimated €1.2 billion market for rental services. However, greater
regulation in France and the increasing need to invest in the digitization of services has made it more difficult
and time consuming for private landlords to keep property management in-house, leading to the increased
outsourcing and penetration rate of properties under external management in the residential property
management market. These trends towards increased regulation and digitization have also led to the growing
consolidation of the highly fragmented market, enabling us to capitalize on small bolt-on, strategic acquisitions
and increase our market positioning and scale. Our size provides us with a competitive advantage against
smaller and local competitors as we can industrialize processes to better leverage our cost base, replicate best
practices across our network to ensure consistent quality of service and adapt more easily to regulatory changes.
As a result, we made 61 acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2020, both in our primary French market
and in other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management dwellings and
approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings and approximately €111.0 million of
acquired revenues. We have a robust acquisition pipeline in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and
Luxembourg and a strong team of approximately 28 employees and 10 trainees dedicated to post acquisition
integration.

**Our Strengths**

**_Sector leadership focused on strongest economies in Western Europe providing competitive advantages_**

We have established ourselves as a leader for residential real estate services in France, Switzerland, Germany,
Belgium and Luxembourg by delivering high quality, reliable and innovative services uniquely suited to the
needs of our customers. As of August 2019, we were the number one player in the French real estate services
market, with approximately 13% market share, according to an international report provider. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, we managed approximately 1.8 million dwellings in France, which is approximately two
times the number of dwellings managed by our next closest competitor according to publically available
information for the year ended 2020. Outside of France, we hold leading positions in Switzerland and Germany
and have a strong presence in Belgium and Luxembourg. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we operated


-----

over 100 branches in these countries, which collectively accounted for 13% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

Our scale, operations and service offerings provide us with a clear competitive advantage. Our centralized
processes result in lower internal costs and enable improved customer service compared to our typically small,
individual-owned competitors. Our comprehensive range of innovative services, such as FONCIA 24/7 (our
assistance service for our joint property management customers), Prowen (our centralized energy service that
reduces client costs on gas and electricity), and Assurimo, (our real estate insurance service), differentiate us
from competitors. Our comprehensive network of over 500 branches covering all major French cities is one of
the largest offerings in the market and results in close proximity to our customers and the dwellings that we
manage; unique market positioning in negotiations with third-party repair and maintenance service suppliers
resulting in decreased costs; and financial resources that allow us to expand our customer portfolio through
acquisitions. We have been able to successfully enter markets through acquisitions and expanded our operating
geography, despite the regulatory and technological requirements that create barriers to participation in the real
estate services market. Our regional and national regulatory and real estate industry expertise and our leadership
team’s extensive experience in the real estate services industry are key to meeting and complying with such
requirements. Our strong reputation for quality and service and multi-branded strategy have also supported our
ability to grow in existing markets and enter new markets.

**_Loyal and diverse customer base and synergetic business model in a resilient market_**

Our large and diversified client base, integrated ecosystem of residential real estate services and high customer
retention rates drive a high level of recurring revenues (75% in the year ended December 31, 2020).

We have grown our diversified customer base to approximately 1.5 million dwellings in our French Joint
Property Management business and over 330,000 dwellings in our French Lease Management business as at
December 31, 2020. Through our synergetic business model, we are able to cross sell our services to our
diverse customer portfolio across our business lines, which in turn leads to further organic growth. For
example, our proven ability to cross-sell is highlighted by the high penetration rates of Assurimo, our
specialized property insurance brokerage unit (providing property insurance, homeowners’ insurance policies
and brokerage services) through which we currently provide insurance services to 61% of our French Joint
Property Management buildings. Similarly, we currently provide technical services to approximately 88% of
our Lease Management customers through our dedicated business, Constatimmo. We believe that we are well
positioned to target new customers, including B2B customers, given our knowledge regarding fulfilling
requirements for our B2C customers.

The addressable markets in which we operate are characterized by high outsourcing rates, with a high and stable
portion of joint property or condominium owners (85% in France) under external management, as of August
2019 using services like our Joint Property Management business. Property owners tend to rely on expert
services such as ours due to the volume of work and amount of legal and accounting know-how required to
directly interface with tenants and other counterparties. Moreover, landlords rarely switch leasing managers
during a tenancy, given the risks and costs involved in switching service providers and the limited potential
benefit. We believe that through the integrated ecosystem of high-quality services we consistently provide we
have established high customer retention rates, and long lasting customer relationships, certain of which last
more than 20 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we lost only 3.5% and 8.4% of customers from our
Joint Property Management and Lease Management businesses, respectively. Moreover, 36% of our customers
from our Joint Property Management business in France entered into contracts of three or more years and 24%
for two to three years for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to our broad and diverse customer base, we
are not reliant on any particular customer.

According to an international report provider, the French property management market is estimated to be €12.2
billion in August 2019, of which €5.3 billion is captured by property management companies, with the rest
serviced in-house. The externally serviced property management market has grown by approximately 2%
annually between 2015 and 2019. This stable growth has been driven by population dynamics and the
construction of collective units. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow through acquisition of
customer portfolios, cross-selling of related services to our large client base and the addition of new revenue
opportunities for our existing services.


-----

**_Strong and predictable cash flow generation_**

We have a track record of steady cash flow generation, driven by a high level of recurring revenues, which has
enabled us to establish a history of consistent deleveraging. Our trend of improving EBITDA conversion rates
has continued with a Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate, of approximately 76% for the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared to 71% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Despite our regular M&A
activity, our discretionary spend on acquisitions provides us with flexibility to manage our cash flow and reduce
our financial leverage. Further, our business requires limited maintenance capital expenditures, (accounting for
approximately 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020), and is characterized by limited working
capital requirements.

Our revenue increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 up
from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our margin resilience is supported by an adaptable
cost structure for the more cyclical flow Brokerage business, as Brokerage salary costs include a significant
variable portion that is indexed on commissions. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 26.9%, 26.8% and 22.3%
for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Our recurring, stable revenue is in part due to our complementary business profiles across our branches,
experienced management and sales force teams, and fee-based services in connection with our Joint Property
Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses which accounted for 69% of our revenue in France
for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, our high proportion of recurring revenues (75% in 2020)
and balanced portfolio of services split between stock and flow businesses with limited correlation have
supported our resilience during adverse economic conditions, achieving a substantially stable performance in
2020 despite unprecedented government measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Continuous investments in operational improvement through our innovative technology platforms reinforces_**
**_our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains_**

We continuously invest in cutting edge technology in order to offer the best multi-channel services to our
customers. Since 2017, we have upgraded a significant portion of our IT and communication infrastructure
including utilizing a mix of integrated and outsourced solutions, transitioning to a single telecom provider, and
streamlining our finance and human resources functions with Workday, which enabled us to quickly and
effectively transition to a work-from-home environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also
leveraged our technological know-how combined with our knowledge of the real estate industry to design and
launch a go-live version of our new ERP system, Millenium, which we have piloted at one of our branches in
France in 2020. Millenium integrates all of our IT and resource planning functions into one database to better
meet our customers’ needs and address internal business challenges. Millenium increases the digitization of our
activities with the aim of helping customers by creating greater transparency and improving our operations with
standardized, digital processes to increase efficiency and to improve the speed at which we can serve our
customers. We believe our high levels of investment in IT for our corporate platform and customer interface
service such as over recent years give us a competitive edge in the current environment.

The digitization, standardization and automation offered by Millenium complement our already synergetic
business model and will allow us to more quickly leverage our customer database to identify cross-selling
opportunities leading to greater operating efficiencies and inter-business synergies. We believe that
Millenium’s compatibility with big data, AI and IoT, will allow us to explore new business opportunities and
provide access to a number of revenue-enhancing opportunities. For example, we are developing a new
operational model called “Agency of the Future” which will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real
estate services and aims at improving client satisfaction and reducing our customer churn rate, which we believe
will, in turn, lead to greater opportunities for organic growth. In addition, we believe that the gains of
Millenium and the development of Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in
2022. We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technology to continually improve our internal
operations in order to provide our customers with product offerings that meet their needs and make us the
number one choice among residential real estate service providers.

**_Consolidation platform with proven track record of executing value accretive acquisitions to drive_**
**_incremental EBITDA growth_**

In addition to our organic growth, we maintain a successful, low-risk strategy of growth through small, bolt-on
acquisitions. We completed 220 acquisitions from January 2016 to December 2020, which represented
approximately €386.0 million of acquired revenues (including gross revenues for Leemo netted for commissions


-----

to agents in our financial accounts). In the year ended December 31, 2020, we made 61 acquisitions in our
primary French market and in other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management
dwellings and approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings and approximately €111.0
million of acquired revenues. We completed 61 acquisitions which contributed to our Adjusted EBITDA that
reached €286.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €258.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Consolidation is a natural trend in the highly fragmented markets we operate in,
accelerated by increasing regulations, and we play a key role in the market by defining new quality standards
and unrivalled execution processes. We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is dedicated
to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our five geographical
regions. Our long-standing integration experience, including a dedicated post-acquisition integration team,
enables us to extract full synergy potential from acquired businesses, with both cross-selling and cost synergies.
We have identified a number of potential targets in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg to
continue growing and, importantly, reinforcing our leadership in the market.

**_Highly experienced management team with proven execution capabilities and focus on growth and value_**
**_creation_**

Our management team, led by our Chief Executive Officer, Philippe Salle, have significant experience in the
industry and proven track record of delivering business and revenue growth, executing investment plans, driving
continuous improvement of our European enterprise and generating high returns on capital. Our management
team comes from various industries and geographies and is supported by five heads of region, who have
extensive experience in real estate and enable us to provide our customers with tailored expertise and service.

We believe that the collective industry knowledge and leadership of our management team positions them well
to continue our successful organic and external growth and execute our strategies. Further, our management
team encourages growth through a focus on operational efficiency and innovation including through the
management’s dynamic external growth policy that enabled us to, among others, establish our market leading
presence in Germany, successfully divest our non-core businesses to focus on our core, synergetic businesses
and more recently, by the ongoing overhaul of our IT infrastructure, including the development of Millenium
and enabling our planned transition to our new operational model, “Agency of the Future.” This is
demonstrated by the consistent increase in our revenues which increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (€1,013 million excluding the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic) up from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Our Strategies**

**_Industry-leading technology to further reinforce our competitive advantage_**

We are committed to providing the best real estate services offerings to our customers by investing in industryleading IT and data platforms, which in turn supports our market share gains. Our most recent digital
innovation, Millenium, an in-house developed ERP system that is device-agnostic, cloud-based and driven by
artificial intelligence, will allow us to fully digitalize all of our businesses and establish a highly personalized
digital relationship with our customers. We believe that Millenium will also allow us to better, more efficiently
serve our customers, cross-sell across our platforms and therefore capture greater market share from existing
customers and generate business from new customers.

Our IT and data platforms are subject to a process of continuous improvement and innovation, which we support
with ongoing investments, such as the team of over 80 developers and specialized professional we hired to
create Millenium. We believe that our robust investments in our IT and data platforms provide us with a
significant competitive advantage, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses have been
required to transition to a work-from-home environment. Additionally, our ongoing and historical use of big
data, AI and IoT to create new business opportunities enables us to maintain a cutting edge development
program while minimizing the risks traditionally associated with experimentation. For example, we are in the
process of developing our new operational model, Agency of the Future, which we believe will generate
significant gains, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and
back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time
spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain
tasks that were previously done manually, such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges. Since 2018,
we have invested approximately €100 million into our IT projects, and we believe that the gains of Millenium
and Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in 2022.


-----

We have developed, and continue to develop, innovative solutions based on emerging trends that are aimed at
providing our customers with the highest quality, optimal solutions for their real estate needs. We are constantly
looking for ways to improve our offerings and develop new solutions for our customers, which we expect to
drive incremental growth and positively impact our revenue.

**_Continue to drive organic growth and pursue targeted and opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions in core French_**
**_market_**

Our goal is to continue to deliver organic growth in France. We have been successful in achieving incremental
organic revenue growth through active cross selling efforts across our ancillary services. We intend to continue
to benefit from this growth through expanding our service offerings by introducing new business lines. In
addition, we aim to reduce our customer churn rate further by improving client satisfaction, including as a result
of the overhaul of our IT systems.

In addition, we have made, and intend to continue to make, bolt-on acquisitions in our core French market and
the other geographies in which we operate to supplement our organic growth, solidify our current market
position and expand our presence. We have a strong track record of successfully identifying, completing and
integrating opportunistic acquisitions. From January 2016 to December 2020, we completed approximately 220
acquisitions. We believe that our strong brand, broad platform and our dynamic infrastructure have allowed us
to generate growth and operating cash flows through acquisitions. Recent examples of targeted acquisitions in
France that have accelerated our growth and have allowed us to better address customer needs include Gérance
de Passy and LoftOne, in our RRES business, Yxime and Perial in B2B and in the German B2B segment, Paul
Immobilien and SogerTec. We intend to continue to further strengthen our strong position in the market by
pursuing opportunistic acquisitions in our existing geographies to accelerate our growth, and we aim to do so by
leveraging our internal expertise.

We have an M&A team that is dedicated to identifying growth opportunities. Our team deploys a disciplined
and systematic approach and focuses on opportunities that will enhance the offerings and services we provide in
France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg.

**_Continue to grow internationally_**

We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our geographic footprint in Europe, organically and through
targeted and opportunistic acquisitions. We intend to leverage our expertise and know-how as well as our
highly localized real estate providers to penetrate European markets where there is an unmet demand and an
opportunity for further expansion, as evidenced by factors such as population dynamics and the construction of
collective units, accompanied by increases in price and service level and a higher degree of outsourcing driven
by regulatory changes. We strategically pursue new markets while remaining committed to expanding in
France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg as these markets offer us proximity to existing
customers and expansion opportunities in countries where we have established brand recognition. We also plan
to enter European markets, where we believe local markets have strong fundamentals, such as the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Scandinavian countries, Austria and various other Eastern European
countries where we aim to become the market leader. Our expertise and solutions are scalable from region to
region, and we believe that as we continue to expand, we can increase market share by deploying practices and
strategies that have proven to be successful in other markets.

**_Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Leadership_**

We are committed to ESG matters and providing a safe and healthy environment for all of our customers and
employees. Our corporate social responsibility strategy is based on the following key commitments: supporting
sustainable energy in the buildings and dwellings we manage, improving the well-being of our customers and
our employees and ensuring fair and non-discriminatory access to housing and assisting local communities. Our
ESG initiatives are also focused on protecting the environment while also ensuring that our operations have
minimal impact on the environment.

We also aim to work with our clients, contractors and suppliers to improve efficiency, conserve natural
resources and reduce waste and emissions. We focus on energy transition of buildings under management by
developing services and solutions to enable our clients to renovate and finance their dwellings. In 2021, we aim
to ensure that all of our building managers are systematically trained to lead such renovation projects, partner
with clients and employees who demonstrate a commitment to the environment and reduce our carbon footprint.

**History of the Group**

We were incorporated in 1972 and have since expanded our business with subsequent acquisitions of real estate
services businesses in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and we are focused on
improving our technological capabilities in order to optimize our efficiency and overall business offering. From
January 2016 to December 2020, we have completed approximately 220 acquisitions, primarily within Joint
Property Management and Lease Management and Renting. Our external growth strategy and development of
ancillary service offerings has been a key driver to our historical growth. The following are the key milestones

**Our Businesses**

We are the European leader in the RRES market, serving customers in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium
and Luxembourg. We maintain an integrated business model with operations across a wide range of businesses,
with recognized brand names in the countries in which we operate. Our unique business model provides for
cross-selling opportunities, which help us achieve recurring and predictable revenues and strong cash flows.

**_Residential Real Estate Services (France)_**

The residential real estate services in France, operating primarily under the Foncia brand, represented 60% of
our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 61% of our total revenue generated in France for


-----

the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue from this business primarily comprises (i) jointly owned property
management fees, (ii) rental management fees (including rent payment and occupancy guarantee fees), and (iii)
letting fees, which allow us to maintain stable revenues.

_Management of Jointly Owned Properties_

In our Joint Property Management business, we assist our customers in managing common building areas,
features and costs in their jointly owned properties by providing technical and accounting management. These
management services include (i) providing information and communicating on a regular basis with the joint
property owners, (ii) organizing and managing general meetings of joint property owners by preparing the
agenda, summons, minutes, etc., (iii) managing the upkeep of the joint property as a whole, (iv) controlling costs
by drawing up a budget, (v) obtaining bids from potential suppliers, (vi) providing a breakdown of joint property
charges, (vii) collecting funds and amounts due for the joint property accounts, (viii) providing bookkeeping
services, (ix) monitoring contract performance, and (x) providing mass procurement offers for joint property
owners and leveraging our large purchasing power to offer attractive prices to our customers on expenses such
as gas and other utilities. We also provide direct access to all Foncia services on a unique customer portal,
MyFoncia, and offer around-the-clock customer service.

From a contractual and legal perspective, our Joint Property Management business is conducted primarily
through mandates. We take the role of trustee (syndic) after appointment by the homeowners’ board or general
assembly of joint owners. We calculate fees on a flat-rate basis, which leads to relatively stable and recurring
revenue. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property
association, including (i) preparing, convening and organizing general meetings, (ii) managing the joint owners’
council or general assembly (iii) managing the financial operations, including bill payments and collection of
building fees, (iv) keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association (v) managing the jointly
owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations and (vi) carrying out periodic visits and inspections
of the jointly owned property. We also receive additional incidental fees such as transfer fees when a landlord
selling a dwelling requires a book balance report called a “transfer report,” reminder fees, fees on
insurance-related claim management services, maintenance and repair commissions on third parties invoices and
additional post office charges. These variable fees comprise 23% of our total Joint Property Management fees
for the year ended December 31, 2020.

All such services are treated as an overall performance. These different services are associated with a single
performance obligation, i.e., the management of the jointly owned property association. Incidental services may
be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service.

As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,463,402 dwellings under our management of jointly owned properties,
generating a revenue of €290.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 30% of our total
revenue for the same period.

_Lease Management and Renting_

Our Lease Management and Renting business is comprised of Lease Management and rental services.

On the Lease Management side of the business, we manage an owner’s-lessor’s rented apartment and provide
assistance on the day-to-day operations of the property, typically related to financial management, legal
assistance and handling conflicts. We are appointed by the owner of the individual unit, typically a private
landlord, and we act as agent for owners-lessors to fulfil a number of contractually defined obligations in this
regard. These key services primarily include: (i) routine management services such as rent reviews and
collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, and sending rent receipts and deposits to lessees, (ii) other
one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of
documentation, management of claims, administrative filings and requests for subsidies, (iii) technical
management services, such as coordinating on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys and preparation of
essential information documents for lessees, (iv) insurance against unpaid rent and (v) other insurance such as
for vacant premises or property damage.

Lease Management fees are comprised of a base fee for the contracted services described above and, in some
instances, other additional fees such as fees in connection with helping file tax forms or fees related to rent
payment guarantees. We offer rent payment guarantees (“Garantie de loyers impayés” or “rent payment
guarantee”) to certain residential landlords in France for whom we provide property management services and
an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation” or “occupancy guarantee”) to a small number of lessors to


-----

protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant for selected apartments in
new dwellings. In December 2020, approximately 66% of residential dwellings in France were covered by the
rent payment guarantee, and approximately 12% of rentals are covered by the occupancy guarantee. We believe
we have a strong ability to assess credit risk when offering these guarantees and undertake a detailed process to
select eligible tenants and dwellings. We refer to the new unpaid rents as a result of defaults under the
occupancy guarantee each month as “flow of unpaid rent,” and the total sum of unpaid rents per month as our
“stock of unpaid rent.”

In December 2020, €124.7 million of rent revenues were covered by the rent payment guarantee, for which we
experienced €3.5 million unpaid rent (for a 2020 average new monthly aggregate of unpaid rent of €3.3 million)
and the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent was €27.7 million, including outstanding rent payments from
previous years. Once rent is reported as unpaid, any payments to landlords under these guarantees are recorded
in full as a provision on our balance sheet. By underwriting rent payment guarantees and occupancy guarantees
on our own balance sheet, we believe we offer a differentiating and competitive service to customers that
smaller competitors would not be able to deliver. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Rent payment and_
_occupancy guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Low demand for_
_housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income_
_produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_
_condition or results of operations.”_

As of December 31, 2020, we had 330,005 dwellings under management in our Lease Management and Renting
business, generating a revenue of €283.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 30% of
our total revenue for the same period (this includes Foncia Immo Neuf, CAI and Holiday Rental). Revenues are
driven by rent evolution, fees as a percent of rent (on units acquired), and add-on services and volumes are
driven by apartments under lease management and tenant mobility rates. We operate primarily in the residential
real estate services market, but manage certain commercial real estate properties through Esset. See “—Other
_Services (France).”_

Through our renting services, we aim to minimize the vacancy rates of the properties by helping landlords find a
suitable tenant and helping tenants find a property to rent. For landlords, we manage the sourcing, screening,
and contracting of new tenants, and provide services such as posting advertisements on various real estate
portals, showcasing their properties in Foncia branches and providing structured feedback on renting efforts.
For tenants, we assist lessees with leasing rental properties and we receive one-off placement fees for these
services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we assisted with 59,288 rentals. Our services include access
to a large number of rental home insurance packages and fixture inventory programs offered by professionals
who are available on short notice.

**_Brokerage (France)_**

We completed over 13,763 transactions across France in the year ended December 31, 2020 and support our
customers with all aspects of their property sales or purchases. Once we receive a mandate, we follow the sale
through to completion. Our services include property viewings and search services, advice and assistance with
banking and administrative formalities, property appraisals, buyer solvency assessments, market analysis,
assistance complying with regulatory requirements, and drafting sale agreements. Our Brokerage business is
conducted primarily through mandates, exclusive or shared, and fees for such mandate in the event of a
transaction are calculated on a flat-rate basis. This rate usually comprises an average of 5.18% of the selling
price of the property. Revenue are recognized upon signature of the notarized final sale agreement (acte
_authentique). For further discussion on notary execution, see “Regulation.”_

Our Brokerage business provides ample opportunities for cross-selling services, such as property appraisals,
brokerage insurance, technical surveys, and inventories services provided by our other businesses. See “—Other
_Services (France).” Our Brokerage business in France generated a revenue of €125.0 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2020, representing 13% of our total revenue for the same period.

**_Other Services (France)_**

Our other services are comprised of B2B businesses, Digital businesses, and our other businesses that provide
ancillary services to our offerings with high penetration rates within our network. For example, Assurimo has a
61% penetration rate with our Joint Property Management buildings from providing property insurance,
homeowners’ insurance policies and brokerage services. Assurimo connects our customers with insurance

Our other ancillary services, Digital businesses and B2B businesses generated revenues of €53.3 million, €42.8
million and €34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.

**_International_**

Since 2003, we have expanded our services outside of France and in the year ended December 31, 2020, we
generated 13% of our revenue in our international operations. We have acquired recognizable brands in
Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and have reached leading positions in these markets for our
real estate services. Our average international headcount for employees in 2020 increased to 1,430, compared to
983 and 835 employees in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Switzerland Germany Belgium

_Switzerland_

We entered the Swiss market in 2004 through the acquisition of the real estate services group, GECO. In 2015,
we reinforced our position in the French-speaking region of Switzerland with the acquisition of Domicim, and
we entered the German-speaking regions of Switzerland in 2019 through the acquisition of Gribi. As of
December 31, 2020, we have 32 branches in Switzerland and all of our operations were managed under DBS
Group which includes ten recognizable brands Domicim, Brolliet, Duc-Sarrasin, Elitim, Batiline, Facilitim,
Immosure, Gribi, GUINNARD and Bruchez & Gaillard. While we offer all of our primary services in
Switzerland, our Brokerage business is characterized by transactions on whole buildings (sales in blocs), rather
than individual units. We are also involved in sales of new buildings for promoters.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our operations in Switzerland generated €67.3 million in revenue.

_Germany_

We entered the German market in 2003 through the acquisition of FONCIA VOW Verwaltungsorganisation für
die Wohnungswirtschaft GmbH & Co.KG. Our dynamic external growth policy enabled us to establish our
presence in Germany, and our latest acquisitions include Vegis and Prazisa in June and July 2019, Sogertec in
October 2020 and Paul Immobilien in September 2020. We operate under the Foncia Deutschland brand, with a
presence in 57 branches and we are recognized as a leader in Joint Property Management in a highly fragmented
market composed of relatively small local players.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our operations in Germany generated €44.0 million in revenue.

_Belgium_

We entered the Belgium market under the Trevi brand, which we acquired in May 2013 through a reverse
takeover that enabled us to retain a successful local management team. We have 12 branches in Belgium, which
are primarily located in the greater Brussels area, as well as in Flanders. We believe we are one of the largest
residential real estate services group in Belgium and now operate under the OP Brand. In December 2020, we
acquired OP to strengthen our service offerings in Belgium. The acquisition of OP will allow us to enter the
Luxembourg market through its branches in the country.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our operations in Belgium generated €14.8 million in revenue.

**Digital Transformation and IT Systems**

Digital transformation is at the heart of our operations and we believe it will improve the efficiency of our
operations and commercial development, while providing unique and differentiated services to customers. From


-----

inception, we have appreciated the importance of creating an efficient platform in order to better serve our
customers, and understand the dynamics of our market and improve our employees responsiveness and
efficiency. IT systems impact virtually all aspects of our business, including record keeping, customer
information processing and storage, data security, marketing and sales, compliance logistics, and practice and
performance management. Our IT strategy is driven by the dual goals of promoting growth of our business
while ensuring data security.

Our most recent digital innovation is Millenium, our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system that we
developed in-house, and we launched a go-live version of it in March 2020 at one of our branches in France.
We have invested significant resources in Millenium, including a team of 80 developers and specialized
professionals in order to build this innovative and advanced real estate platform, and we aim to roll it out across
our branches in France in 2022.

Millenium includes numerous functionalities and unifies a number of our IT functions at our head office under
one centralized database. It is managed by an experienced team of information specialists. Business
applications for each of our activities have been developed with Millenium, including our Joint Property
Management business, Lease Management and Renting business, and Brokerage Business, as well as our
accounting department, support call center and web and mobile applications. Millenium is equipped with an
application interface program, which is a technology that allows for a direct access to other software solutions,
startups, and business partners. For example, Millenium is connected to Kyriba, an online platform for viewing
bank transaction in real time, which we use to manage our Joint Property Management cash transactions
involving approximately 116,000 bank accounts. Millenium also functions with Docapost, an online,
information technology company, which we utilize to collect and scan checks, and send and receive
approximately 8.8 million letters and invoices per year.

Millenium will provide, among other features, (i) increased digitization of activities, including the ability to use
online signatures and receive digital payments, (ii) greater transparency with our customers, as employee
progress on customer matters can be seen in real time and customer calls are tracked using tickets, (iii)
significant automation of the accounting activities, (iv) the ability to better leverage our customer database to
create inter-business synergies in compliance with European GDPR regulations, and (v) standardized processes
across our businesses and substantial efficiencies due to a high degree of automation. Millenium also includes
MyFoncia, a web and mobile app platform designed to improve customer experience through automation,
digitization, and improved productivity for our customers to use for all of their service needs.

In parallel to the deployment of Millenium, we are in the process of designing a new operational model called
Agency of the Future which will be implemented following the roll-out of Millenium in France in 2022.
Agency of the Future will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real estate services and aims to improve
client satisfaction, reducing our customer churn rate and, in turn, leading to greater opportunities for organic
growth. See “Summary—Our Strengths—Continuous investments in operational improvement through our
_innovative technology platforms reinforces our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains.”_

In the coming years, we plan to fully digitalize all business lines, internal processes, and our customer
relationship management. In addition, we aim to increase our use of big data, artificial intelligence and IoT and
continue to further automate our accounting. We believe that the improved standardization and digitization
Millenium offers, will allow us to reduce administrative inefficiencies and achieve greater productivity. In
addition, we believe that Millenium will enable us to achieve greater organization among our businesses
allowing our employees to focus on customer satisfaction with the potential to lead to improved customer
retention. It may also lead to new business opportunities, which could include big data or machine learning and
licensing opportunities.

**Corporate Social Responsibility**

We service the homes of more than 4.7 million people in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and, more
recently, Luxembourg. As a key local player, we are committed to sustainable housing improved well-being,
and better living for our customers, tenants, residents, communities, and other stakeholders in the residential real
estate sector. We achieve this through our corporate social responsibility strategy, which is based on three key
commitments: supporting sustainable energy in the buildings and dwellings we manage, improving the wellbeing of our customers in ensuring fair and non-discriminatory access to housing and assisting local
communities.


-----

From this mission stems the responsibility to provide solutions to environmental and social issues in our sector,
and to contribute to more sustainable lifestyles. We have developed a number of ESG initiatives that measure
and aim to improve on annual basis. For example, track our carbon footprint and aim to reduce it each year.
We also closely consider the impact that our clients, contractors and suppliers have on the environment and we
aim to work with those who seek to improve efficiency, conserve natural resources and reduce waste and
emissions. In addition, we focus on energy transition of buildings under management by developing services
and solutions to enable our clients to renovate and finance their dwellings. In 2021, one of our goals related to
corporate social responsibility is to ensure that all of our building managers are systematically trained to lead
such renovation projects and partner with clients and employees who demonstrate a commitment to the
environment.

**_Sustainable Real Estate_**

The real estate sector is responsible for approximately 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in France and plays a
decisive role in the fight against climate change. The environmental impact of a building is influenced by three
factors, including: (i) the performance of the building itself; (ii) the management and the maintenance of its
equipment; and (iii) occupant behaviors. Our objective is to improve our impact on the environment and our
commitment is driven by these three factors. We are focused on promoting energy renovation, developing more
sustainable building management by measuring the energy consumption of our park and setting targets to
improve future performance, raising awareness, and supporting our customers in making better use of resources.

**_Our Commitments to Local Communities_**

We have over 134 and 131 branches dedicated to our RRES and Brokerage businesses, respectively, and 242
branches dedicated to both businesses throughout France and over 101 branches in Switzerland, Germany, and
Belgium and, by the nature of our activity, we aim to contribute to the economic development of the
communities in which we operate. We wish to assume and reaffirm our role as a partner and supporter of our
customers and other stakeholders at the local and national levels, and aim to accomplish this through a number
of measures. For example, by strengthening and enhancing our territorial anchoring, focusing on our
recruitment efforts, concentrating on our choice of and support from our suppliers and reinforcing our
commitment as a good corporate citizen. We also seek to develop a dialogue with our stakeholders and improve
our communication on topics of interest to our stakeholders.

**Well-being of our Customers and Employees**

We are aware of the rapid changes in lifestyles and ways of living in Europe, and we aim to actively contribute
to the improvement of the quality of life of our customers and our employees. This involves securing not only a
healthy living and working environment, but also a better understanding of the societal transformations at work
including developments in the digital space, new uses, and the development of associated responses. Finally,
we believe a commitment to quality of life also implies implementing concrete actions against discrimination,
particularly in terms of access to housing and the fight against absentee landlords.

**_Customers_**

The majority of our business lines have low customer concentration. Our Lease Management and Renting, and
Brokerage businesses are focused almost exclusively on serving individual customers. Our Joint Property
Management business is focused on serving condominium corporations, which are primarily individual entities,
rather than on B2B master agreements with institutional property customers. Of our businesses, Esset has the
highest customer concentration. Esset’s largest customer represented 9% of its total revenues for the year ended
December 30, 2020.

**_Employees_**

In 2020, we employed approximately 9,145 full time employees in our operations in France and approximately
1,430 full time employees outside of France. Despite the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
we added 884 full-time, permanent employees to our headcount in 2020. The majority of our employees work
full-time employees; however, we have increasingly relied on temporary employees, including hourly, parttime, and temporary workers, to better adapt to the seasonality of our business.


-----

The following table shows the average number of employees as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

**Year Ended December 31,** **2020** **2019** **2018**
Average headcount – France ............................................................ 9,145 8,708 8,181
Average headcount – International ................................................... 1,430 983 835

We believe our people are fundamental to our continued success, as their skills and dedication enable us to grow
and lead the market. We invest, and will continue to invest, in the development of our employees. For example,
we provide training on company policies such as data protection and privacy, health and safety, antidiscrimination, ethics, sustainability and anti-bribery, among others. In addition, we believe the implementation
of Millenium will result in productivity and efficiency gains, such as the automation of processes and controls,
that will lead to streamlined procedures and settings for our front office and administrative staff.

We cooperate with local unions, employee representatives, health, safety and working conditions committee and
work councils in France where these representative bodies are active. In these jurisdictions, we normally have
framework agreements or other general agreements in place, which are agreed through discussions with the
works councils and compliant with local labor laws. These agreements govern, among other things, working
conditions, working hours and the definition of tariff groups. These agreements can be negotiated for a limited
or unlimited term, and can be cancelled by either party in favor of renegotiation. These bodies have clearly
defined powers and we are required to consult and inform their members on a periodic basis about the
implementation of projects relating to the situation of our employees. We are also required to consult our work
council for the acquisition we are contemplating and for the integration of our acquired businesses. As we
typically complete multiple acquisitions every month, we have, therefore, agreed to meet with our work council
on a monthly basis to specifically discuss potential acquisitions and the integration of the recently completed
acquisitions.

We believe we have good relationships with our employees, and open and constructive working relationships
with such employee representation bodies across our various regions.

**Legal Proceedings**

We have been, and may from time to time be, a party to legal disputes and administrative proceedings within the
scope of our business activities. For example, we are currently involved in certain legal proceeding initiated
against us for alleged losses brought on behalf of lessees related to over charges for receiving notices to pay.
The court declared the association’s claim inadmissible. The claimant appealed the decision and this appeal is
scheduled for March 2021. We have not recorded a provision for this matter. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we are not involved in any material claims, lawsuits, investigations, or proceedings, and there are
no such material claims, lawsuits, investigations or proceedings threatened against us. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are subject to various litigation risks and may face financial_
_liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of litigation.”_

**Regulation**

The French rental market is highly regulated. We are not subject to a specific regulatory framework that
governs the operation of our business. However, our primary business offerings require that we comply with
regulations affecting the real estate industry and maintain licenses in the various jurisdictions in which we
operate and adhere to data protection standards. Like other market participants that operate in numerous
jurisdictions and in various businesses, we must comply with a myriad of regulatory regimes. Some of the most
significant regulations to which we are subject to include the European GDPR, the ALUR law, the ELAN the
PINEL plan and the Hoguet law. For information about these regulations and their impact on our business,
please see “Regulation.”

**Property**

_France_

Our Paris offices serve as our group headquarters. They house our core group-wide and French operational,
management and planning functions. We do not own any real estate and all of our properties are leased
pursuant to leases on customary terms.

In France, we had approximately 806 property leases, of which more than 30% are tacitly renewed, including
our 134 and 131 branches dedicated to our RRES and Brokerage businesses and our 242 branches dedicated to


-----

both businesses, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020. These contracts are managed using a
dynamic approach directly in line with the operating performance of our branch network and real estate strategy.
As at December 31, 2020, our key leases in France include the head office at Antony, Rue de Provence, Rue
Raymond Losserand and Boulevard de Courcelles premises in Paris and the Esset Management’s premises at
Courbevoie.

_Switzerland, Germany and Belgium_

Our headquarters in Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium are located in Geneva, Berlin, and Brussels,
respectively. Each office is responsible for the operations in their respective countries, excluding a few
exceptions, such as M&A transactions. We do not own any real estate and all of our properties are leased
pursuant to leases on customary terms. In Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium, we had approximately 260
property leases. As at December 31, 2020, our key leases outside of France are the Brolliet premises in
Switzerland and the Vegis, Foncia Maiberger, and Foncia Deutschland premises in Germany. For a full
discussion of our leases and accounting treatment, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—_
_Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—IFRS-16.”_

**Competitive Landscape**

The real estate services market is highly fragmented, however, the industry has recently experienced a period of
active consolidation marked by an increase in M&A activity and the emergence of larger companies. We
compete for customers on the basis of customer service, service offerings, reputation, and the ability to tailor our
services to the specific needs of a customer, and we believe our size and our unique, nationwide network sets us
apart from our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We have
_numerous local, regional and national competitors across all of our businesses and the geographies that we_
_serve, and further industry consolidation, fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future_
_competition.” In France, our main competitors include Nexity, Citya, Square Habitat, and Credit Agricole_
Immobilier in the RRES market, BNP Paribas Real Estate and Nexity in the commercial property management
market and Orpi, Century21, Citya, Guy Hoquet, and Laforet in the Brokerage market. In Switzerland, our
largest competitors are Wincasa, Livit, and Privera, and in Belgium, we believe our largest competitor is Lamy
(Nexity). In Germany, the largest market participant is ECE, focusing on the retail segment, followed by
Strabag and Apleona with large commercial portfolios, and Capera, Treureal, and DIM on the residential side.
For a further description of our industry and the competitive landscape in which we operate, see “Industry.”

**Intellectual property**

We have registered several trademarks in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and at the
European Union Trademark Database. We regard our trademarks and other intellectual property as valuable
assets in the marketing of our services, in particular, our “Foncia” trademark and the rights associated with our
new Millenium ERP IP. However, as we operate distinct businesses and brands for our various service offerings
and across geographies, we consider all of these core brands to be an integral part of our business, and we take
appropriate action when necessary to protect them and, when necessary, enforce them. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our brands and our reputation are key assets of our company,_
_which will be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.”_

**Insurance**

We have a number of insurance policies in place, including in connection with professional and civil
responsibilities based on our role as a real estate services provider, premises damages, D&O, cyber, and ITrelated insurance. Some of our real estate servicing contracts require that we maintain certain levels of
insurance. We believe we have adequate insurance coverage against material risks that are typically insured by
similar companies with comparable risk exposure. Insurance coverage is regularly verified and adjusted when
necessary; however, our insurance may not cover every potential risk associated with our business. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient.”_

**REGULATION**

_The following provides a brief description of the main laws and regulations applicable to our business._
_Although the following brief description contains selected information concerning laws and regulations that we_
_consider material, it is not an exhaustive account of all applicable laws and regulations. References and_
_discussions to laws, regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents are entirely qualified by the_
_full text thereof._

**General**

We are not subject to a specific regulatory framework that governs the operation of our business, although there
are a number of regulations we must comply with as we deliver our primary service offerings to our customers.
These regulations vary between one jurisdiction to another and also between our businesses. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our businesses, financial condition, results of_
_operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws_
_or regulations or the application thereof. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or_
_make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.”_

**European Laws and Regulations**

**_Data Protection_**

We acquire and process personal data on customers and customers during the course of our activities and our
databases contain personal data of customers and customers. Our ability to obtain, retain and process such
personal data is governed by data protection and privacy regulations and guidance issued by, among others, the
European Union, national regulators and, where applicable, recommendations and best practices developed by
trade associations.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)) became effective as of
May 25, 2018. The GDPR provides a common framework for data protection and privacy and regulates the
Processing and transfer of Personal Data in the European Union. In the course of our activities, we may be
qualified as “Controllers,” or as “Processor,” as defined and governed by GDPR, depending on the services
provided and the service agreement entered into.

We established our compliance program with GDPR quite early and we comply with the GDPR obligations, and
rights for individuals whose Personal Data we Process (“Data Subjects”), including, among others:

    - accountability and transparency obligations, requiring us to demonstrate and record
compliance with the GDPR, including the maintenance of detailed records of Personal Data
Processing activities;

    - appointment of a data protection officer, subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria;

    - requirements to Process Personal Data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, to Process
Personal Data only to the extent necessary for the purposes required, maintain the accuracy of
Personal Data, limit the retention of Personal Data for no longer than is necessary, and
maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures against unauthorized
Processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage to Personal Data;

    - an obligation to provide clear notice of Personal Data Processing activities to Data Subjects,
which must include, among other details: the identity of the Controller and the Processor; the
nature and purpose of the Processing activities; the legal basis applicable to each Processing
activity; the categories of Personal Data Processed, the recipients to whom the Personal Data
are disclosed; the rights of the Data Subjects; and details of any cross-border transfers of
Personal Data;

    - an obligation to include certain mandatory contractual terms in agreements with certain
service providers which Process Personal Data on our behalf;

    - restrictions on the export of Personal Data to recipients located in countries outside of the
European Economic Area;


-----

    - requirements to ensure, for each Processing activity, that either (i) there is a valid legal basis
in place; or (ii) an exemption or derogation applies;

    - obligations to consider data protection issues with respect to the development of any new
products or services which involve the Processing of Personal Data (“data protection by
design”), and to ensure that by default, the amount of Personal Data Processed is limited to
what is necessary in the context of the relevant Processing activity (“data protection by
default”);

    - a requirement to undertake a data protection impact assessment with respect to Processing
activities that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of relevant Data
Subjects;

    - obligations to comply with the data protection rights conferred on Data Subjects including, in
certain circumstances: a right of access to, and rectification of, Personal Data; a right to obtain
restriction of Processing; a right to object to Processing; a right to request that Personal Data
be transferred to another Controller; a right not to be subject to certain types of profiling or
automated decision-making; and a right to request erasing Personal Data; and

    - an obligation to notify Personal Data Breaches to Supervisory Authorities without undue delay
and no later than 72 hours after detection of the relevant Personal Data Breach, except where
the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of
individuals, and an obligation to notify affected Data Subjects without undue delay, unless the
Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the
affected Data Subjects.

The GDPR has therefore strengthened the individual rights of individuals over their personal data and imposes
strict requirements on companies processing personal data.

In addition, the GDPR introduces fines for serious breaches of up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide
revenue or €20 million. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the fine level to
impose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data Subjects also have a right to
compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress) in certain circumstances. Data Subjects may
bring complaints via the courts, or via Supervisory Authorities, or both, and in some circumstances may have a
choice as to the EU Member State(s) in which they bring such claims.

We accomplished a review of our data polices with the aim of minimizing data collection and storage so that
only the appropriate amount of personal data required for any particular purpose is processed, and establishing
protocols to destroy unnecessary datasets and anonymize data wherever possible. In addition, we have put in
place and implemented rules, policies and procedures that we strive to maintain and improve, in order to ensure
compliance with GDPR. These rules, policies and procedures are twofold: internal and external. These rules,
policies and procedures, implemented at all levels of our business, apply to the processing of personal data, data
storage, retention, preservation, maintenance, protection and management of personal data within the course of
our business operations, as well as the transfer of personal data. Our legal team was intensely involved in the
implementation of such rules, policies and procedures and reviewed our activities and operations to implement a
legal framework that complies with the GDPR requirements.

We believe that we are compliant in all material respects with applicable data protection regulations and we
submitted all the relevant declarations to the national regulators, the CNIL (Commission Nationale de
_l’Informatique et des Libertés) in France and the BfDI (Der Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die_
_Informationsfreiheit) in Germany and the APD (Autorité de protection des données) in Belgium. We have_
appointed a Data Protection Officer, who is registered with the relevant regulator and who is in charge of all
aspects of GDPR for the applicable country and, in particular, maintains data processing registers.

As used herein, “Personal Data” has the meaning set out in the GDPR, “Personal Data Breach” has the meaning
set out in the GDPR, and “Processing” has the meaning set out in the GDPR, and the terms “Process” and
“Processed” shall be construed accordingly.


-----

**_Anti-money Laundering_**

As part of certain operations, we follow anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards set
forth in the applicable local laws implementing Directive (EU) 2005/60/EC on the prevention of the use of the
financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. Our operations are also subject to
requirements of local anti-money laundering laws. On May 20, 2015, Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the
prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing,
amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and repealing Directive 2005/60/EC (the “4th AML Directive”) was
adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. The 4th AML Directive enhances the current customer
due diligence requirements and also imposes stricter sanctions with administrative fines of at least €5,000,000 or
10% of total annual turnover.

Directive (EU) 2018/843 (the “5th AML Directive”), amending the 4th AML Directive, was adopted by the
European Parliament and the Council on May 30, 2018 and since then Directive (EU) 2018/1673 (the “6th AML
Directive”) has been introduced and went into effect for EU Member States on December 3, 2020.

**France**

As a real estate business operating in France with a primary focus on residential real estate property
management and real estate property transaction brokerage, we are subject to the general application of the laws
and regulations provided below. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our
_businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or_
_regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof. If we fail to comply with_
_laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur_
_significant financial penalties.”_

**_Hoguet_**

The Hoguet law (Loi n°70-9 réglementant les conditions d’exercice des activités relatives à certaines opérations
portant sur les immeubles et les fonds de commerce) was introduced in January 1970 and aimed at setting the
legal framework for the profession of real estate agents in France and therefore applies to all of our employees
who act as real estate agents on our behalf. The Hoguet law requires the execution of specific administrative
formalities to be a professional real estate agent including:

    - holding a professional card (“carte professionnelle”) issued by the president of the territorial
chamber of commerce and industry, which is subject to professional aptitude and morality
conditions and is renewable every 3 years;

    - having a financial guarantee from a bank or professional organization for funds held in
customer accounts and retaining professional liability insurance.

In accordance with this law, we provide financial guarantees to customers equal to the maximum amount of
funds held in their account. The customer’s deposit must be held in a third-party account and be guaranteed by
a third party financial guarantor, such as Société de caution mutuelle des professions immobilières et foncières
(SOCAF). This body guarantees reimbursement of any funds deposited with them for purchase. The name of
the financial guarantor must be displayed in the agents office.

Professional real estate agents must have a written mandate authorizing them to negotiate or enter into contracts
on behalf of the owner or the property lessor. This mandate must therefore be finalized before any act of
mediation or negotiation begins. This mandate must indicate the level of the fees or commission (honoraires)
that will be payable and just who will pay it, the buyer or the seller. We maintain a register of such agreements
with each agreement numbered and recorded in accordance with the Hoguet Law.

Once the mandate is signed, the real estate agent is entitled to a commission in the event of the sale or lease of
the property, subject to the mandate. The real estate agent’s right to commission is subject to multiple
conditions and no sum of money may be demanded or remitted to the real estate agent before the transaction
(i.e. sale, rental, etc.) is concluded and recorded in an act containing the commitment of the parties. The
collection of a sum of money in violation of the Hoguet law is an offense punishable by up to two years’
imprisonment and a maximum fine of €30,000.


-----

**_ALUR_**

The ALUR law (Loi n°2014-366 pour l’accès au logement et un urbanisme rénové) was introduced in
March, 2014 and aimed at improving access to housing and providing increased protection to tenants in the
housing market within large cities and urban areas of France. The introduction of the ALUR law has had a
number of effects in the way we conduct our operations across our core service offerings, including:

    - _Joint property management: The_ ALUR law imposes a mandatory obligation on us as joint
property managers to register each joint property we manage with the national matriculation
register if not yet registered and also requires us to create two dedicated bank accounts for
each joint property we manage. The law also introduces model joint property agreements that
are applicable in our joint property management service.

    - _Rental management and lettings: The ALUR law regulates which fees can and cannot be_
charged to tenants and how fees should be shared between tenants and landlords. Depending
on the property’s location, it imposes a limit on the renting commission paid by tenants to an
amount that must not exceed between €11-€15 per square meter. In addition to this fee cap,
tenants can no longer be charged penalties for breaches to rental agreements or for rent
payment notices. The law also introduced restrictions on the yearly rental escalations for
residential properties in Paris. It also standardized certain administrative requirements for
rental contracts through means such as model contracts and rental declaration forms for
residential lettings.

**_ELAN_**

The ELAN law (Loi n°2018-1021 _portant évolution du logement, de l’aménagement et du numérique) was_
introduced in November 2018 and aimed to build more housing, simplify standards, protect the most fragile
tenants and to introduce digital transitions in the service of tenants. The law created a new lease called a
“mobility lease,” which is a non-renewable lease between one to ten months for certain categories of tenants,
such as students and trainees, with flexible termination terms that allow the termination of a lease by the tenant
upon the provision of only one months’ notice. Within municipalities of more than 50,000 inhabitants, where
there is an imbalance between the supply and demand of housing, the law also imposes an obligation on
landlords to set their rent within a range defined by the authorities each year. The introduction of the ELAN law
has had a number of effects in the way we conduct our operations across our core service offerings, as it created
an incentive for short-term rentals which may reduce the predictability of our revenue.

**_PINEL_**

The PINEL plan refers to multiple laws introduced since 2014, which aimed to design and promote the
construction of new build properties in designated areas. The PINEL plan provided income tax deductions to
private individuals who invested in these new build properties, provided the properties were put up for rent for
at least six years. This plan has had a direct impact on fees that property managers can charge for their services.
For example, it restricts the freedom of the landlord and tenant to contract with regards to expenses which
cannot be recovered from tenants. Non-recoverable expenses include structural repairs and repairs under article
606 of the French Civil Code, taxes such as the “Territorial Economic Contribution” where the landlord is
personally liable for payment and the management fees of the landlord linked to rents management. As a result,
landlords are no longer able to recover fees from tenants for certain expenses for major repairs, regional
economic contribution taxes and fees related to rental management.

The PINEL plan also introduced rules governing commercial leases including rules limiting the ability of a
landlord to impose rental increases and granting tenants a right of first refusal in the event of the sale of leased
commercial property. The plan provides for the mandatory use of national indexes provided by the national
statistics bureau of France (INSEE) for the calculation of revised rents for commercial activity premises and is
applicable during the life of the lease.

**_Eviction Laws and the Winter Truce_**

_Eviction Laws_

On July 9, 1991 a new law (Loi n° 91-650 du 9 juillet 1991 portant réforme des procédures civiles d’exécution)
introduced the eviction regime into the law of civil enforcement proceedings. This law introduces, in article


-----

L411-1 of the Code of Civil Enforcement Procedures (code de procédure civile), the condition that an eviction
can only take place by virtue of a court decision where the occupiers were notified. A tenant can be evicted for
failure to pay the rent when due and also for breaches of lease agreements. In the event that the tenant fails to
pay rent, the landlord is required to follow various mandatory steps, including filing of a payment instruction
notice (Commandement de payer). This notice sets a time limit for a tenant to pay the outstanding rental and
must delivered by a bailiff (huissier de justice). The time limits provided by this notice are two months for a
residential lease and one month for a commercial lease. If the tenant fails to pay the rental arears within the
stipulated time, the landlord can apply to the court for the cancellation of the lease. Upon the determination of
the court proceedings, the court will often provide for an installment payment of the rent arrears and stipulate
that the tenant voluntarily move out within a period of two months. The bailiff and the police will forcibly
remove the tenant if the tenant fails to move out within this period.

_Winter Truce_

The winter truce is the period during which any tenant eviction measure is suspended. This rule was introduced
on July 9, 1991 (Loi n° 91-650 du 9 juillet 1991 portant réforme des procédures civiles d’exécution). The
regime provides that a landlord can begin proceedings during the winter truce to seek to evict tenants who do
not pay rent, or who refuse to leave after receiving the contractual notice period. However, eviction requires a
court order from a judge, which can be appealed by the tenant. Once a final judgment is made, the landlord is
able to give an eviction order to the tenant with a minimum notice period of at least two months for the tenant to
vacate the leased premises (the length of this period will depend on the court order). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the eviction of the tenant cannot take place during the winter truce, which is in effect between
November 1 and March 1 of the following year.

In 2014, the ALUR law expanded the winter truce period to five full months, from November 1 to March 31 of
the following year. This period was extended to July 10 as an exceptional measure for 2020 only, as part of the
emergency measures taken by the French government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Management of Rents Deposits_**

In France, the parties are free to enter into any agreed terms regarding rental deposits. The terms of the deposit
should explain what the deposit is expected to cover. For example, the rental deposit terms can provide that the
rent, repairs, service charge, dilapidations and rates are covered. These terms could also be widely drafted to
cover any liabilities owed by the tenant at the end of the tenancy. The amount of the deposit is, in part,
regulated by the law which provides that the maximum amount of the deposit for unfurnished properties will be
one month, with no maximum for furnished properties.

The rent deposit paid at the beginning of the tenancy must be refunded at the end of the rental period. The
landlord or their representative has one month to refund the security deposit if the final inventory is consistent
with the initial inventory and if there is no outstanding rent or tax to be paid. This period may be extended to
two months if there are differences between the initial and final inventories. The time frame to refund the
deposit begins on the day the tenant returns the keys for the premises (in person or by registered letter with
acknowledgement of receipt).

In the event the security deposit is not refunded, the outgoing tenant must send a formal demand to the landlord
by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt. If, despite this action being taken, the landlord refuses to
refund the security deposit, the tenant can refer the case to the regional mediation commission (Commission
_Départementale de Conciliation). If this mediation process proves unsuccessful, the tenant can then go before_
the small-claims court (juge de proximité) if the value of the claim is less than €4,000, or the district court
(tribunal d’instance). If the amount of the security deposit exceeds €4,000, the tenant must send an assignation,
which will be prepared and delivered by a bailiff to the landlord.

shares in any Topco Borrower which is a member of the Senior Secured Group, (iv) all receivables owed by a
member of the Senior Secured Group under any Topco Proceeds Loan (or, in the case of a Topco Borrower
which is a member of the Senior Secured Group, any Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan), (v) any escrow
account relating to the proceeds of any Topco Liabilities, and (vi), any other assets not falling within limbs (i),
(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this paragraph of a Topco Borrower and (to the extent that the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that the granting of such security in favor of the Topco Shared
Security Secured Obligations is not prohibited by the terms of any applicable prior ranking financing
agreements) any other member of the Senior Secured Group, in each case designated as Topco Shared Security
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in its discretion) in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the
other Secured Parties (or if such trustee arrangements are not legally possible, in favor of all the Secured Parties
or in favor of the Security Agent under a parallel debt or similar structure). Topco Shared Security shall secure
all liabilities and present and future obligations of each Topco Borrower that is not a member of the Senior
Secured Group and each of its Subsidiaries other than Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the documents
governing the relevant Topco Liabilities (as the case may be)) (the “Topco Group”), each Debtor and any Third
Party Security Provider to the Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents.

“Transaction Security” refers to security (from the Senior Secured Group, any Third Party Security Provider and
Topco Shared Security (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Topco Independent Transaction Security), as
defined above) in each case which, to the extent legally possible and subject to any Agreed Security Principles
(as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement (i) is created,
or expressed to be created, in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or a
class of Secured Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations; (ii) (in the case of any Transaction
Security governed by French law) is created in favor of the Security Agent as “agent des sûretés” (security
agent) pursuant to articles 2488-6 and following of the French Code civil for the benefit of the other Secured
Parties in respect of the Secured Obligations; or (iii) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security
cannot be granted in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the Secured Parties (or a class of Secured
Parties), is created, or expressed to be created, in favor of (x) all the Secured Parties (or a class of Secured
Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations or (y) the Security Agent under a parallel debt and/or


-----

joint and several creditorship or similar structure for the benefit of all the Secured Parties (or a class of Secured
Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations. Transaction Security which is not Topco Shared
Security shall secure all liabilities and present and future obligations of the Debtors and Third Party Security
Providers to the Secured Parties (other than the creditors under the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Secured
Parties”)) under the Secured Debt Documents (other than the finance documents relating to the Topco Liabilities
(the “Topco Finance Documents”)). Transaction Security which is Topco Shared Security shall secure all
liabilities and present and future obligations of any member of the Topco Group, the Debtors and Third Party
Security Providers to the Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents (including to the Security agent
under the Parallel Debt) both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or
surety or in any other capacity (the “Topco Shared Security Secured Obligations”).

The Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereunder will be Senior Secured Notes Liabilities for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Notes and Note Guarantees thereunder will be Topco
Notes Liabilities for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Designation Date has not occurred. On
the Issue Date, no Second Lien Lender Liabilities or Second Lien Notes Liabilities will be outstanding. Such
liabilities and liabilities in respect of other new debt financings may only be incurred and/or designated if not
prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, including, without limitation, the covenants applicable to the
Notes described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of the
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

**_Guarantees and security: topco creditors_**

The creditors in respect of the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Creditors”) have the right to take, accept or receive
the benefit of:

(i) any Topco Shared Security from any member of the Senior Secured Group or from a Third Party Security
Provider in respect of the Topco Liabilities if and to the extent legally possible and subject to any agreed
security principles, at the same time it is also offered either:

(A) to the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof)
in respect of their Liabilities; or

(B) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be (or is not) granted in favor of
the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof):

a. to the other Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof) in respect of their Liabilities; or

b. to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure, joint and several creditor structure or
agency structure for the benefit of the other Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof),

Security are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under “Application
of Proceeds;”

(ii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance from any member of the Senior Secured Group in respect of
the Topco Liabilities in addition to any guarantee, indemnity or assurance in the original form of any
Topco Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or given to all the Secured Parties as security
for the liabilities of the Topco Group, each Debtor and any Third Party Security Provider to the Secured
Parties under the Debt Documents if, subject to any agreed security principles:

(A) (except for any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance permitted by the Finance Documents), the
Secured Parties other than the Topco Creditors (the “Priority Secured Parties”) already benefit
from such a guarantee, indemnity or other assurance or at the same time it is also offered to the
Priority Secured Parties and ranks in the same order of priority as described under “—Priority of
_Debts” above, as applicable; and_

(B) all amounts received by any Topco Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or
assurance are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds;” and_

(iii) any security, guarantee indemnity or other assurance:

(A) from any person that is not a member of the Senior Secured Group; and


-----

(B) from any member of the Senior Secured Group:

a. in connection with any escrow or similar arrangements relating to amounts held by a person
which is not a member of the Topco Group prior to release of those amounts to a member of
the Topco Group;

b. in connection with any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment,
purchase or other discharge of any Secured Liabilities not prohibited by the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

c. as otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

No security (other than pursuant to the secured documents relating to Topco Independent Transaction Security
or Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a member of the Senior Secured Group in
respect of any Topco Liabilities.

**_New debt financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements or the assumption or incurrence of any Liabilities that
will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco
Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities or Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The
conditions include certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not
prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under
the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each
agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and
instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as
the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking, priority guarantees and Security of the New Debt Financing,
subject to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise
required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, substantially the same (if applicable) as the terms applicable to the
existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who,
after the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a
Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other ownership interests) in any such person
or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting
at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic
testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity
or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any
liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a
contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset required
(including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness
(other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such
Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or
would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend
any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation
thereto.

**_Permitted payments_**

_Permitted payments in respect of the senior and super senior debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility Liabilities (together
with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect thereof being the
“Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Indenture or
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a
member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security
Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “—Application of
_Proceeds”; provided that after the Designation Date there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments_
received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under such
applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted payments in respect of the second lien debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien Liabilities and
Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”),
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the members of the Senior Secured Group and Third Party Security Providers
may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the
finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is
not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture
(or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has
been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a
_de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any_
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash
Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket
amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next paragraph.

_Permitted payments in respect of topco liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second Lien
Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”), the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other members of the Senior
Secured Group may only make specified scheduled payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter,
action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement)
under the Topco Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the
Topco Creditors or any Topco Borrower or any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or other
lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such
payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal,
interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management
Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a “Senior Secured Payment Default”), or
under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and


-----

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is (x) not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit
such payment have been obtained or (y) permitted as a Non-Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) or the result of any claim which is subject to Transaction Security, (2) any other amount
which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest such other amounts including all
scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages)), the
accrual of cash interest otherwise payable during a period when a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as
defined below) is outstanding and default interest on the Topco Liabilities accrued and payable in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance Document (as at the date of the issue of
the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other
Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to
the Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in any Topco Finance
Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back program approved by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as
defined below), or (4) amounts due under any syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco
Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other than
in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower under any
prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (L) below) irrespective of
whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is not
prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any
equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt
Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents,
(B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations
(including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) and a
Topco Agent’s fees, costs and expenses not exceeding €1,500,000, but excluding the costs of any
litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (or their affiliates), (C) of any
amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs necessary to protect, preserve or enforce
security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees (including any original issue
discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably
incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements
under the Topco Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding €5,000,000 in any financial
year of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried
forward and utilized in the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have been used first)),
(G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding)
which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that
amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities
during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be
made if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under
the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, all
or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the
issues of shares in any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (“Debt for Equity Swap”)
provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does
not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance
Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of
the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior
Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior
Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those
Intra-Group Liabilities or Subordinated Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group,
(I) of non-cash interest made by way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is
subordinated on the same terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) of audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other
proper and incidental expenses required to maintain existence or any other reasonable and administrative
and maintenance costs and expenses of a Topco Borrower or its affiliates, (K) funded directly or indirectly
with the proceeds of Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents,


-----

(L) by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and such
payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such payment
is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without
breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the Topco
Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment
upon illegality or any other provision that permits the repayment in full of any Topco Creditor (without a
related requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors) and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and the payment is a payment of principal,
interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities
(provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the relevant
Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the
applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior

consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance
Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco liabilities payment block provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one (1) Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a
“Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien
Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior
Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
“Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under
any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities,
until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop

Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been

remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior
Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop
notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes
Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the

Intercreditor Agreement (see “Ranking and priority—Enforcement regime—Permitted Topco
_enforcement”)._

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event
of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty five (45) days after the occurrence of the relevant
event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event
or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred and sixty (360) days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default
shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event
of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement
Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.


-----

_Payment obligations and capitalization of interest continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization
of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue
of a payment stop notice.

**_Cure of payment stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest to
occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date
and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”)
(the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation
Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below
under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or a
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the

provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which is
not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made
as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,


-----

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on
trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute
that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the
receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from
any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from
the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event
or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Effect of insolvency event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making of an order
for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization (excluding solvent
reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (c) the appointment of a
liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in
respect of it or any of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in
each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is
satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement
or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement
or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall
apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of
_Proceeds.”_

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds.”

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands,
collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give
effect to these provisions.


-----

**_Security enforcement regime_**

_Enforcement of security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as
specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco

Creditors; and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior
Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than fifty (50)% of
the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior
Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Super
Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions
relating to enforcement, it shall mean the Senior Secured Group of Secured Creditors entitled to
give instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of
_Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security_
_on or After the Designation Date;”_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but
before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of
the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors

representing more than fifty (50)% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of transaction security prior to the designation date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease
enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as
defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the
Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or Majority
Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent
neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or
refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction
Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the
Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the
Transaction Security do not give such instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then
the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the
Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing
Group. No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any Transaction
Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents except through
the Security Agent.


-----

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that
to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to
enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any such
instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the creditors represented
by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided that any agent in respect of
Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of
up to ten Business Days or take any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group
will only be entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after
the expiry of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of transaction security on or after the designation date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security
has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement
Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct
the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver
instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later
of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities
(the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of
the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the
Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security
Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors). Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives
of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give
such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement
instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions. No Secured Party shall
have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any Transaction Security or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents except through the Security Agent.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that to the
extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen should
maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and
(iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or
other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so requested by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm
of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—topco independent transaction security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit. No Topco Creditor shall have any independent power to
enforce, or to have recourse to, any Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any
of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under
the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit
(which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the Transaction
Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security Documents except
through the Security Agent.

_Security held by other creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

_Payment of the French Soulte_

If, following the enforcement of any shares or securities pledged under a Security Document governed by
French law by way of appropriation or foreclosure (a “Foreclosure”), a French Soulte (being the amount by
which the value of the shares or securities being appropriated, foreclosed or transferred exceeds the amount of
the relevant secured obligations) becomes due to any Debtor by a Secured Party, such French Soulte shall only
become due and payable by the Secured Parties on the earlier of the date falling nine (9) months after the date
on which such Foreclosure occurs and the Final Discharge Date.

_Permitted Topco enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and

Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a Topco
Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco
Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to
a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a
further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco
Liabilities.

_Option to purchase: topco creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by giving not less than
10 days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, elect to purchase all, but not part of, the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility
Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have
been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors
must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in
exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging


-----

obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such
purchase.

**_Non-distressed disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and
is irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement, instruction,
direction, confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information from any creditor,
other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer to the Security Agent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/
or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal to
a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any
member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document pursuant
to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured
Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance
Document to effect any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any
obligations or take any action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the
Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor simultaneously
with such release to the extent that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such
ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or
such release is otherwise, in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement);

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured
Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other
member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of
the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the Senior
Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt
Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating
to a Debt Document); and

(iii) effect a Debt Transfer (as defined below).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii) above, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not
prohibited as at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, on
the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.


-----

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant
release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the
extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other
transaction or designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a
Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to
voluntarily prepay all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable creditors concurrently
with ceasing to be a member of the Topco Group or Debtor; and any right to decline, delay or prevent any
prepayment in any Debt Document shall be disapplied to the extent that if exercised such right would prevent
the repayment of all such liabilities in full by such person (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, makewhole payment, break costs or other payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of
Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender
Liabilities (each, a “Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise
transferred by that Borrower (a “Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either (A) such Debt Transfer is to another
member of the Senior Secured Group; (B) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any
holding company of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the
proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that
Borrower’s liabilities under the applicable Finance Documents; or (C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in
connection with an IPO, and (ii) the transferee in respect of such Debt Transfer is another borrower under the
Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien lender
Liabilities (as applicable). Any Debt Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and
reborrow any applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member
of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or financial
securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an
acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made, (b) by enforcement
of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for
enforcement was made, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing
or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which has occurred and is
continuing, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the
Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (subject to
acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party
Security Provider and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor:

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered
necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor and
any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any
Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets, and
(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor
over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant
creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to

release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its


-----

borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company or
any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group
lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over
the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a

Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose
of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries to
creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other
provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any
Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and
not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities,
on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed
Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group
liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations
in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving
Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security_
and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or
any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that
release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit,

cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to
the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the provisions described
above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities transferred to a
holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer specified by such creditor, in which case the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such
documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the consent of
each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it is a further
condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(ii) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made (A) pursuant to a public auction
or other competitive sale process conducted with the advice of a reputable, independent and
internationally recognized investment bank or firm of accountants or (if all such banks or firms are
conflicted), a reputable, independent and internationally recognized third party professional firm which is
regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject to
the relevant Transaction Security and, in each case, not being an auditor or administrator or other relevant
officer of the applicable company (a “Financial Advisor”) as selected by the Security Agent (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Advisor until it
has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in respect of which the Secured
Creditors are entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or (B) where a Financial Adviser
selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Senior
Secured Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured
Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds
received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view
taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless
it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction
Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors
and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed of
(a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all
security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the
assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent and
Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior
Secured Creditors will recover a greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise
transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such
amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities,
which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent and Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide
and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of
Senior Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,


-----

then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to
the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can be
relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien
Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered
in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account
all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the
Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs and
(v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security securing Topco Liabilities
will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the provisions described above, it is a further condition to
any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors
and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed of
(a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all
security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the
assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent, Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting
reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Priority Secured Parties will recover a greater
cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its
affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the
aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case
if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and
trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines
that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of
the outstanding amount of the Priority Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the
Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell
and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Senior Secured Group which can be
relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien
Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered
in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account
all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the
Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the relevant
Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with the
provisions set out under “—Manner of enforcement” above, and (ii) in any other case on the instructions of the
Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include
taking no action).

the French Soulte (if any) remain unpaid after the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are


-----

taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified
class in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate
exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will
make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such
a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties,
and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class
of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely
to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant agent or trustee
acting on behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty)
shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority
or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior
Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would

such)),

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially

(iv) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or
authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate
to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

**_Amendments and waivers: transaction security documents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
(a) may, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party, and (b) may if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
consents, and shall promptly upon request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, amend, release and/or retake any
document creating Transaction Security where such amendment, release and/or retake is required in order to
ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the relevant Transaction Security, together with any related or
consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to register any relevant document with Companies House
within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security
Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to
register) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each Party.

Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security
or Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or the manner in which
the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are
distributed, such amendment may not be made without the prior consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees other than an agent under any Cash Management Facility, if appointed
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,


-----

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash Management Facility on its
behalf but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement in
their capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other
creditor or class of creditors,

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially

adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)), and

(iv) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including any ability of
that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the
consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular_
to:

(ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the
provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed
_Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant_
provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Security Agent.

**_Snooze/Lose_**

If in relation to:

(i) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(ii) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose
provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(iii) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt

Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

(iv) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt

Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

then, in each case, any creditor:

(A) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision to
operate is less than ten (10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(B) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent:

1. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s participation (as the case may be)
shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating their participation in respect of the matter
when ascertaining whether any relevant percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
unanimity) of their participation or has been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or
approve that action;


-----

2. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s status shall be disregarded for the
purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of creditors has been
obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve that action; and

3. in the case of paragraph (iv) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been
given,

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any Noteholder
in respect of any request where such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the
negative but shall otherwise apply to all Noteholders.

**_Provisions following an IPO_**

On or following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with respect to the release of Transaction
Security if required to implement such IPO Event), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to give notice
to each agent and each Hedge Counterparty (a “Pushdown Notice”) that the terms of the Debt Documents will
automatically operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown
_Date”)) so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to_
the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer who will issue
shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if Topco Liabilities
are outstanding following the IPO Pushdown Date and the Topco Borrower is a Holding Company of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial
ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting
obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) each reference in the Debt
Documents to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be

default), will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (v) no event, matter or
circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall directly or indirectly result in a
breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking of event of default, (vi) each holding company of the IPO

the Debt Documents (including as a Borrower, Guarantor or Debtor) and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in
the Senior Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be irrevocably and unconditionally released
from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

In connection with an IPO Event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be permitted to (i) release any
Transaction Security granted over the shares in the capital of the IPO Pushdown Entity (including prior to the
settlement of such initial public offering if required pursuant to applicable capital markets laws or regulations or
the rules of any applicable stock exchange), (ii) release any guarantees or Transaction Security, or as the case
may be, Topco Independent Transaction Security granted by any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
(including prior to the settlement of such initial public offering if required pursuant to applicable capital markets
laws or regulations or the rules of any applicable stock exchange), (iii) novate any of the Liabilities of the IPO
Pushdown Entity or any of its Holding Companies to a Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity, provided that
such Subsidiary is incorporated in the same jurisdiction as the relevant IPO Pushdown Entity or holding
company (as applicable), (iv) amend the definitions of Topco Group and Group in the Debt Documents, such
that such definitions shall exclude the IPO Pushdown Entity and/or its Holding Companies, and (v) amend the
definitions of Topco, the Company, any borrower or any issuer in the Debt Documents to facilitate the

Change of Control (as defined in the relevant Debt Document), in each case, provided that following such
transactions, the Liabilities shall benefit from substantially equivalent Transaction Security to that granted prior
to the IPO Event, but as though references therein to: (A) the Company were to any person which becomes the
Company in accordance with paragraph (v) above; and (B) Topco were to any person which becomes Topco in
accordance with paragraph (v) above.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities, noteholders

in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes
Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more
than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown


-----

Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from
the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document
required to facilitate such matters.

**_Agreement to override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary.

**Preferred Equity Certificates**

On September 5, 2016, the Senior Notes Issuer issued 358,027,095 preferred equity certificates (“PECs”) of a
nominal value of €1.00 each. The PECs are held by Flamingo Lux I S.à r.l., the majority shareholder of the
Senior Notes Issuer. As of December 31, 2020, €358,027,095 were outstanding under the PECs, with capitalized
interest of €190,425,295.68 and accrued interest of €10,721,167.53. The PECs have a maturity date of the later
of September 7, 2045 and six months following the final maturity date of any priority liabilities. Each PEC
carries a right to return calculated and payable in arrears at a rate equal to equal to 11.5% per annum, computed
on three hundred and sixty (360) days per year and the actual number of days elapsed. The PECs are governed
by Luxembourg law and are held by Flamingo Lux I S.à r.l. In connection with the Transactions, as part of the
contemplated distribution to shareholders, the Senior Notes Issuer intends to repay part of the PECs.

**Lease Liabilities**

We reported €107.0 million of lease liabilities as non-current liabilities and €50.7 million of lease liabilities as
current liabilities as at December 31, 2020. The liabilities will remain outstanding following completion of the
Transactions. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain changes in accounting_
_standards and accounting policies—IFRS-16.”_

**Hedging Agreements**

We currently maintain certain derivatives, including certain interest rate hedging instruments to manage our
exposure to interest rate movements on our financial debt. Given the prevailing negative interbank interest rate
environment, these derivative instruments had a fair value of zero as at December 31, 2020.

Notes Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be
entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a
qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain
conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

The Company intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, together with the
proceeds from Topco Notes to be issued by Topco on the Issue Date and drawings under the Senior Term Loan
(i) to repay amounts outstanding under our Existing Senior Facilities, (ii) as funds earmarked for identified
acquisitions anticipated to close during the first half of 2021, (iii) to make a distribution to shareholders and (iv)
to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of
indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of
security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you
should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and your rights.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not
be, registered under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

    - be general senior obligations of the Company, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of the Company that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the obligations
of the Company under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including the
Company’s obligations under its guarantee of the Topco Notes);


-----

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the
Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
obligation or indebtedness;

    - be Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the
Company that are not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

    - mature on March 31, 2028; and

    - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). See
“Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the Company that is secured on the
Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees,
including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations, provided that,
subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” certain credit facility Indebtedness and certain Hedging Obligations may be designated as_
having super senior priority pursuant to the operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case, such super
senior priority Indebtedness will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Interests in the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—If the New Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a_
_super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes_
_Indenture, creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations_
_and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the_
_Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility, are entitled to be repaid_
_with proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured_
_Notes.”_

The Company is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own and no business operations,
material assets or liabilities other than its shares in Foncia Holding and its operations are conducted through its
Subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company depends on the receipt of funds from its Subsidiaries (whether in the form
of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or payments with respect to intercompany obligations) to meet
its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will be
structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our_
Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Notes are expected to be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by (i) on the Issue Date, Foncia
Holding and Foncia Groupe (the “Issue Date Guarantors”) and (ii) within 180 days from (and excluding) the
Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees
granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, Foncia Transaction France, Assurimo,
Assurimo Paris and Foncia Lyon (the “Post-Issue Date Guarantors” and together with the Issue Date
Guarantors, the “Guarantors”) on a senior secured basis. In addition, if required by the covenant described under
“Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes
Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.


-----

Once granted, the Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

    - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including
such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations);

    - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Notes Guarantee, including such Guarantor’s
obligations under its guarantee of the Topco Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that
Guarantor and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the
Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and
assets securing such indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable
law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Notes Guarantees will be further
limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Notes Guarantees—
_General.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be_
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of
_Notes—The insolvency laws of France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as_
_the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_
_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Company will issue €400 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Notes will mature on March 31, 2028. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt,
Euroclear and Clearstream are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum denomination.

**Interest on the Senior Secured Notes**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.375% per annum. Interest on the Senior Secured
Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrear on March 31 and September 30, commencing on September 30,
2021. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes
on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already
been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

If the Company redeems any Global Notes on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date
will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the
close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior
Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.


-----

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Senior Secured Notes
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear
and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents. In addition,
interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the
address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive Registered Notes.
See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes.”

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive payments on the Senior
Secured Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due
to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Company will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes (the “Paying Agent”). The
initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Company will also maintain a registrar (the
“Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services
DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together
with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Company.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for
the Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. The Company or
any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €400 million
aggregate principal amount Senior Secured Notes will be issued in this offering. The Company may issue
additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”) from time to time under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. Any series of Additional Senior Secured Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Senior
Secured Notes originally issued, except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate (defined below) supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall
bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates
on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the
record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis
upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be denominated and
the currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Senior Secured Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;


-----

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued and
redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Senior Secured Notes.

Such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Secured Notes, as a single
class for the purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other
matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series in such Officer’s Certificate; provided that any
Additional Senior Secured Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes offered
hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN, Common Code or other securities
identification number from such Senior Secured Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to “Senior
Secured Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue
Date as well as any Additional Senior Secured Notes. Additional Senior Secured Notes may be designated to be
of the same series as a series of Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have
terms substantially identical in all material respects to such series of initial Senior Secured Notes, and shall be
deemed to form one series and references to such series of Senior Secured Notes shall be deemed to include the
Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well any such Additional Senior Secured Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

The obligations of the Company pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment obligation
resulting from a Change of Control Triggering Event, will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior
secured basis by the Guarantors (each, a “Notes Guarantee” and together, the “Notes Guarantees”).

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company, the Guarantors and the Pledged Opcos generated 54.3%
of our consolidated EBITDA (and 33.8% excluding Pledged Opcos). As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries
that will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes had €7.4 million of indebtedness, excluding accrued interest,
bank overdraft and deposits and guarantees received. Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Company and Preferred Stock of
Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Definitions—
_Indebtedness.”_

In addition, as described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Senior
Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of the Company or a Guarantor, will
also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the
granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other
legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules,
“thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the
time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any
comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The insolvency laws of France and_


-----

_the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or_
_those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability.”_

A portion of the operations of the Company are conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become
Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if
any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior
Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade
creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the
Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

**_Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of such Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as provided in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction
_and Discharge,” respectively;_

(4) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”;_

(7) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, provided that such Guarantor also releases its Note Guarantee under the
Topco Notes;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(9) as described under “IPO Pushdown”;

(10) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes;

(11) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Senior Secured Notes; or

(12) as a result of a transaction permitted by “Merger and Consolidation.”

Subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
customary protections and indemnifications, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, shall take all
necessary actions at the reasonable written request and cost of the Company, including the granting of releases
or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any
release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, without the consent of the Holders and will not
require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable. Neither


-----

the Trustee, the Security Agent nor the Company will be required to make a notation on the Senior Secured
Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or around the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note
Guarantees thereof will be secured on a first priority basis by:

    - a share pledge granted by Topco in respect of shares held by it in the Company;

    - an intercompany receivables pledge granted by Topco in respect of structural intercompany
receivables owing to it by the Company;

    - an account pledge granted by the Company in respect of its material bank accounts;

    - a share pledge granted by the Company in respect of shares held by it in Foncia Holding;

    - a share pledge granted by Foncia Holding in respect of shares held by it in Foncia Groupe;

    - an intercompany receivables pledge granted by the Company in respect of structural
intercompany receivables owing to it by Foncia Holding; and

    - an intercompany receivables pledge granted by the Company in respect of structural
intercompany receivables owing to it by Foncia Groupe, (collectively, the “Issue Date
Collateral”).

Within 180 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially
simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Note Guarantees thereof will be secured by:

    - a share pledge granted by Foncia Groupe over shares held by it in Foncia Transaction France,
Assurimo, Foncia Lyon and the Pledged Opcos;

    - a share pledge granted by Foncia Lyon over shares held by it in Foncia Vallée Du Rhône; and

    - a share pledge granted by Assurimo over shares held by it in Assurimo Paris (collectively the
“Post-Issue Date Collateral” and together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The Security Interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of
the Holders pursuant to the Security Documents. The Collateral will also secure on a first-priority basis the
liabilities under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations, and may also secure certain future
Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Interests in the Collateral may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Company and the_
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances
of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements
described herein, Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the
Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other assets subject
to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, any
Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Security
Interests in the Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Notes Guarantees granted by the
same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent


-----

conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that certain property, rights and assets_
may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected),
in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. For a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the
Agreed Security Principles as they apply to the Senior Facilities, and which will apply to the Senior Secured
Notes, mutatis mutandis, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement.”

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. By
its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the_
_Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such_
_collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (such security interests, the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the
lenders under the Senior Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, (c) the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (d) the trustee and the
security agent with respect to any Topco Notes and the holders of the Topco Notes, and (e) the creditors of
certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured
by such Collateral, respectively, are established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides,
among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations, if
any, and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests in the
Collateral, provided, however, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain Indebtedness and certain Hedging Obligations may be
designated as having super senior priority pursuant to the operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, in which
case, such super senior priority Indebtedness will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Security
Interests in the Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—If the New Revolving Credit Facility is designated
_as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured_
_Notes Indenture, creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_
_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes_
_Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility, are_
_entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over_
_the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, Topco, the Company and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral
to secure the payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents will be
entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When
entering into such Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the
secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such
parties.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, only the Security Agent (or, if the collateral represented by the Security Documents is held
by a creditor other than the Security Agent, that creditor) will have the right to enforce the Security Documents
on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be


-----

entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except
through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (or such creditor) for the Collateral (as
applicable). See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The
_granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the_
_incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security_
_interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or
the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be_
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral
and the trustee of the Topco Notes have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Secured Note, will
be deemed (without any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on
its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—In certain jurisdictions, security
_over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The_
_ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_


-----

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Merger and Consolidation”), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture or (b) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be
relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany
loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization
Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a
Lien in favor of the Senior Secured Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets of, and Capital Stock issued by, such
Guarantor;

(3) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as
provided in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge,” respectively;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness that
gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “Merger and Consolidation”; provided
_that in such a transaction where the Company or any Guarantor ceases to exist, the Lien on the Capital_
Stock of the Company or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the Capital Stock of the successor entity
pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent to the existing Lien on the Capital
Stock of the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the holder of such Capital Stock;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and
assets of, and Capital Stock issued by, such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets
designated by the Company as Receivables Assets in connection with a Receivables Facility;

(9) as described under “IPO Pushdown”; or

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by,
and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the
Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases
set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the
part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee
shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying


-----

which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that
such release complies with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest
coupons attached, as follows:

    - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global
_Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in_
the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream; and

    - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with
the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000, and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and
any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is
expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as
otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend
with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee
at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes
in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any definitive registered Senior Secured Notes:

(1) For a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) For a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) For a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) Which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer of an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Company, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,” the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries._
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Senior
Secured Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to March 31, 2024, the Company may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at
its option, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to March 31, 2024, the Company may, at its option, during each
calendar year redeem up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes,
including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, upon giving notice as described under “—Selection and
_Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so_
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption
date.

At any time and from time to time prior to March 31, 2024, the Company may, at its option, redeem Senior
Secured Notes, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash Proceeds received by
the Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 103.375% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of
the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured
Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture remains
outstanding immediately thereafter.


-----

At any time and from time to time on or after March 31, 2024, the Company may redeem the Senior Secured
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to
the percentage of principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date
and Additional Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the period beginning on March 31, of the year indicated
below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2024 ................................................................................................................................................... 101.68750%
2025 ................................................................................................................................................... 100.84375%
2026, and thereafter ........................................................................................................................... 100.00000%

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Senior Secured Notes,
including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw
such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party making such a tender offer
in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes of such
series, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered
to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not
included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to,
but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture regarding Senior Secured Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the
Company or its Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Senior
Secured Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Senior Secured
Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Company or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the
Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and
such determination.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we may
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “Selection and Notice.”

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior
Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to
purchase Senior Secured Notes as described under “Change of Control” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit their participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on
such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no BookEntry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Senior Secured Notes are
not held through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method of selection the
Senior Secured Notes will be selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior Secured Note
in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Senior
Secured Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior
Secured Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph.


-----

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at the address
of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured
Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control,
an Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If
such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall
describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption or
repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of
redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Company in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Company in
its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or
that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s sole discretion if the Company determines that
any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Company may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Company’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Company may redeem Senior Secured Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions
made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different
provisions will have different redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption
date to the Holder in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record
date in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will
be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Company will notify the Authority of any such notice to the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the
Authority of any change in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Definitive Registered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Definitive Registered Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case
a portion of the original Definitive Registered Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will
be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior
Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior
Secured Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Company may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all
Additional Amounts, as defined below under “Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due
on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Company determines in good faith
that, as a result of:


-----

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would
be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Company or another
Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be
publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing
provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one
payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor
Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring
after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to
the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to
effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to
so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the
relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel
of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the relevant taxing jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the effect that the Payor
has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee
will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it
will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority`s
interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Notes Guarantee
is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of
such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in
respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such


-----

withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on
account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant
Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a
citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in
or place of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of
such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under
such Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any
such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner
or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only
to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Secured
Note for payment (where Senior Secured Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment by or on behalf of
a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant
Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state
of the European Union;

(7) any Taxes imposed to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Company or any
Guarantor (including, without limitation, being a shareholder of the Company or any Guarantor) other
than the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment
or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(8) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474
of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or
similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(9) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under Section 3406 of the Code; or

(10) any combination of the items (1) through (9) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or
settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have


-----

been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior
Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent).
Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured
Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable
and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to
pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such
Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior
Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and (where applicable) reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from
the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Senior
Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, or any other document or instrument
in relation thereto other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this
offering and, solely to the extent of such Taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any
payments of principal or interest on the Senior Secured Notes, any such Taxes or similar charges or levies that
would have been excluded under clauses (1) through (10) above (other than clause (4)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in
which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i)
a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Company has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes as described under “Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of
the Senior Secured Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof; provided _that Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in_


-----

whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control
Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer
electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail,
with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or
otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction
or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier
than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional
Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Company will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action
letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the
event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem
the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event
may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities lenders to
accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or the Restricted
Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a
Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control
or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the
Company to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Company.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of
the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of
us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature
is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to
Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the
event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering
Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured
Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under “Optional
_Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable_
redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in
the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of


-----

Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change
of Control Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering
Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer
to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or
modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of
Control Offer.

**IPO Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide (and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes shall be subject to such
provisions) that the Company or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and
the Security Agent) that the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date
specified in such notice) as described in “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—
_Provisions following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required (at the expense of the_
Company) to enter into any amendment to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Security Documents required by the Company and/or take
such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated
by this paragraph. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—There are circumstances other
_than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note_
_Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining_
_your further consent.”_

**Certain Covenants**

###### Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below. 

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that (x) the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and (y) no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, then, beginning on
that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to the following covenants (the “Suspended Covenants”):

    - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

    - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

    - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

    - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

    - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;


-----

    - “—Additional Guarantees”;

    - “—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

    - provisions of clause (3)(i) of the first paragraph under “Merger and Consolidation—
Company.”

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended
Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”)
and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including in connection with
performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture), unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attains Investment Grade Status (in which
event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Secured Notes maintain
an Investment Grade Status); provided that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed
to exist under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none
of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended
Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such
actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during
such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is
referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(A) of the second paragraph
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted
Liens pursuant to paragraph (k) of such definition.

Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” above had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension_
Period and accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during
any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.”

Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action
described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period_
shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.”

On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to
consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as
such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

Any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant
Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock, provided that the Company and any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company may issue
Disqualified Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the Applicable Test

paragraph (B) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio under this paragraph (C) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date);
_plus_

a Permitted Collateral Lien but is not Senior Secured Indebtedness (“Junior Secured
_Indebtedness”) such that, on the date of determination, after giving pro forma effect to such_
Incurrence (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (I) the Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed

Subsidiaries is at least 2.00:1.00 (in each case with any Indebtedness Incurred under paragraph

calculation made on any such subsequent date); plus

(E) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness or Junior Secured
Indebtedness, such that, on the date of determination, on a pro forma basis for such Incurrence
(including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (I) the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 6.40:1.00 or
(II) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least
2.00:1.00 (in each case with any Indebtedness Incurred under paragraph (B) above on the date of
determination of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under this paragraph (E) on such date of determination but not,
for the avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent
date),

_provided that in each case any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness_
Incurred or deemed to be Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (1) may at any time without restriction,
condition or use of other permission (A) be refinanced at any time if the principal amount of the

amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (1) on the date of
determination for such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness or

Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
of the Company; and (B) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories of Permitted Indebtedness or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify,
such item of Indebtedness and will only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this
covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) in the first paragraph of this covenant or one of the clauses of the second paragraph,
and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to the second paragraph of this covenant (other than clauses (1)(C), (1)(D) and (1)(E) of
the second paragraph of this covenant), if at any time that the Company would be entitled to have
Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph or clauses (1)(C),
(1)(D) and (1)(E) of the second paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall (unless
otherwise elected by the Company) be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph or clauses (1)(C), (1)(D) and (1)(E) of the second paragraph
of this covenant, as applicable; provided that all Indebtedness under the Senior Term Loan
outstanding on the Issue Date (and any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof) shall be deemed to have
been Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(A)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Company
shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or
“clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this
covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date
of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums (including tender premiums), penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued
and unpaid interest, and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and
other costs, fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees in
respect of such Refinancing Indebtedness) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or the
second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;


-----

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium)
or the liquidation preference thereof;

(8) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under
a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to paragraph (cc) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if
any) for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option, either at the Applicable
Test Date or: (A) be determined (i) on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or
increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Company, a
portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (in each case, pursuant to any letter, agreement or instrument, which may be
conditional, including as to documentation) and/or (ii) on the date on which such facility or
commitments become available (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the
Company, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or
other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time,
any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this paragraph (A) shall be
(in each case, solely to the extent that such committed amount, when borrowed or reborrowed, would
constitute Indebtedness) the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, and, to the extent of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be
deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such sub-paragraphs); or (B) be determined on the date
such amount is borrowed or utilized pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in
each case, the Company may revoke such determination and/or make an alternate determination at
any time and from time to time;

(9) (without prejudice to any other permitted basis as elected by the Company for calculating the
conditions set out below otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) in the event that
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (w) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an acquisition (including
an acquisition of assets), Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, capital
expenditure or other or similar transaction, (x) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are, or secured
by assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into,
amalgamated or consolidated with, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (y) commits to an acquisition or transaction pursuant to
which it may Incur Acquired Indebtedness or (z) is subject to a Change of Control or a Permitted
Change of Control, the date of determination of LTM EBITDA, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the
Company, be the Applicable Test Date or: (A) any date that a commitment, letter or agreement, put
option or similar arrangement (conditional or otherwise (including any documentation condition)) for
such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, Change of Control or Permitted
Change of Control is entered into and the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma


-----

effect to such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, Change of Control or
Permitted Change of Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith
(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the
definition of the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt: (i) if any such ratios or covenant
baskets are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio or covenant baskets (including due to
fluctuations in the Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the target company) at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant transaction, such ratios or covenant baskets will not be deemed to have
been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such
acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or
other transaction and any related transactions are permitted hereunder; and (ii) such ratios or covenant
baskets shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such acquisition, transaction, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control; provided that if the
Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement,
put option or similar arrangement, (I) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the
date the definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture after the
date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the
date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and (II) to the
extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed
utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction or the date such
agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction but any
calculation of LTM EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not
reflect such acquisition until it has been consummated, unless such other Incurrence of Indebtedness
or Liens is conditional or contingent on the occurrence of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction; or (B) the date
such Indebtedness is borrowed or assumed or such Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control
occurs;

(10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary is subject to a Permitted Change of Control,

the calculation of LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio or any component thereof (each an “Applicable Definition”) for the purposes of, at the election
of the Company: (x) the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event; (y) the Incurrence of any
Indebtedness in connection with a Permitted Change of Control; and (z) the making of any Restricted
Payment in connection therewith may be (without prejudice to any other permitted basis as elected by
the Company for calculating the conditions in paragraph (x) to (z) above otherwise permitted by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture): (A) by reference to, at the election of the Company, either: (I) if no
financial statements have yet been delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Reports”, the Issue
Date, with such Applicable Metric determined by reference to the financial information set out in this
Offering Memorandum; (II) the most recent quarter end date for which financial statements have been
delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Reports”, with such Applicable Definition determined
by reference to such financial statements; or (III) the last date of the most recently completed
Relevant Period for which the Group has sufficient available information to be able to determine such
Applicable Metric (with such Applicable Metric determined by reference to such available
information) on or prior to (1) any time of any commitment, letter or agreement (conditional or
otherwise (including any documentation condition)) to enter into the relevant transaction which
would on consummation result in a Permitted Change of Control; or (2) the date upon which the
Permitted Change of Control occurs (the “Applicable Test Parameters”); and (B) pro forma for any
Indebtedness expected to be repaid on or prior to the completion date of the Permitted Change of
Control, and any reduction in such ratio after giving pro forma effect to the use of proceeds arising in
connection with the Permitted Change of Control (including any shareholder injection, or increase to
balance sheet cash received by the Group) and after giving pro forma effect to synergies and cost
savings arising from or relating to the Permitted Change of Control, and to the extent satisfied by
reference to the Applicable Test Parameters, such condition shall be deemed to be satisfied even if
such condition is not satisfied on any subsequent date or by reference to any other applicable test


-----

parameters whether as a result of fluctuations in any basket, ratio or exchange rate after such date
without prejudice to the right of the Company to select any other Applicable Test Parameters from
time to time;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to

refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph or any clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant above measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the
applicable date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing,
such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs,
indemnities, discounts, penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any
related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other costs, fees and expenses
(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable and fees in
connection with such refinancing;

(12) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the

principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of IFRS and in the case of any other Indebtedness, with the principal amount or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(13) If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is

committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is
undertaken, in reliance on a ratio-based basket including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the
commitment or Incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility
or any other Credit Facility available to be redrawn (including under any Revolving Facility or
Ancillary Facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement).

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this covenant and
_provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in_
the Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest,
accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such
increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or
threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred
or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken, in reliance on a ratio-based
basket including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, and such ratiobased basket is a “no worse than test”, (including clause (5)(B)(ii) of the second paragraph of this covenant), at
the option of the Company, the applicable amount of indebtedness for each such financial ratio shall be
increased pro forma and prior to the application of such test calculated as if all Permitted Indebtedness had been
drawn in full (including clause (1)(B) of the second paragraph of this covenant).

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on, at the Company’s option, the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred, provided _that notwithstanding anything in the Senior Secured_
Notes Indenture, for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Company may elect to account
for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on


-----

the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness, and further provided that if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) penalties, interest
or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or
similar fees and other fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitted such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

equity of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise received by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (y) any net proceeds described in the preceding subclause (x) shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the amount available for distribution
pursuant to clause (b) of this first paragraph of this covenant and shall not be Excluded
Contributions or Excluded Amounts; and (z) in the case that any net proceeds described in the
preceding sub-clause (x) are contributed to or received by the Company or the Restricted

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment or

Permitted Payments described in the preceding paragraph and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph
of this covenant and/or (iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Company will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case, portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify
(based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment
(or, in each case, portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including in each case as an
Investment pursuant to one or more of the paragraphs of the definition of “Permitted Investments” and may
aggregate capacity in multiple paragraphs of the definition of “Permitted Payments” above, the first paragraph
of this covenant and/or in the definition of “Permitted Investments” in any manner that complies with this
covenant. With respect to the making of any distribution or other payment contemplated in this covenant
including any Restricted Payment and any Investment, compliances with any condition of this covenant shall be
determined (at the election of the Company) (i) on the date on which such distribution or payment is paid (ii) the
date on which such distribution or payment is declared or committed to be paid (conditionally or otherwise); (iii)
as otherwise set out in this covenant (and, in each case, the Company may revoke such determination and elect
another determination date as contemplated above) and/or (iv) the Applicable Test Date.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value of the asset(s) or
securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its
face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash
shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise
acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any of the Company’s Restricted
Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the
Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or Topco to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and, in the case of Topco, only to the extent that such property or assets
constitute Collateral), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (i)
in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (A) Permitted Liens; or (B) Liens on
property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are
directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated
Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured; and
(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.


-----

Any Lien created in favor of the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to sub-clause
(i)(B) of the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the
release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to
constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities), (b)
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other agreement
or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or
was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding
on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor

Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

service, supply, purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Company or any of the Restricted

arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any
such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken
as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Facilities or the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, together with the Security Documents associated therewith, or the
indenture governing any Topco Notes, together with any security document associated therewith, and
(B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in

the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes or (y) such
encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement
or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

under “—Limitation on Liens;” or

(15) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (15) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in
any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14)
of this paragraph or this clause (15); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less


-----

favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by

way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company, of the
shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset

Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap or relates to Non-Core Assets), with a purchase price in excess
of the greater of (x) €48.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration
from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalent Investments or Temporary Cash
Investments, provided that this clause (2) shall not apply to the first amount of consideration from such
Asset Dispositions per fiscal year not to exceed the greater of (x) €48.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM
EBITDA; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required

by the terms of any Indebtedness) to prepay, repay or purchase any Permitted Indebtedness (in
each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) or any
Senior Secured Indebtedness, any Refinancing Indebtedness, or any other Indebtedness under any
Credit Facility Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(A) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Indebtedness secured by a Lien on
property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Permitted Collateral
Liens) within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt
of such Net Available Cash, provided that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or
purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an
amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased, provided further that to the
extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any
amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has extended such offer to
the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes on at least a pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in
respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders of Senior Secured Notes) elect
not to tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the
Company will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount
not tendered under this clause (a), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess
Proceeds;

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in

Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that a binding agreement or commitment shall
be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with
the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy
such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the
event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net
Available Cash are applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such
cancellation or termination; _provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or_


-----

terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall
constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided that (i) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (ii) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may
elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given
Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of execution
of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset
Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with
paragraph (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition; and (iii) notwithstanding any term of this
paragraph, to the extent that (I) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset
Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to
comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial
assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors,
AIFMD and any other law or by any organizational documents or any agreement) or (II) a distribution
of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or
another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in
material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, the portion of
such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this
paragraph.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to
be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, provided that, if at the date of any definitive agreement, put option or
similar arrangement in respect of any Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Company) the date on which Net
Available Cash from an Asset Disposition is received, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is (a) greater than 5.40:1.00 (b) less than or equal to 5.40:1.00 but
greater than 4.90:1.00 or (c) less than or equal to 4.90:1.00, then, in the case of paragraph (a), 0% of the Net
Available Cash from such Asset Disposition, or, in the case of paragraph (b), 50% of the Net Available Cash
from such Asset Disposition, or, in the case of paragraph (c), 100% of the of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition shall be deemed not to constitute Excess Proceeds and may be used by the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

On the 366th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant or such later date as set
forth in clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant, or such earlier date as the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiaries may elect) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture exceeds the greater
of €80.0 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company will within ten Business Days
be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of any other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness,
to, respectively: (i) repay the Senior Secured Notes (and only to the extent any Senior Secured Notes are
outstanding) at par; and (ii) repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of
the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment,
prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Company will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a
copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the
transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured
Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10
days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing
obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition
Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer
period as provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.


-----

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds,
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders
or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the Excess
Proceeds among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a
pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness provided that the Company shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Secured Notes or
other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition
Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Company may, at its option, make
an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of
such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net
Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may use
such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euro that is actually received by the Company upon converting such
portion into Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such
Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the

transferee that are converted (or reasonably expected to be converted) by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalent Investments within 180 days following the closing
of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such

Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)

received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in

such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during the same fiscal year, not to exceed
the greater of (x) €80.0 million and (y) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each
item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value) (with unused amounts in any fiscal year being carried forward to
the next succeeding fiscal year and amounts that will not be used in the subsequent fiscal year being
carried back to the immediately preceding fiscal year);

(6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and

(7) any combination of the consideration specified in paragraphs (1) to (6) above.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Company will comply with the
applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.


-----

Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the
Company from purchasing any Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is
prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the
purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.
If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from
purchasing the Senior Secured Notes under such instruments.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x) €32.0 million and (y) 10.0% of
LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x)
€48.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, provided that
any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this
clause (2) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of
the Company, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” above or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or

program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term
incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans, transaction bonuses or
transaction related securities repurchase plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or

ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalent Investments and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the
Company, any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and
including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors,
consultants, distributors or employees);


-----

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of

disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in
the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior management
of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those
that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity which would
constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely: (A) because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or
any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder
owns an equity interest in, or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; or (B)
due to the fact that a director of such Person is also a director of the Company or any direct or

director of the Company or such direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company, as the case may
be, on any matter involving such other Person);

or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a Default.

If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary: (i) the aggregate fair market value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will
reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” above or under one or more paragraphs of the definition of Permitted Payments or_
Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company; (ii) that designation will only be permitted if the
Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary; and (iii) that designation must be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies the preceding paragraph and this paragraph and
was permitted by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements set out in the preceding
paragraph as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date
under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default of such
covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation (i) will be deemed to be
an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary; (ii) will only be permitted if (A) the Indebtedness described in sub-clause (i) is permitted under the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (5) of the second
paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro
forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the Applicable Test Date; and (B) no Event of Default would
be in existence immediately following such designation; and (iii) must be evidenced to the Trustee on the date


-----

of such designation, by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies
with this paragraph.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following
reports following the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, 150 days) after the end of

each subsequent fiscal year of the Company, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021,
annual reports (the “Annual Financial Statements”) containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the most recent two fiscal years, including
appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years and the
report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial review of
the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results
of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company; (iii)
unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates
(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent
available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in the case
of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iv) a brief description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of
all material debt instruments; provided that the information described in clause (iv) may be provided in
the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021, 90 days) following the end

of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company beginning with the fiscal
quarter ending March 31, 2021, quarterly year-to-date financial statements (the “Quarterly Financial
_Statements”) containing the following information: (i) the Company’s unaudited condensed_
consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income
and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii)
unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates;
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available_
without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iii) an operating and financial review of the
unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any

acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the
Company or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so
long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by Persons who are not
“affiliates” under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial
statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods
presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set
forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the


-----

Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not
be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s LTM EBITDA (calculated (i) in
the case of an acquisition, including any pro forma adjustments in respect of such acquisition and (ii) in the case
of a disposal, excluding any pro forma adjustments in respect of such disposal) for the most recent four quarters
for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Company, then the Annual Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Statements will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the
SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or
information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to
the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be,
required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Company or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of Euronext, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the
Stockholm Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Swiss Stock
Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, any recognized investment exchange (as that term is used in the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) or any other exchange or market in any jurisdiction or country) (each
a “Regulated Market”) and the Company or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and
disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on a Regulated Market, for so
long as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Company, such Parent Entity or such IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with
the applicable Regulated Market pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the
foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the Company, any Parent Entity or IPO
Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the applicable
Regulated Market, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the
preceding paragraphs.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant
by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company so long as
such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and
time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to such Parent Entity
and (b) are accompanied by condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for:
(i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other
Subsidiaries of any applicable Parent Entity that are not the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a
combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts, none of which shall be
required to be audited. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, only
Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be taken into account when making any
calculations required under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Delivery of information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only. The Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, including


-----

the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or documents
related therein.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company will not, and will procure that no Restricted Subsidiary or Topco will, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect
to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders, and the Company shall not,
and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or Topco to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent,
for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and Topco may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for
the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and Topco
may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents
for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released
in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended
from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the
Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and Topco may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not
adversely affect Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (v) above, the
Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise
modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Company delivers to the Trustee and
the Security Agent, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the
Security Agent from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any relevant action with respect to Security Documents to
which Topco is party as a security grantor, confirming the solvency of Topco), after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the Company or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person,
in form and substance reasonable satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting
such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement. In the event that the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or Topco complies with the requirements
of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other
modification or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions from
any Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit
Facility or any Public Debt, in each case of the Company or a Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or
becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if
applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes
Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with, as applicable, such Restricted
Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be obligated to become a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee is
contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a


-----

Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3)
any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of
pocket expenses. At the option of the Company, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor
liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantee Release.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary_
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of a
Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each
_Series of Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of (i) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or
as otherwise required herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in
paragraph (i) above, the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the
Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives)
an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the
same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests, provided that
(A) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if more than one such intercreditor
agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Company and without
the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or
types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in
right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes); (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or
an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional
Senior Secured Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional
Senior Secured Notes; (vi) facilitate a Permitted Reorganization or Permitted Transaction; (vii) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens; (viii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof; or (ix) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to
ensure that the Senior Secured Notes are secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. In formulating its
decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinions of
Counsel.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that the Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, other than (i) in accordance with the preceding paragraph; or (ii) with the consent of the requisite
majority of Holders except as otherwise permitted under “Amendments and Waivers,” and the Company may


-----

only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does
not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security
Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the requisite majority of Holders to the payment, repayment,
purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the
Senior Secured Notes thereby, provided that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

Each Holder shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into
any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

Any amounts incurred on the basis of any basket, test or permission where an element is set by reference to a
percentage of LTM EBITDA (“EBITDA based basket”) shall (provided that such amounts are, at the time of
incurrence, duly and properly incurred in accordance with the relevant basket, test or permission) be treated as
having been duly and properly incurred without the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default even in the
event that such EBITDA based basket subsequently decreases by virtue of operation of that calculation.

Unless an EBITDA based basket is otherwise specifically provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
any other basket, test or permission set by reference to a fixed amount shall also be deemed to include an
additional EBITDA based basket, if higher, set by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA calculated as an
amount equal to the ratio of such fixed amount to €320.0 million expressed as a percentage.

If on any quarter end date or following the completion of any Permitted Investment under paragraphs (a)(ii) or
(b) of the definition of Permitted Investment or any other acquisition or investment not prohibited by (or
otherwise approved under) the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (a “Permitted Acquisition”),
investment, transaction or capital expenditure (after giving pro forma effect to any adjustments permitted by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) the Consolidated EBITDA increases from the Consolidated EBITDA on the
immediately preceding quarter end date, each fixed euro basket test or permission amount in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture shall be permanently increased by the same percentage as such increase and be reset to that
level.

If (i) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant
to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket and (ii) at a later time would subsequently be
permitted under a ratio-based basket, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter, transaction
or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based basket.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or exceptions set
out in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify and may from time
to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be required to
include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an
amount or transaction may at the option of the Company be split between different baskets or exceptions).

Any reference in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to an Applicable Metric shall be deemed to be a reference
to such Applicable Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date.

In relation to any action, matter or transaction (including an Investment or Permitted Acquisition) which would
result in a cumulative increase to the Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group (in an amount
determined by the Company by reference to the date of commitment thereto after giving pro forma effect thereof
and any adjustments permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) (each a “Qualifying Transaction”), from
such date until the date on which the Quarterly Financial Statements for the first quarter end date falling
immediately after completion (or as the case may be termination or abandonment) of that Qualifying
Transaction are delivered to the Trustee, the Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group for the
purposes of all baskets, fixed amounts, ratios and thresholds in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture which
include a calculation by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA shall be increased (on a pro


-----

forma basis) by such amount. If the value of any of the baskets, fixed amounts, ratios or thresholds is
subsequently decreased upon the delivery of the applicable Quarterly Financial Statements in respect of the
financial quarter immediately following completion (or as the case may be termination or abandonment) of that
Qualifying Transaction, any item undertaken or incurred in good faith prior to any decrease shall be
grandfathered and shall continue to be permitted notwithstanding the subsequent reduction in the relevant
baskets, fixed amounts, ratios or thresholds.

For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year or calendar year (each an “Annual
_Period”) (i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such_
Annual Period may be increased by (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the
permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied
by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal
to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such
immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back
Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with the preceding clause (i), any usage of such basket during such Annual
Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) firstly against any Carry Forward Amount; (B)
secondly against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in
accordance with the preceding clause (i); and (C) thirdly against any Carry Back Amount.

To the extent that any Indebtedness, Lien, distribution, payment or Investment or other transaction referred to in
or contemplated by the definition of Applicable Test Date, satisfies any Applicable Metric, or other test or
condition on the Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric, test or condition shall be deemed to have been
satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence or on any other date of determination under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and irrespective of any facts or circumstances (including financial condition) on any such date
or thereafter.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to amounts incurred or transactions entered into
(or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that does not require
compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any basket with a fixed euro
amount or based on a percentage of LTM EBITDA) (and such amount a “Non-Ratio Basket Amount”) on the
same date as any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including, without limitation, any Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and/or
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) that requires compliance with any such financial ratio or test (any such amount a
“Ratio Based Basket Amount”), it is understood and agreed that the Non-Ratio Basket Amount (and any cash
proceeds thereof and any discharge of any Indebtedness with the proceeds thereof) shall be disregarded in the
calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to such incurrence of any Ratio Based Basket Amount.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Company_**

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and

existing under the laws of England and Wales, France, any member state of the European Union, or the
United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will
expressly assume, by way of Supplemental Indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Company under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and all obligations of the
Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an

obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company
or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is continuing;


-----

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (i) the Company or the applicable Successor

Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph or clause (1)(E) of the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; or (ii) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries would not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio would not be higher,
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an

Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture is a legal and binding agreement
enforceable against the Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(5) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially

equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods) guarantees and security over the
same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the Company or the
Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to exist (provided
_that if the shares (or other interests) in the Company cease to exist, security will be granted (subject to_
the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Company under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a

series of related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) either (i) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes

a Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction; or (ii) either (x) the Company or a
Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly
assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and all
obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and

(B) either (i) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing;

or (ii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_General_**

The provisions set forth in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or

liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Company, a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or a Guarantor;

(2) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to

the Company or another Guarantor;


-----

(3) the Company or any Guarantor from transferring any assets comprising shares or other equity interests

to a Third Party Security Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); provided that to the
extent that any Security Interest was previously granted over such shares or other equity interests and
that Security Interest would not, in accordance with the applicable law, constitute a Lien over the
shares following such transfer, the relevant Third Party Security Provider shall, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, grant Security Interest over the shares or other equity interests transferred in
accordance with this clause (3) on substantially equivalent terms to any security interest previously
granted over such shares or other equity interests as soon as reasonably practicable following the
transfer;

(4) any consolidation or merger of the Company into any Guarantor, provided that, if the Company is not

the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation: (i) the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Company under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1), (4) and (5) of the
covenant described under “—Company” shall apply to such transaction; and (ii) to the extent that any
Security Interest previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant Guarantor would not,
in accordance with the applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital of the surviving
entity, the direct Holding Company of the surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, grant Security Interest over the shares in the capital of the surviving entity on substantially
equivalent terms to any Security Interest granted over the shares in the capital of such predecessor
Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(5) the Company or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate

incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating
such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity, provided that, in the case
of a consolidation, merger or combination of (A) the Company into or with an Affiliate that is not a
Guarantor, clauses (1), (2), (4) and (5) under “—Company” and (B) any Guarantor into or with an
Affiliate, paragraph (4) under “—Guarantor,” as the case may be, shall apply to such transaction; or

(6) any Permitted Transaction.

This covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary. Nothing in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall prohibit, condition or restrict the
Transactions.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note when due and payable, continued for 30

days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note when

due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise continued for five Business Days;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on

behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, other than those set out in clauses (1) or (2) above;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be

issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, Indebtedness under any (I) Hedging Obligations, (II) Subordinated Shareholder Funding and
(III) Ancillary Facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement to the extent that a Revolving Facility is
available for drawing in order to refinance amounts outstanding under such Ancillary Facility) for
money borrowed which is Incurred or Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, other
than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving

effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment default”); or


-----

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross

acceleration provision”),

and, in each case, the aggregate principal outstanding amount of any such Indebtedness, together with
the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of
principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity
of which has been accelerated, is in excess of the greater of (x) €96.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM
EBITDA;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, Topco or a Significant

Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company, a Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in

excess of the greater of (x) €96.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, other than any judgments
covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy
companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than
60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after such judgment
becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has
been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of the greater

of (x) €48.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable
or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is
invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”);
and

(8) except as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any

Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of
any one or more Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more
Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee
(the “guarantee default provisions”).

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than
30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the
Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders
shall, declare the principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes
to be due and payable immediately, and upon such declaration, such principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, will be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that a Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or
(8) of the first paragraph of this section will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of
30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes notify the Company of the Default and
the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clauses after receipt of such notice.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration to accelerate the Senior Secured Notes, such principal and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in the
case of an Event of Default arising under clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Senior
Secured Notes (including the accrued and unpaid interest thereof) will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. A notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take
any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default set forth in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8)
of the first paragraph of this covenant may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly
or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice or instruction. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will
provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default


-----

relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in
their interest.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described
in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness,
or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of
the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Holders may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by
a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with
respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with
another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action
and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though
such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity, security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability
or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may
pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested in

writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security, indemnity

and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request

and the offer of such satisfactory security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given

the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required
in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own


-----

affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that
would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole
discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and
so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year.
The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the
Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Company is duly complying
with its obligations contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture required to be observed and performed by
it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Senior Secured
Notes has occurred.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes); provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other
modification will only affect one series of the Senior Secured Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the
consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to
any such series of the Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the
time at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under
“Optional Redemption” or “Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due
dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under
“Withholding Taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in
any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a
loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any
obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to
pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;


-----

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant
described under the heading “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the release of
less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,

waiver or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which
require the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to receive
payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a Guarantor
under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or
the Holders or make any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any
Senior Secured Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any
material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes
that may be issued in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the
Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior
Secured Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that
such provision in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to be a verbatim
recitation of a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior
Secured Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or the Security
Agent to any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest
in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to
be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the transfer

and legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including
to facilitate the issuance and administration of Senior Secured Notes; provided, however, that (i)
compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior
Secured Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior
Secured Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of “Permitted Reorganization” or (b)

the covenants described under the headings “Merger and Consolidation” and “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of_
assets; or

(12) as provided in “Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, as applicable) shall be entitled
to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, without further inquiry, including
Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured
Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain a
covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Senior
Secured Notes Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith and
obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registrations of Senior Secured Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Company exercises its
legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other
than with respect to the defeasance trust).


-----

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under “Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross
acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Company), the judgment
default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provisions described under “Events of
_Default” above (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes,
payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause
(3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and Consolidation—The Company”), (4), (5) (with respect
only to the Company and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Company), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
trust”) with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as
the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, in

their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must
be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of

defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to

customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes
and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) as to all Senior
Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other
than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision
for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been
delivered to the Trustee or Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at
their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the
expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in
Euros or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured
Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3)
the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (4)
the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption
date, as the case may be; and (5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of


-----

the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to
matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing by
the Company, the Trustee or the Paying Agent may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to
Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have
received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Company of such earlier repayment date (which may be
included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior
to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent that the Senior Secured Notes are
represented by Global Notes deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial
holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable
procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Guarantor under the
Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not
be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are
set forth specifically in such Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights
and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent
Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from
taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it
become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar, the Security Agent and any other agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by
giving written notice to the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of
interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six
months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Company with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes will be sent to the Authority.


-----

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Senior Secured
Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream,
which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
paragraph.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it
is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for
payment thereof. Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Company and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Company, any Guarantor
or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Company
or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of
the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on
the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Senior Secured Note, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient
or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a
Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a
separate and independent obligation from the Company’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to
a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a
Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in
full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any
sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any Eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a nonEuro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such nonEuro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Secured
Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price
and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United
States.

Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Company and the Guarantors will in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in
the City, County and State of New York, in the United States of America. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit,
action or proceeding with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder, and the Notes Guarantees thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Senior Secured Notes

a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
England. The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France and the Grand Duchy of

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Permitted Acquisitions, Investments,

have been made by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, during the Relevant Testing Period or
subsequent to the Relevant Testing Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio Calculation Date shall, at the option of the Company, be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all

disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the

revenue enhancements, capacity or capacity utilisation increases, expense reductions, operating improvements
or other similar or other adjustments or initiatives had been fully achieved on the first day of the Relevant
Testing Period). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated, at the Company’s option, either (x) as if the rate in effect on
the determination date had been the applicable rate for the entire Relevant Testing Period or (y) using the
average rate in effect over the Relevant Testing Period, in each case taking into account any Hedging
Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness. As determined in accordance with the Election Option (as
applicable), interest on a lease (including any Capitalized Lease Obligation) shall be deemed to accrue at an
interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the
rate of interest implicit in such lease in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred
to above or any other computation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, interest on any Indebtedness under a
revolving credit facility or any other Credit Facility available to be redrawn (including the Revolving Facility)

optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if
none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

Indebtedness or, if no such indicative margin exists, as reasonably determined by the Company in good faith.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES**

The following is a description of the €250 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due
2029 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes will be issued by Flamingo Lux II SCA, a partnership limited by
shares organized under the laws of Luxembourg (the “Senior Notes Issuer”). You will find definitions of certain
capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Senior Notes” under the heading “Certain Definitions.” For
purposes of this “Description of the Senior Notes,” references to the “Senior Notes Issuer,” “we,” “our,” and
“us” refer only to Flamingo Lux II SCA and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Senior Notes Issuer will issue the Senior Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about March 25, 2021
(the “Senior Notes _Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined below),_
U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), Elavon Financial Services DAC, as
security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”), and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as paying agent, in
a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Notes
Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions
of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to
the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified
indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of
interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

The Senior Notes Issuer intends to on-lend the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes to the Company.

The Senior Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Senior
Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and
security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking
enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and
guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Senior Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.
Since this description of the terms of the Senior Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Notes,
the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions
of the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and your rights.

The registered Holder of a Senior Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Senior Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Notes have not been, and will not be, registered
under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Notes_**

The Senior Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of the Senior Notes Issuer that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Senior Notes Issuer
and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Notes or that secure
such indebtedness or obligation on a priority basis (including, with respect to the Shared Collateral,
obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations),
to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness;


-----

- be Guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Guarantors;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes
Issuer that are not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

- mature on March 31, 2029; and

- be represented by one or more registered Senior Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may
be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
First-Priority Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes and the Holders will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of Collateral that is not First-Priority Collateral only after any indebtedness with a prior-ranking
Lien on such Collateral is repaid in full, including the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities.

The Senior Notes Issuer is a holding company and the direct parent entity of the Company, owning all the shares
of the Company. It has no revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations
(other than de minimis trade holding company activities, trade payables, taxes payable and provisions for taxes),
material assets (other than the shares it owns in the Company and debt instruments issued by the Company or
certain other indirect subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer) or liabilities (other than those incurred in
connection with the Transactions and the PECs, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Preferred Equity
_Certificates”). Therefore, the Senior Notes Issuer depends on the receipt of funds from its Subsidiaries (whether_
in the form of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or payments with respect to intercompany
obligations) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes will be
structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of the Senior
Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—Designation
_of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants
in the Senior Notes Indenture.

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

The Senior Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by (i) on the Issue Date, the Company, Foncia
Holding and Foncia Groupe (the “Issue Date Guarantors”) and (ii) within 180 days from (and excluding) the
Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees
granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, Foncia Transaction France, Assurimo,
Assurimo Paris and Foncia Lyon (the “Post-Issue Date Guarantors” and together with the Issue Date
Guarantors, the “Guarantors”) on a senior subordinated basis. In addition, if required by the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes
Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.

Once granted, the Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

- be a general senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Guarantor,
including the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of that
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee;

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Notes Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor and its
subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Notes or the Notes


-----

Guarantees or that secure such indebtedness or obligation on a priority basis (including, with respect to
the Shared Collateral, obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain
Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness;
and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that Guarantor
that do not guarantee the Senior Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable
law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Notes Guarantees will be further
limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Notes Guarantees—
_General.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be_
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The
_insolvency laws of France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the_
_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_
_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will issue €250 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Notes. The Senior Notes will mature on March 31, 2029. The Senior Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt,
Euroclear and Clearstream are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum denomination.

**Interest on the Senior Notes**

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at the rate of 5.000% per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes will be
payable semi-annually in arrear on March 31 and September 30, commencing on September 30, 2021. Interest
on the Senior Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Notes on the Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months.

If the Senior Notes Issuer redeems any Global Notes on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before
the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption
date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Senior Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Senior Notes Issuer.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Senior Notes will be
made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by
the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and
Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents. In addition,_
interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, by check
mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See “Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes.”

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Notes to receive payments on the Senior Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any


-----

Senior Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will
not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not
be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Notes (the “Paying Agent”).
The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Senior Notes Issuer will also maintain a
registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar
will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Senior Notes on behalf of the Senior Notes
Issuer.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Senior Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Senior Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Notes.

**Additional Senior Notes**

The Senior Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €250 million aggregate
principal amount Senior Notes will be issued in this offering. The Senior Notes Issuer may issue additional
Senior Notes (the “Additional Senior Notes”) from time to time under the Senior Notes Indenture, subject to
compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Notes Indenture. Any series of Additional Senior Notes
shall have terms substantially identical to the Senior Notes originally issued, except in respect of any of the
following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (defined below) supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Notes shall bear

interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest
rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on
which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record
dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon
which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Notes shall be denominated and the

currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Senior
Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and

conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess

thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Senior Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional

Senior Notes.

Such Additional Senior Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Notes, as a single class for the
purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not
specifically distinguished for such series in such Officer’s Certificate; provided that any Additional Senior
Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of Senior Notes offered hereunder for U.S. federal income
tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification number from such
Senior Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture and this
“Description of the Senior Notes,” references to “Senior Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the
Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Senior Notes. Additional Senior Notes
may be designated to be of the same series as a series of Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only


-----

if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such series of initial Senior Notes, and shall
be deemed to form one series and references to such series of Senior Notes shall be deemed to include the
Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well any such Additional Senior Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

The obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer pursuant to the Senior Notes, including any payment obligation
resulting from a Change of Control Triggering Event, will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior
subordinated basis by the Guarantors (each, a “Notes Guarantee” and together, the “Notes Guarantees”).

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company, the Guarantors and the Pledged Opcos generated 54.3%
of our consolidated EBITDA (and 33.8% excluding Pledged Opcos). As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries
that will not guarantee the Senior Notes had €7.4 million of indebtedness, excluding accrued interest, bank
overdraft and deposits and guarantees received. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Notes
Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Notes Indenture. See “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.”_

In addition, as described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer that guarantee the
Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of the Senior Notes Issuer or a
Guarantor, will also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent
preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar
matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing
to the Holders.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any
comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The insolvency laws of France and the Grand Duchy of_
_Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another_
_jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests,_
_including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_

A portion of the operations of the Senior Notes Issuer are conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected
to become Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors
and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred
stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of nonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders. The Senior Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries (if any).


-----

**_Subordination of the Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantees will be senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Guarantees will rank behind, and will be expressly
subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any obligations
under the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes and any future Indebtedness ranking pari passu therewith.
As a result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full
payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to Holders of the Notes in respect of
such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to
significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For example, the ability of the Trustee or the Holders to take
enforcement action with respect to the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain standstill provisions and
payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the Holders will not be able to enforce
the Note Guarantees until the expiration of the applicable standstill period for so long as amounts under Senior
Indebtedness remain outstanding. In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes and the
Note Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of
the Company pursuant to an enforcement of security over shares of the Company taken by the Security Agent
acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that_
holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of the Guarantors would recover
disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding
relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the
principal of or interest on the Senior Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Notes—Your right to receive payment under the Senior Notes Guarantees_
_is contractually subordinated to senior ranking debt of the Guarantors.”_

**_Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale,
exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture of such Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes in
accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture, as provided in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and
_Discharge,” respectively;_

(4) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(5) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”;_

(7) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under
the Senior Facilities Agreement, provided that such Guarantor also releases its Note Guarantee
under the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(9) as described under “IPO Pushdown”;

(10) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes;


-----

(11) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Senior Notes; or

(12) as a result of a transaction permitted by “Merger and Consolidation.”

Subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture and customary
protections and indemnifications, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, shall take all necessary
actions at the reasonable written request and cost of the Senior Notes Issuer, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected
by the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, without the consent of the Holders and will not require
any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable. Neither the
Trustee, the Security Agent nor the Senior Notes Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Senior Notes
to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or around the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes and the Note
Guarantees thereof will be secured by, on a first-priority basis, an account pledge granted by the Senior Notes
Issuer in respect of its material bank accounts and, on a second-priority basis, a share pledge granted by the
Senior Notes Issuer in respect of shares held by it in the Company and an intercompany receivables pledge
granted by the Senior Notes Issuer in respect of structural intercompany receivables owing to it by the
Company.

The Security Interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of
the Holders pursuant to the Security Documents. The Shared Collateral will also secure on a first-priority basis
the liabilities under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations, and may
also secure certain future Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Interests in the
Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Notes Issuer and the_
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances
of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements
described herein, Additional Senior Notes, as permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the
Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other assets subject
to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Notes, any Notes
Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Security Interests in the
Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity,
the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Notes Indenture will provide that certain property, rights and assets may not be_
pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. For a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed
Security Principles as they apply to the Senior Facilities, and which will apply to the Senior Notes, mutatis
_mutandis, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Senior Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.


-----

Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Senior Notes—The value of the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not_
_be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes and such Senior Notes Collateral may be reduced_
_or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (such security interests, the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the
lenders under the Senior Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, (c) the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Senior Notes Indenture, (d) the trustee and the security
agent with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, and (e) the creditors
of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured
by such Collateral, respectively, are established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides,
among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations, if
any, and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by first-priority security interests in the
Shared Collateral and the Senior Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by second-priority Security
Interest in the Shared Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Notes to
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The circumstances in which the holders of the Senior
Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of the Security Interests over the
Shared Collateral are significantly limited. Generally, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the holders of
first-ranking security interests in the Shared Collateral will be entitled to control virtually all decisions relating
to the exercise of remedies with respect to these security interests, will be able to block enforcement of such
security interests, will be able to release the security interests constituting Shared Collateral in certain
circumstances and will receive any proceeds from the enforcement of those security interests before amounts
will be available to the holders of the Senior Notes.

In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the holders of the Senior
Notes) to take enforcement action under the Security Documents with respect to the Shared Collateral are
subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee
and the holders of the Senior Notes may only act through the Security Agent and will not be able to
independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents or until the expiration of
the applicable standstill period and for so long as any amounts under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior
Secured Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and any such other Senior Indebtedness or obligations remain
outstanding, force a sale of such Shared Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Senior Notes Issuer will grant security over the Collateral to secure the
payment when due of the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior
Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by
the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such
Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties
(including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the counterparties under
certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, only the Security Agent (or, if the collateral represented by the Security Documents is held by a
creditor other than the Security Agent, that creditor) will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on
behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes, except through the
Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture)
provide instructions to the Security Agent (or such creditor) for the Collateral (as applicable). In addition, prior
to the discharge of obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging
Obligations and other obligations constituting priority indebtedness under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
representatives of the Holders, including the Trustee, will be subject to a standstill period on the taking of any


-----

enforcement action over the Shared Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by
Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture
have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes
Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the
validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may
not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each
_Series of Notes—The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of_
_the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods_
_for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee
to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by_
similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral
and the trustee of the Senior Secured Notes have and, by accepting a Senior Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Note, will be deemed
(without any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the

Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor

Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply

with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on
its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—In certain jurisdictions, security
_over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The_
_ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture or (b) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of_
accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a
Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets
remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Senior Notes following such
sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets of, and Capital Stock issued by, such
Guarantor;

(3) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes, as provided in
“Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge,” respectively;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness that
gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “Merger and Consolidation”; provided
_that in such a transaction where the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor ceases to exist, the Lien on_
the Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the Capital Stock of the
successor entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent to the existing Lien
on the Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the
holder of such Capital Stock;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) if the Senior Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property
and assets of, and Capital Stock issued by, such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets
designated by the Senior Notes Issuer as Receivables Assets in connection with a Receivables
Facility;

(9) as described under “IPO Pushdown”; or

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by,
and at the cost of, the Senior Notes Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases
set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the
part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee
shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying
which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that
such release complies with the Senior Notes Indenture.


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons
attached, as follows:

- each series of Senior Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

- each series of Senior Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
_Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the_
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Senior Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000, and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and
any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Notes Indenture. It is expected that
such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Senior Notes Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Senior Notes Indenture will
require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any definitive registered Senior Notes:

(1) For a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Notes;

(2) For a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Notes to be

redeemed in part;


-----

(3) For a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) Which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of

Control Offer of an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,” the Senior Notes Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Notes
Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Senior Notes
are not redeemable at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer.

At any time prior to March 31, 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part,
at its option, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Senior Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to March 31, 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may, at its option, redeem
Senior Notes, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash Proceeds received by
the Senior Notes Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 105.000% of the principal
amount of the Senior Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but excluding, the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40%
of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including any Additional Senior Notes);
_provided that:_

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity

Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including Additional

Senior Notes) issued under the Senior Notes Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

At any time and from time to time on or after March 31, 2024, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to
the percentage of principal amount of the Senior Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Senior Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and Additional
Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the period beginning on March 31, of the year indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2024 ................................................................................................................................................... 102.50000%
2025 ................................................................................................................................................... 101.25000%
2026, and thereafter ........................................................................................................................... 100.00000%

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Senior Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Notes in
such tender offer and the Senior Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior
Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Senior
Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice,
given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Senior Notes of such series, in whole
or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other
Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the


-----

tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding,
the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of the Senior Notes Indenture regarding Senior
Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Senior Notes Issuer or its Affiliates, in
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Senior Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Senior Notes in a tender offer,
including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Senior Notes owned by an Affiliate of the
Senior Notes Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such
determination.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we may
repurchase the Senior Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “Selection and Notice.”

Unless the Senior Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on
the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Senior Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Senior Notes Issuer may be required to
offer to purchase Senior Notes as described under “Change of Control” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Senior Notes are not held
through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method of selection the Senior
Notes will be selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior Note in an unauthorized
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Senior Note of €100,000
in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Notes in integral multiples of
€1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections
made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Notes to be redeemed at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days
prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Notes may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control,
an Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related
transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Senior Notes Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after
the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied
(or waived by the Senior Notes Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived
by the Senior Notes Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or
purchase date as so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Senior Notes Issuer’s sole
discretion if the Senior Notes Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived.
In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase
price and performance of the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be
performed by another Person.


-----

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem Senior Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the
Senior Notes Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made
pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different
provisions will have different redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption
date to the Holder in whose name the Senior Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Senior Notes will be subject to redemption by the Senior Notes Issuer.

If and for so long as any Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the
rules of the Authority so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the
Holders of the Senior Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the
Authority of any change in the principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.

If any Definitive Registered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Definitive Registered Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case
a portion of the original Definitive Registered Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will
be made on such Senior Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior
Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date,
unless the Senior Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on
Senior Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all
Additional Amounts, as defined below under “Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due
on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Senior Notes Issuer determines in
good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated

thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such

laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the
payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Senior Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who
can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be
publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing
provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one
payment on the Senior Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person
becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time
such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture.


-----

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled
to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right
to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the
relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel
of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the relevant taxing jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the effect that the Payor
has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee
will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it
will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Senior Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority`s
interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note or Notes Guarantee is made

or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax

purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Senior Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest
or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional
_Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such_
payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in
respect of such payments on any such Senior Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the
relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in or place of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Senior Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Senior Note, the Senior Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Senior Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor
addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the


-----

Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each
case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Note for
payment (where Senior Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect
to the Senior Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a
Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant
Senior Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the
European Union;

(7) any Taxes imposed to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor (including, without limitation, being a shareholder of the Senior Notes Issuer
or any Guarantor) other than the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Note or the receipt
of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Note, the Senior Notes
Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(8) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through
1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof
or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(9) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under Section 3406 of the Code; or

(10) any combination of the items (1) through (9) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled
to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Notes
directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent).
Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Note or
any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and
the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s
Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely
solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.


-----

Wherever in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes or this “Description of the Senior Notes” there is
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and (where applicable) reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from
the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Senior
Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Senior Notes Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Notes after this offering and, solely to the
extent of such Taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or
interest on the Senior Notes, any such Taxes or similar charges or levies that would have been excluded under
clauses (1) through (10) (other than clause (4)) above).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture,
any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Notes
(or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third
party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior
Notes as described under “Optional Redemption,” the Senior Notes Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of
the Senior Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof;
_provided_ _that Senior Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in_
part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior
Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to
the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Notes
for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer
made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Senior Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action
letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the
event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Notes Indenture
does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem
the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event
may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities lenders to
accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control
or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of
Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require
the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if
the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of
such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer.

The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase
feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of
us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature
is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Senior Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change
of Control Triggering Event under the Senior Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on
our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in_
the Senior Notes Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the
Senior Notes Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the
event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been given
pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a
default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not
consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be
satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior
Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Senior Notes
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control
Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or
modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Authority so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control
Offer.


-----

**IPO Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide (and the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Senior
Notes Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent)
that the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as
described in “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—Provisions
_following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required (at the expense of the Senior Notes_
Issuer) to enter into any amendment to the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Security Documents required by the Senior Notes Issuer and/or
take such other action as is required by the Senior Notes Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by this paragraph. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—There are
_circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_
_Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the_
_Security Agent obtaining your further consent.”_

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Senior Notes Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that (x) the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and (y) no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Notes Indenture, then, beginning on that day and
continuing until the Reversion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to the following covenants (the “Suspended Covenants”):

- “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

- “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

- “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

- “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

- “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

- _“—Additional Guarantees”;_

- _“—Impairment of Security Interest”; and_

- provisions of clause (3)(i) of the first paragraph under “Merger and Consolidation—Senior Notes Issuer.”

If at any time the Senior Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and will be
applicable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture (including in connection with performing any
calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture), unless and
until the Senior Notes subsequently attains Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants
shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided
_that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Senior Notes_
Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken
or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been
permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time
between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension
_Period.”_


-----

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(A) of the second paragraph
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted
Liens pursuant to paragraph (k) of such definition.

Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” above had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension_
Period and accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during
any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.”

Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to take any
action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension_
Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.”

On and after each Reversion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to
consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as
such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

Any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant
Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Senior Notes Issuer will not issue Disqualified Stock
and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock, provided _that the Senior Notes_
Issuer and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the
Senior Notes Issuer may issue Disqualified Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred
Stock, if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application
of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is at least 2.00:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Indebtedness”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under
any Credit Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the
sum of:

(A) the aggregate of:

(i) an amount equal to the principal amount of the Senior Term Loan as of the Issue Date; plus

(ii) an amount equal to the greater of (x) €437.5 million and (y) 137.0% of LTM EBITDA; plus

(B) an amount equal to the greater of (x) €320.0 million and (y) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA; plus

(C) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement secured by
a Permitted Collateral Lien (“Secured Indebtedness”) such that, on the date of determination,
after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (including pro forma application of the proceeds


-----

thereof), (I) the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 5.90:1.00, or (II) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00:1.00 (in each case with
any Indebtedness Incurred under paragraph (B) above on the date of determination of the
Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not being
included in the calculation of Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio under this paragraph (C) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date);
_plus_

(D) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Secured Indebtedness, such that, on the date of
determination, on a pro forma basis for such Incurrence (including pro forma application of the
proceeds thereof), (I) the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 6.40:1.00, or (II) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00:1.00 (in each case with
any Indebtedness Incurred under paragraph (B) above on the date of determination of the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not being included
in the calculation of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
under this paragraph (D) on such date of determination but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date),

_provided that in each case any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness_
Incurred or deemed to be Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (1) may at any time without restriction,
condition or use of other permission (A) be refinanced at any time if the principal amount of the
Indebtedness Incurred in the refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (1) on the date of
determination for such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness or
unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an
amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any
premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred (including tender premiums), penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid
interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other fees, costs
and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees, or similar fees in respect of the
Indebtedness Incurred to effect such refinancing) Incurred or payable in connection with such
refinancing); and (B) to the extent of any voluntary prepayment, buyback or cancellation of any
facility relating thereto shall (without double counting) be permitted to be incurred at any later time
up to such amount prepaid, bought back or cancelled;

(2) any (A) Guarantees by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and (B) without limiting the
covenant under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or
applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations is not
prohibited by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any
other event which results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the
Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer; and (B) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer, shall be deemed in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of
such Indebtedness by the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by:

(A) Indebtedness of the Group outstanding as of the Issue Date or Incurred under a facility
committed or available for utilization and as in effect as of the Issue Date;

(B) any of:


-----

(i) the Senior Notes outstanding on the Issue Date;

(ii) the Senior Secured Notes outstanding on the Issue Date;

(iii) any loans pursuant to which the proceeds of any Topco Notes are lent to the Senior Notes

Issuer, to the extent that Topco Notes are guaranteed by one or more members of the Group
and such guarantees are permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture,

in each case after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the application of the
proceeds therefrom;

(E) “parallel debt” obligations under any Senior Note Document;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Person that will be a
Restricted Subsidiary or that will be merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, Incurred or issued to finance an acquisition
(including an acquisition of any assets), Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation
or capital expenditure or other or similar transaction or (y) of Persons that are, or secured by any
assets that are, acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into,
amalgamated or consolidated with the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture or (z) any Acquired Indebtedness; in an aggregate
principal amount outstanding not to exceed:

(A) the greater of (I) €80.0 million and (II) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA at the applicable time, when

taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness pursuant to this paragraph (5)(A); plus

(B) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving effect to such acquisition,

Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or capital expenditure or other or
similar transaction and without giving effect to any Indebtedness Incurred or issued pursuant to
paragraph (A) above on the Applicable Test Date, either:

(i) if such Indebtedness is not Secured Indebtedness, the Senior Notes Issuer would be permitted

to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant or clause (1)(D) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or if such Indebtedness is
Secured Indebtedness, the Senior Notes Issuer would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of
additional Secured Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or clause

(ii) (I) if such Indebtedness is not Secured Indebtedness, either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower, or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be higher, or (II) if such Indebtedness is Secured Indebtedness, either
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries
would not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Senior
Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be higher, in each case, than it was
immediately prior to such acquisition, Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or capital expenditure or other or similar transaction; plus

(C) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that such Indebtedness is discharged within six

months of the Incurrence or, as applicable, assumption by the Senior Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries or would otherwise constitute Indebtedness not prohibited by this
covenant;


-----

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes as
determined in good faith by the Senior Notes Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness: (A) represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase

installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment, whether through the direct
purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness
which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness and is: (1) Incurred in the ordinary course of
business; or is a Capitalized Lease Obligation or other financing that was treated as an operating lease
prior to the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases) or (2) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount
which, when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal
amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7)(A)(2) and then outstanding, does

guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and
warranties provided by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities,

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories of Permitted Indebtedness or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time
reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and will only be required to include, in any manner that
complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph of this covenant or one of the clauses of
the second paragraph, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by
reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such
provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to the second paragraph of this covenant (other than clauses (1)(C) and (1)(D) of the
second paragraph of this covenant), if at any time that the Senior Notes Issuer would be entitled to
have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph or clauses
(1)(C) and (1)(D) of the second paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall (unless
otherwise elected by the Senior Notes Issuer) be automatically reclassified into an item of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph or clauses (1)(C) and (1)(D) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, as applicable; provided that all Indebtedness under the Senior Term Loan
outstanding on the Issue Date (and any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof) shall be deemed to have
been Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(A)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Senior
Notes Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;


-----

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or
“clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this
covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date
of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums (including tender premiums), penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued
and unpaid interest, and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and
other costs, fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees in
respect of such Refinancing Indebtedness) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or the
second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium)
or the liquidation preference thereof;

(8) in the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases
commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue
Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to paragraph (cc) of the definition of “Permitted
Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior Notes Indenture,
including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or usage of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any) for borrowings
and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s option, either at the Applicable Test Date
or: (A) be determined (i) on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in
commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, a
portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (in each case, pursuant to any letter, agreement or instrument, which may be
conditional, including as to documentation) and/or (ii) on the date on which such facility or
commitments become available (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Senior
Notes Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior Notes
Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and
the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted
under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or
other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or
issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this paragraph (A) shall be (in each case,
solely to the extent that such committed amount, when borrowed or reborrowed, would constitute
Indebtedness) the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, LTM EBITDA or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of any clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such subparagraphs); or (B) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed or utilized pursuant to any


-----

such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Senior Notes Issuer may revoke such
determination and/or make an alternate determination at any time and from time to time;

(9) (without prejudice to any other permitted basis as elected by the Senior Notes Issuer for calculating
the conditions set out below otherwise permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture) in the event that the
Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (w) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an acquisition
(including an acquisition of assets), Investment, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
capital expenditure or other or similar transaction, (x) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are, or
secured by assets that are, acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged
into, amalgamated or consolidated with, the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, (y) commits to an acquisition or transaction
pursuant to which it may Incur Acquired Indebtedness or (z) is subject to a Change of Control or a
Permitted Change of Control, the date of determination of LTM EBITDA, the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, be the Applicable Test
Date or: (A) any date that a commitment, letter or agreement, put option or similar arrangement
(conditional or otherwise (including any documentation condition)) for such acquisition, transaction,
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control is entered
into and the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated
giving pro forma effect to such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, Change
of Control or Permitted Change of Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with
the definition of the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured
Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for the
avoidance of doubt: (i) if any such ratios or covenant baskets are exceeded as a result of fluctuations
in such ratio or covenant baskets (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated EBITDA of the
Senior Notes Issuer or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction, such ratios or covenant baskets will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of
such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction and any related
transactions are permitted hereunder; and (ii) such ratios or covenant baskets shall not be tested at the
time of consummation of such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, Change
of Control or Permitted Change of Control; provided that if the Senior Notes Issuer elects to have
such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, put option or similar
arrangement, (I) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreement, put option or similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for
purposes of calculating any ratios under the Senior Notes Indenture after the date of such agreement
and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is
terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and (II) to the extent any covenant
baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the
earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction or the date such agreement is
terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction but any
calculation of LTM EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not
reflect such acquisition until it has been consummated, unless such other Incurrence of Indebtedness
or Liens is conditional or contingent on the occurrence of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, Change of Control, Permitted Change of Control or other transaction; or (B) the date
such Indebtedness is borrowed or assumed or such Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control
occurs;

(10) in the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary is subject to a Permitted Change of

Control, the calculation of LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or any component thereof
(each an “Applicable Definition”) for the purposes of, at the election of the Senior Notes Issuer: (x)
the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event; (y) the Incurrence of any Indebtedness in
connection with a Permitted Change of Control; and (z) the making of any Restricted Payment in
connection therewith may be (without prejudice to any other permitted basis as elected by the Senior


-----

Notes Issuer for calculating the conditions in paragraph (x) to (z) above otherwise permitted by the
Senior Notes Indenture): (A) by reference to, at the election of the Senior Notes Issuer, either: (I) if
no financial statements have yet been delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Reports”, the
Issue Date, with such Applicable Metric determined by reference to the financial information set out
in this Offering Memorandum; (II) the most recent quarter end date for which financial statements
have been delivered to the Trustee as set forth under “—Reports”, with such Applicable Definition
determined by reference to such financial statements; or (III) the last date of the most recently
completed Relevant Period for which the Group has sufficient available information to be able to
determine such Applicable Metric (with such Applicable Metric determined by reference to such
available information) on or prior to (1) any time of any commitment, letter or agreement (conditional
or otherwise (including any documentation condition)) to enter into the relevant transaction which
would on consummation result in a Permitted Change of Control; or (2) the date upon which the
Permitted Change of Control occurs (the “Applicable Test Parameters”); and (B) pro forma for any
Indebtedness expected to be repaid on or prior to the completion date of the Permitted Change of
Control, and any reduction in such ratio after giving pro forma effect to the use of proceeds arising in
connection with the Permitted Change of Control (including any shareholder injection, or increase to
balance sheet cash received by the Group) and after giving pro forma effect to synergies and cost
savings arising from or relating to the Permitted Change of Control, and to the extent satisfied by
reference to the Applicable Test Parameters, such condition shall be deemed to be satisfied even if
such condition is not satisfied on any subsequent date or by reference to any other applicable test
parameters whether as a result of fluctuations in any basket, ratio or exchange rate after such date
without prejudice to the right of the Senior Notes Issuer to select any other Applicable Test
Parameters from time to time;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to

refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph or any clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant above measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the
applicable date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing,
such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs,
indemnities, discounts, penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any
related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other costs, fees and expenses
(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable and fees in
connection with such refinancing;

(12) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the

principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of IFRS and in the case of any other Indebtedness, with the principal amount or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(13) If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is

committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is
undertaken, in reliance on a ratio-based basket including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, such
ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the commitment or Incurrence of any Indebtedness under
any revolving facility or letter of credit facility or any other Credit Facility available to be redrawn
(including under any Revolving Facility or Ancillary Facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement).

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this covenant and
_provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in_
the Senior Notes Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized
interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness
and such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket,
permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.


-----

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred
or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken, in reliance on a ratio-based
basket including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, and such ratio-based basket is a “no worse than test”, (including clause
(5)(B)(ii) of the second paragraph of this covenant), at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, the applicable
amount of indebtedness for each such financial ratio shall be increased pro forma and prior to the application of
such test calculated as if all Permitted Indebtedness had been drawn in full (including clause (1)(B) of the
second paragraph of this covenant).

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant the Senior Notes Issuer shall be in default of this
covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s option, the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred, provided _that notwithstanding anything in the Senior_
Notes Indenture, for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Senior Notes Issuer may elect
to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness, and further provided that if
such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) penalties, interest
or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or
similar fees and other fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being
refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitted such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that: (x) any net proceeds from such Indebtedness are
contributed to the equity of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form
or otherwise received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (y) any net
proceeds described in the preceding sub-clause (x) shall be excluded for purposes of
increasing the amount available for distribution pursuant to clause (b) of this first paragraph of
this covenant and shall not be Excluded Contributions or Excluded Amounts; and (z) in the
case that any net proceeds described in the preceding sub-clause (x) are contributed to or
received by the Senior Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries in the form of Indebtedness,
there shall be no double-counting of interest paid on such Indebtedness and any dividends or
distributions payable to the relevant Parent Entity to fund interest payments in respect of
Indebtedness of such Parent Entity;

(2) purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Capital Stock of the

Permitted Payments described in the preceding paragraph and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph
of this covenant and/or (iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to
classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case, portion thereof) on the date of its payment or
later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or, in each case, portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including in each
case as an Investment pursuant to one or more of the paragraphs of the definition of “Permitted Investments”
and may aggregate capacity in multiple paragraphs of the definition of “Permitted Payments” above, the first
paragraph of this covenant and/or in the definition of “Permitted Investments” in any manner that complies with
this covenant. With respect to the making of any distribution or other payment contemplated in this covenant
including any Restricted Payment and any Investment, compliances with any condition of this covenant shall be
determined (at the election of the Senior Notes Issuer) (i) on the date on which such distribution or payment is
paid (ii) the date on which such distribution or payment is declared or committed to be paid (conditionally or

shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other
than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Senior Notes Issuer acting in good faith.


-----

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries
in a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise
acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the Senior Notes
Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and
to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect”
action by the Senior Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and the Senior Notes Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including
Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or
acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any
Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (i) in the case of any property or asset that does not
constitute Collateral (A) Permitted Liens; or (B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if
obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior or senior to,
in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, or junior to, in the case of Liens in respect of
Senior Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured; and (ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of
the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release
and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities), (b)
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other agreement

connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as
consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction
or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into
the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in
connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of

Company;

contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the Senior

purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted

_provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Senior_
Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights
arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the
Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted
Subsidiary; or (D) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests
set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted

-----

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any
such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken
as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Facilities, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, together with the security documents associated therewith, the
Senior Notes Indenture, together with the Security Documents, or the indenture governing any Topco
Notes, together with any security document associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Senior Notes Issuer) and where, in the case of this subclause (ii), either (x) the Senior Notes Issuer determines at the time of entry into such agreement or
instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect,
the Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior Notes or (y)
such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such
agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14)
of this paragraph or this clause (15); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Senior
Notes Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration

(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined
on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the
Senior Notes Issuer, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset

Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap or relates to Non-Core Assets), with a purchase price in excess
of the greater of (x) €48.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration
from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Senior Notes Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalent Investments or
Temporary Cash Investments, provided that this clause (2) shall not apply to the first amount of
consideration from such Asset Dispositions per fiscal year not to exceed the greater of (x) €48.0 million
and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is

required by the terms of any Indebtedness) to prepay, repay or purchase any Permitted
Indebtedness (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary), including the Senior Notes, or any Senior Indebtedness, any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, any Refinancing Indebtedness, or any other Indebtedness under any Credit Facility
Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(A) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Indebtedness secured by a Lien on property or assets of the_


-----

Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Permitted Collateral Liens) within 450
days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash, provided that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will
retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount
equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased, provided further that to the extent
the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any
amount of Senior Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has extended such offer to the
Holders of the Senior Notes on at least a pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in respect of such
Senior Indebtedness (including any Holders of Senior Notes) elect not to tender their Senior
Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed
to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this
clause (a), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds;

(b) to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to

invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Senior Notes
Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that a binding agreement or
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of
such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will
be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable
_Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for_
any reason before the Net Available Cash are applied in connection therewith, the Senior Notes
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second
_Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination;_ _provided further that if any_
Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied,
then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided that (i) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) above, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries
may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture; (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may
elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given
Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of execution
of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset
Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with
paragraph (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition; and (iii) notwithstanding any term of this
paragraph, to the extent that (I) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset
Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Senior Notes Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent
necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including
financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant
directors, AIFMD and any other law or by any organizational documents or any agreement) or (II) a
distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the
Senior Notes Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this
covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Senior Notes Issuer
in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be
applied in compliance with this paragraph.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to
be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”
under the Senior Notes Indenture, provided that, if at the date of any definitive agreement, put option or similar
arrangement in respect of any Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer) the date on which
Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition is received, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio
of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is (a) greater than 5.40:1.00 (b) less than or equal to
5.40:1.00 but greater than 4.90:1.00 or (c) less than or equal to 4.90:1.00, then, in the case of paragraph (a), 0%
of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition, or, in the case of paragraph (b), 50% of the Net
Available Cash from such Asset Disposition, or, in the case of paragraph (c), 100% of the of the Net Available
Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed not to constitute Excess Proceeds and may be used by the
Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Notes
Indenture.


-----

On the 451st day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant or such later date as set
forth in clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant, or such earlier date as the Senior Notes Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiaries may elect) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Senior Notes Indenture exceeds the greater of €80.0
million and 25% of LTM EBITDA in a single transaction, the Senior Notes Issuer will within ten Business Days
be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders under the Senior Notes Indenture and, to
the extent the Senior Notes Issuer elects, to all holders of any other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to,
respectively: (i) repay the Senior Notes (and only to the extent any Senior Notes are outstanding) at par; and (ii)
repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which
the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an
offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the Senior Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that if such Excess Proceeds are required to be
offered first to the lenders of the Senior Term Loan, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the holders of
any other Senior Indebtedness under the terms thereof, the Senior Notes Issuer shall only be required to make an
Asset Disposition Offer following the closing of the offer period in relation to the Senior Term Loan, the Senior
Secured Notes or such other Senior Indebtedness.

The Senior Notes Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail,
with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the
Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier
than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Senior Notes Issuer may satisfy the
foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset
Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such
longer period as provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by
the Senior Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the
Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of
the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that the Senior
Notes Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an
unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Senior Notes Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer
using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon
consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be
deemed Excess Proceeds and the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use such Net Available
Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is denominated in a
currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in Euro that is actually received by the Senior Notes Issuer upon converting such portion into
Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the

Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary

from the transferee that are converted (or reasonably expected to be converted) by the Senior Notes


-----

Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalent Investments within 180 days
following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such

Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Senior Notes Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than Subordinated

Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted

Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all
other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during the same fiscal
year, not to exceed the greater of (x) €80.0 million and (y) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) (with unused amounts in any fiscal year
being carried forward to the next succeeding fiscal year and amounts that will not be used in the
subsequent fiscal year being carried back to the immediately preceding fiscal year);

(6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and

(7) any combination of the consideration specified in paragraphs (1) to (6) above.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Senior
Notes Indenture relative to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes
as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding.

Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Senior Notes Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or
limit, the Senior Notes Issuer from purchasing any Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the
Senior Notes Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer could seek the
consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If the Senior Notes Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it
will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes under such instruments.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or
the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer (any such transaction or series of
related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x)
€32.0 million and (y) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be
obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the
agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an
Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x)
€48.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer,
_provided that any Affiliate Transaction shall also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set_
forth in this clause (2) if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested
Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer, if any.


-----

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” above or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or

program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Senior Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, longterm incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans, transaction bonuses or
transaction related securities repurchase plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or

directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer, in each case
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any: (A) transaction between or among the Senior Notes Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or
entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries; and (B) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity,
_provided that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than_
cash, Cash Equivalent Investments and the Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer and such
merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the
Senior Notes Issuer, any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly
and including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors,
consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for

more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or related assets in
connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer or
the senior management of the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on
terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer or an Associate or similar entity
which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely: (A) because the Senior Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any
Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in, or otherwise controls such Affiliate,
Associate or similar entity; or (B) due to the fact that a director of such Person is also a director of
the Senior Notes Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Senior Notes Issuer (provided
_that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Senior Notes Issuer or such direct or_


-----

indirect Parent Entity of the Senior Notes Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter involving such
other Person);

(10) any: (A) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred

capital of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (B) amendment, waiver or other

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Permitted Holder
in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

(13) the Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting and

(taken as a whole) in any material respect as determined in good faith by the Senior Notes Issuer;

(16) any purchases by the Senior Notes Issuer’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the
Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or

Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the management of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with a Change of Control or Permitted Change of Control.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Senior Notes Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a
Default.

If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary: (i) the aggregate fair market value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the
designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” above or under one or more paragraphs of the definition of
Permitted Payments or Permitted Investments, as determined by the Senior Notes Issuer; (ii) that designation
will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and (iii) that designation must be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies the
preceding paragraph and this paragraph and was permitted by the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments.”_

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements set out in the preceding
paragraph as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of
the Senior Notes Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date
under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Senior Notes Issuer will be in default
of such covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation (i) will be deemed to be
an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary; (ii) will only be permitted if (A) the Indebtedness described in sub-clause (i) is permitted under the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (5) of the second
paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro
forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the Applicable Test Date; and (B) no Event of Default would
be in existence immediately following such designation; and (iii) must be evidenced to the Trustee on the date
of such designation, by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies
with this paragraph.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, the Senior Notes Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following
reports following the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, 150 days) after the end of

each subsequent fiscal year of the Company, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021,
annual reports (the “Annual Financial Statements”) containing: (i) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income

appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years and the

the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results
of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company; (iii)
unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates
(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
below); provided _that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent_


-----

available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in the case
of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of
all material debt instruments; provided that the information described in clause (iv) may be provided in
the footnotes to the audited financial statements; and (v) a summary description of any material
differences in the information reported by the Company with respect to items (i) to (iii) above and the
corresponding information of the Senior Notes Issuer (which summary description need not be audited
and will not include a line-item by line-item reconciliation between financial information of the Senior
Notes Issuer and the corresponding financial information of the Company);

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021, 90 days) following the end

of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company beginning with the fiscal
quarter ending March 31, 2021, quarterly year-to-date financial statements (the “Quarterly Financial
_Statements”) containing the following information: (i) the Company’s unaudited condensed_
consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income
and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii)
unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates;
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available_
without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the
unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company; and (iv) a
summary description of any material differences in the information reported by the Company with
respect to items (i) to (iii) above and the corresponding information of the Senior Notes Issuer (which
summary description need not be audited and will not include a line-item by line-item reconciliation
between financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer and the corresponding financial information
of the Company); and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company or the Senior Notes Issuer

announces publicly or any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is
material to the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a
senior executive officer of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Company or a change in auditors of the Senior
Notes Issuer or the Company, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for
so long as the Senior Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by Persons who are not
“affiliates” under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture) shall
be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise
on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may
otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and
(3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods.
No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type
included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain
any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Senior Notes Issuer’s LTM EBITDA
(calculated (i) in the case of an acquisition, including any pro forma adjustments in respect of such acquisition
and (ii) in the case of a disposal, excluding any pro forma adjustments in respect of such disposal) for the most
recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant


-----

Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer, then the Annual Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Statements
will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior
Notes Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Senior Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee
reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer) the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Senior Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Senior Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of Euronext, the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, the Stockholm Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the
Swiss Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, any recognized investment exchange (as that term is
used in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) or any other exchange or market in any jurisdiction or
country) (each a “Regulated Market”) and the Senior Notes Issuer or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject
to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on a
Regulated Market, for so long as it elects, the Senior Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual
reports, information, documents and other reports that the Senior Notes Issuer, such Parent Entity or such IPO
Entity is, or would be, required to file with the applicable Regulated Market pursuant to such admission and
disclosure standards. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements
require the Senior Notes Issuer, any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the applicable Regulated Market, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Senior Notes Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Senior Notes
Issuer so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including
as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Senior Notes Issuer therein were
references to such Parent Entity and (b) are accompanied by condensed consolidated financial information
together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a
combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of any applicable Parent Entity that are not the Company or
Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated
amounts, none of which shall be required to be audited. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the
Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.
For the avoidance of doubt, only Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be
taken into account when making any calculations required under the Senior Notes Indenture.

Delivery of information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only. The Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, including
the Senior Notes Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Senior Notes Indenture or documents
related therein.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will procure that no Restricted Subsidiary will, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect
to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders, and the Senior Notes Issuer
shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent,


-----

for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for
the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents
for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released
in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended
from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the
Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does
not adversely affect Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (v) above, the
Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise
modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior Notes Issuer delivers to the
Trustee and the Security Agent, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the Senior
Notes Issuer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonable satisfactory to
the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security
Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
(subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to any amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement requested in accordance with this
covenant without the need for instructions from any Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit
Facility or any Public Debt, in each case of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor, unless such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred
and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form
attached to the Senior Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes
Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be subordinated to (in the case such Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness constitutes Senior Indebtedness), pari passu with (in the case such Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness constitutes Pari Passu Indebtedness) or senior to (in the case such Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness constitutes Subordinated Indebtedness), as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of
such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become a
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed
Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules,
guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable
jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is
a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of
the Senior Notes Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantee Release.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary_


-----

actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Senior Notes Issuer to effectuate any
release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each
_Series of Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Senior Notes Issuer, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of (i) any Indebtedness secured on
Collateral or as otherwise required herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness
referred to in paragraph (i) above, the Senior Notes Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and,
if applicable, the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security
Interests, provided that (A) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations
on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable,
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior
Notes Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if more than
one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor
agreements must not conflict.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Senior Notes Issuer and without
the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or
types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes); (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the Senior Notes (including Additional
Senior Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior
Notes; (vi) facilitate a Permitted Reorganization or Permitted Transaction; (vii) implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens; (viii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof; or (ix) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely
affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the
Senior Notes are secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. In formulating its decisions on such matters,
the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinions of Counsel.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that the Senior Notes Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, other than (i) in accordance with the preceding paragraph; or (ii) with the consent of the requisite
majority of Holders except as otherwise permitted under “Amendments and Waivers,” and the Senior Notes
Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable
opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities
under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security
Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the requisite majority of Holders to the payment, repayment,
purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the


-----

Senior Notes thereby, provided that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments.”_

Each Holder shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into
any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

Any amounts incurred on the basis of any basket, test or permission where an element is set by reference to a
percentage of LTM EBITDA (“EBITDA based basket”) shall (provided that such amounts are, at the time of
incurrence, duly and properly incurred in accordance with the relevant basket, test or permission) be treated as
having been duly and properly incurred without the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default even in the
event that such EBITDA based basket subsequently decreases by virtue of operation of that calculation.

Unless an EBITDA based basket is otherwise specifically provided for in the Senior Notes Indenture, any other
basket, test or permission set by reference to a fixed amount shall also be deemed to include an additional
EBITDA based basket, if higher, set by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA calculated as an amount
equal to the ratio of such fixed amount to €320.0 million expressed as a percentage.

If on any quarter end date or following the completion of any Permitted Investment under paragraphs (a)(ii) or
(b) of the definition of Permitted Investment or any other acquisition or investment not prohibited by (or
otherwise approved under) the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture (a “Permitted Acquisition”), investment,
transaction or capital expenditure (after giving pro forma effect to any adjustments permitted by the Senior
Notes Indenture) the Consolidated EBITDA increases from the Consolidated EBITDA on the immediately
preceding quarter end date, each fixed euro basket test or permission amount in the Senior Notes Indenture shall
be permanently increased by the same percentage as such increase and be reset to that level.

If (i) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant
to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket and (ii) at a later time would subsequently be
permitted under a ratio-based basket, unless otherwise elected by the Senior Notes Issuer, such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based basket.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or exceptions set
out in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify and may from time
to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be required to
include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an
amount or transaction may at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer be split between different baskets or
exceptions).

Any reference in the Senior Notes Indenture to an Applicable Metric shall be deemed to be a reference to such
Applicable Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date.

In relation to any action, matter or transaction (including an Investment or Permitted Acquisition) which would
result in a cumulative increase to the Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group (in an amount
determined by the Senior Notes Issuer by reference to the date of commitment thereto after giving pro forma
effect thereof and any adjustments permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture) (each a “Qualifying Transaction”),
from such date until the date on which the Quarterly Financial Statements for the first quarter end date falling
immediately after completion (or as the case may be termination or abandonment) of that Qualifying
Transaction are delivered to the Trustee, the Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group for the
purposes of all baskets, fixed amounts, ratios and thresholds in the Senior Notes Indenture which include a
calculation by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA shall be increased (on a pro forma basis) by
such amount. If the value of any of the baskets, fixed amounts, ratios or thresholds is subsequently decreased
upon the delivery of the applicable Quarterly Financial Statements in respect of the financial quarter
immediately following completion (or as the case may be termination or abandonment) of that Qualifying
Transaction, any item undertaken or incurred in good faith prior to any decrease shall be grandfathered and shall
continue to be permitted notwithstanding the subsequent reduction in the relevant baskets, fixed amounts, ratios
or thresholds.


-----

For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year or calendar year (each an “Annual
_Period”) (i) at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket_
during such Annual Period may be increased by (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive)
between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used
or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an
amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted
amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the
“Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during
such Annual Period is increased in accordance with the preceding clause (i), any usage of such basket during
such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) firstly against any Carry Forward
Amount; (B) secondly against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any
increase in accordance with the preceding clause (i); and (C) thirdly against any Carry Back Amount.

To the extent that any Indebtedness, Lien, distribution, payment or Investment or other transaction referred to in
or contemplated by the definition of Applicable Test Date, satisfies any Applicable Metric, or other test or
condition on the Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric, test or condition shall be deemed to have been
satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence or on any other date of determination under the Senior Notes
Indenture and irrespective of any facts or circumstances (including financial condition) on any such date or
thereafter.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to amounts incurred or transactions entered into
(or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Senior Notes Indenture that does not require compliance with
a financial ratio or test (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any basket with a fixed euro amount or based on a
percentage of LTM EBITDA) (and such amount a “Non-Ratio Basket Amount”) on the same date as any
amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Senior Notes
Indenture (including, without limitation, any Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) that requires compliance with any such financial
ratio or test (any such amount a “Ratio Based Basket Amount”), it is understood and agreed that the Non-Ratio
Basket Amount (and any cash proceeds thereof and any discharge of any Indebtedness with the proceeds
thereof) shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to such incurrence of any
Ratio Based Basket Amount.

**_Limitation on Layered Debt_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any
Indebtedness that is or purports by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) to
be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer unless
such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes on substantially
identical terms.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor will, incur, create, issue, assume,
guarantee or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness that is or purports by its terms (or by the terms of
any agreement governing such Indebtedness) to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to Senior
Indebtedness of such Guarantor and senior in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. No such
Indebtedness will be considered to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness
of any Guarantor by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by
virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of
Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Senior Notes Issuer_**

The Senior Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Senior Notes Issuer”) will be a Person

organized and existing under the laws of England and Wales, France, any member state of the
European Union, or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of
Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Senior Notes


-----

Issuer (if not the Senior Notes Issuer) will expressly assume, by way of Supplemental Indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior
Notes Indenture and all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an

obligation of the applicable Successor Senior Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary of the applicable
Successor Senior Notes Issuer as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable
Successor Senior Notes Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has
occurred and is continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (i) the Senior Notes Issuer or the applicable

Successor Senior Notes Issuer would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph or clause (1)(D) of the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”; or (ii) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Notes Issuer_
and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio
would not be higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) the Senior Notes Issuer or the Successor Senior Notes Issuer, as the case may be, shall have delivered

to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with the Senior Notes
Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture is a legal and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Senior Notes Issuer, provided that in giving an
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(5) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially

equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods) guarantees and security over the
same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the Senior Notes
Issuer or the Successor Senior Notes Issuer, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests)
cease to exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Senior Notes Issuer cease to exist,
security will be granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests)
in the Successor Senior Notes Issuer).

The Successor Senior Notes Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a

series of related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) either (i) the other Person is the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor

or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction; or (ii) either (x) the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture
and all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and

(B) either (i) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing;

or (ii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture.


-----

**_General_**

The provisions set forth in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with,

merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the
Senior Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Senior Notes Issuer
or a Guarantor;

(2) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to

the Senior Notes Issuer or another Guarantor;

(3) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor from transferring any assets comprising shares or other equity

interests to a Third Party Security Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); provided that to
the extent that any Security Interest was previously granted over such shares or other equity interests
and that Security Interest would not, in accordance with the applicable law, constitute a Lien over the
shares following such transfer, the relevant Third Party Security Provider shall, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, grant Security Interest over the shares or other equity interests transferred in
accordance with this clause (3) on substantially equivalent terms to any security interest previously
granted over such shares or other equity interests as soon as reasonably practicable following the
transfer;

(4) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Notes Issuer into any Guarantor, provided that, if the Senior

Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation: (i) the relevant Guarantor will
assume the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1), (4)
and (5) of the covenant described under “—Senior Notes Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and
(ii) to the extent that any Security Interest previously granted over the shares in the capital of the
relevant Guarantor would not, in accordance with the applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares
in the capital of the surviving entity, the direct Holding Senior Notes Issuer of the surviving entity
shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, grant Security Interest over the shares in the capital of
the surviving entity on substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interest granted over the shares in
the capital of such predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(5) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate

incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating
such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity, provided that, in the case
of a consolidation, merger or combination of (A) the Senior Notes Issuer into or with an Affiliate that is
not a Guarantor, clauses (1), (2), (4) and (5) under “—Senior Notes Issuer” and (B) any Guarantor into
or with an Affiliate, paragraph (4) under “—Guarantor,” as the case may be, shall apply to such
transaction; or

(6) any Permitted Transaction.

This covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary. Nothing in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall prohibit, condition or restrict the
Transactions.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Senior Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Note when due at

its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise
continued for five Business Days;

(3) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the

Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Senior Notes Indenture,
other than those set out in clauses (1) or (2) above;


-----

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be

issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness (other than, for the avoidance
of doubt, Indebtedness under any (I) Hedging Obligations, (II) Subordinated Shareholder Funding and
(III) Ancillary Facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement to the extent that a Revolving Facility is
available for drawing in order to refinance amounts outstanding under such Ancillary Facility) for
money borrowed which is Incurred or Guaranteed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving

effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross

_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal outstanding amount of any such Indebtedness, together with
the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of
principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity
of which has been accelerated, is in excess of the greater of (x) €96.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM
EBITDA;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Significant

Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments

aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) €96.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, other than
any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and
creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period
of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after such
judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly
stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of the greater

of (x) €48.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture) for any reason
other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture or the release of
any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security
Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable
and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(8) except as permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional

Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of any one or
more Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable
or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more Guarantors that is a
Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (the “guarantee
_default provisions”)._

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing under the
Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer, or the Holders of not less than
30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Senior Notes by written notice to the Senior
Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders
shall, declare the principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the then outstanding Senior Notes to be
due and payable immediately, and upon such declaration, such principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
will be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that a Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of
the first paragraph of this section will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30%
in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes notify the Senior Notes Issuer of the Default and the
Senior Notes Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clauses after receipt of such
notice.


-----

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration to accelerate the Senior Notes, such principal and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in the case of an
Event of Default arising under clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Senior Notes
(including the accrued and unpaid interest thereof) will become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. A notice of Default, notice of acceleration
or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action with
respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default set forth in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph
of this covenant may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more
than two years prior to such notice or instruction. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that the Trustee may
withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of
principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of Default described in clause
(4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes
shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30
days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior
Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Holders may not enforce the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Senior Notes
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture
may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which
may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Notes and its
consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default
is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii)
any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report
required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within
the prescribed period specified in the Senior Notes Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Notes Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity,
security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have requested in writing

the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security, indemnity

and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request

and the offer of such satisfactory security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and


-----

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have not given the

Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Notes Indenture
or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given
notice in writing of such occurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to
the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the
payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if
and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status
and what action the Senior Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Senior Notes Issuer is duly
complying with its obligations contained in the Senior Notes Indenture required to be observed and performed
by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Senior Notes
has occurred.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Senior Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Senior Notes); provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the
Senior Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes of such
series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of
clause (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes affected, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Senior Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Note
(other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Note (other than provisions
relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Note or change the time at
which any such Senior Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “Optional
_Redemption” or “Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;_

(4) make any such Senior Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Note;


-----

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Senior Notes Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes”
that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Notes in any material respect or amends
the terms of such Senior Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the
Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes
Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant described
under the heading “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the release of less than all
or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as
a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Senior Notes
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver

or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to receive
payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the
Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or a
Guarantor under any Senior Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent or
the Holders or make any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any
Senior Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material
respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Senior Notes Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior
Notes that may be issued in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture;


-----

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Notes, to add security to_
or for the benefit of the Senior Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge
or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Senior Notes when such
release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Senior Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the Senior Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the
Senior Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to
the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or the Security Agent to any
Senior Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest
in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to
be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not
prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the transfer and

legending of Senior Notes as permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture, including to facilitate the
issuance and administration of Senior Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Senior
Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Notes being transferred in violation of the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely
affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of “Permitted Reorganization” or (b)

the covenants described under the headings “Merger and Consolidation” and “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of_
assets; or

(12) as provided in “Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, as applicable) shall be entitled
to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, without further inquiry, including
Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Notes Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment of any Senior Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Notes Indenture by any
Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Notes will not be rendered invalid by such
tender. The Senior Notes Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent
fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors
under the Senior Notes Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of
Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Notes, registrations of Senior Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for


-----

security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default,
the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer),
the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provisions described
under “Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Senior Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option,
payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior
Notes. If the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Notes,
payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3)
(other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer”), (4), (5) (with
respect only to the Senior Notes Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Notes Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Senior Notes Issuer), (6), (7) or (8)
under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee
of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, in

their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must
be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law since the issuance of the Senior Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Notes Issuer with the intent

of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to

customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Senior Notes and rights of the Trustee,
as expressly provided for in the Senior Notes Indenture) as to all Senior Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior
Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Notes and
certain Senior Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been
released to the Senior Notes Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Notes
not previously delivered to the Trustee or Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii)
will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the
Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Senior Notes Issuer; (2) the Senior Notes Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in Euros or European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the
Senior Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest


-----

to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity
or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Senior Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Senior Notes Indenture; (4) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to
the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior
Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under
the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge
of the Senior Notes Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any
Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
If requested in writing by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent may distribute any amounts
deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however,
that the Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Senior Notes Issuer of such
earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the
distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include
any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the
extent that the Senior Notes are represented by Global Notes deposited with a depositary for a clearing system,
any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject
to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Senior Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture. The Senior Notes
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer
of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically
in such Senior Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Senior Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own
affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior
Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Senior Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar, the Security Agent and any other agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Senior Notes Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Notes Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Senior Notes Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is
not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior
Notes Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six
months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Senior Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Notes Indenture.


-----

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Senior Notes Issuer with respect to the Senior Notes will be
sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Senior Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will
give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests in accordance with the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it
is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for
payment thereof. Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the
Senior Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Senior Notes Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Notes and the Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Senior Notes Issuer, any
Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the
Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Senior Notes Issuer or such Guarantor,
as applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to
make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Senior Note, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the
Holder of a Senior Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Notes Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Senior Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver
granted by any Holder of a Senior Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and
will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Senior Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any Eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a nonEuro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such nonEuro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.


-----

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Senior Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the
Senior Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior
Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or
permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Notes Issuer or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Notes Indenture and
the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Senior Notes Indenture irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and
State of New York, in the United States of America. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that the Senior
Notes Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding
with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S.
federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, and the
Notes Guarantees thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes
may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Senior Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Security Documents will be governed by the laws
of France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. For the avoidance of doubt, articles 470-1 to 470-19 of the
Luxembourg law of August 10, 1915 relating to commercial companies as amended will not apply in respect of
the Senior Notes.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A
Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note will be deposited with a common depository
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the
Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests will not be
held in definitive form. Instead Euroclear and Clearstream will credit a participant’s account on their
book-entry transfer and registration systems with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws
of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities to take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair
your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form,
holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indentures. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they
own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the
Indentures.

Neither Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any
of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:

(i) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies each Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by each Issuer within 120 days; or

(ii) the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an “Event of Default” under the Indentures.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised each Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (ii), their current procedure is to request that each Issuer or cause
to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner
who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, or each Issuer, as


-----

applicable (in accordance with its respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indentures, unless that legend is not required by the Indentures
or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, each Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, any Transfer Agent and the Registrar
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of each Issuer, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

Each Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for
redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Each Issuer is
also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder
has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer.
In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other
things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indentures. Each Issuer
may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indentures and the
Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to
the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, each Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication agent
appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and each Issuer’s
requirements are met. Each Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indentures from any loss which any of them may suffer
if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. Each Issuer Registrar and Trustee may charge for any expenses
incurred by it in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due
and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indentures, each
Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such
Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the
Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
Each Issuer understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the
Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they
deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal
amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Each Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to participants’ accounts in accordance
with their customary procedures. Each Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary
practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indentures, each Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., the common
depositary (or its respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participant.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Notes will be
paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of a
Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the relevant Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require
the physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its
interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indentures.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.


-----

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indentures) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any
other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indentures) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only
as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of the
_Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a_
written certificate (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently,
the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system
and may be changed at any time. Neither Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

Each Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream
interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions
such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who or that in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The
laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.


-----

Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Special timing considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business. In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States.
United States investors who or that wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment
or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next
business day in Brussels, if Euroclear is used, or in Luxembourg, if Clearstream is used.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in
the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. Neither Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will have
any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of
their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary market trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax consequences of_
_purchasing, holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile,_
_including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a_
_comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell_
_Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to_
_you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations_
_thereof as in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject_
_to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences**

The following is a discussion of certain US federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
effects. This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a US holder (as defined below). This
discussion does not address the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax or the effects of any
US federal tax laws other than US federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or
non-US tax laws. No rulings from the US Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be
sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a
different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that
any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder
in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial
institutions, US expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, US
holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (or
investors in such entities or arrangements), persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special
tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in
an applicable financial statement and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the
Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the
applicable series of Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes
as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “US holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for US federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity
classified as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a US person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax
advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of
holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the US federal income tax
considerations discussed below, as well as the application of US federal estate and gift tax laws, the US federal
Medicare tax on net investment income, and state, local, non-US or other tax laws.


-----

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and
interest. We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated
as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is
respected, a US holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at
the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such US holder’s method of accounting for
US federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper
manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and the
Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, US holders would be required to accrue interest
income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, and to treat
as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption
of a note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment
debt instruments. US holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the
Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Note (including additional amounts, if any, paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld, if any) generally will be includible in the gross income of a US
holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the US
holder’s regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. Interest generally will be income
from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the US foreign tax credit, generally will be
considered passive category income.

A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to
the US dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether
the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. A cash basis US holder will not realize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss
attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received.

A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise
is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest
in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each
interest accrual period (or portion thereof) equal to the US dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such
accrual period (or portion thereof within the US holder’s taxable year)determined by translating such amount
into US dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the accrual period (or portion thereof) (or, with respect to
an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the US holder’s
taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual method US holder may make an election (which must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing US holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to
which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the US holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of
the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day
of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is
within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A US holder that uses the accrual method of
accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received,
equal to the difference between the US dollar value of such payment, translated at the spot rate on the date the
payment is received, and the US dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such
payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as
US-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Any non-US withholding tax paid (or deemed paid) by a US holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be
eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for US federal income tax purposes, subject
to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that
depend on a US holder’s particular circumstances. US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

A US holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the US holder. If a US
holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the US dollar value of the foreign
currency purchase price determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase. The conversion of US


-----

dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result
in taxable gain or loss for a US holder.

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder generally will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to
accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be includible in income as ordinary interest income in accordance
with the US holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the US holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an
amount of foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of that amount translated at the spot rate on the
date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and,
if it elects, an accrual method taxpayer) will determine the US dollar value of the amount realized on the
settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such
election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without
the consent of the IRS. An accrual method US holder that cannot or does not make the special election will
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the
exchange rates on the trade date and settlement date.

Holders will recognize currency gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates during the period in
which the US holder held such Notes. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will generally be equal to
the difference between the US dollar value of the US holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency
determined (1) using the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and
(2) using the spot rate on the date the US holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to
principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest (which will be treated as discussed above under
“—Payments of Stated Interest”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the
US holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as
ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for US foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

All foreign currency gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not as an adjustment of
interest income.

Any gain or loss recognized by a US holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be US source capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of a non-corporate US holder (including an
individual), any such gain may be eligible for preferential US federal income tax rates if the US holder satisfies
certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign
currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to
losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on, or the sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Note.
US holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions (including retirements or
redemptions) of Notes held by a US holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the US holder is an
exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a US holder that is not an exempt
recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and
otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements. US Holders may be required to provide such
certification on IRS Form W-9.


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against
a US holder’s US federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the
appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain US holders who are individuals (and certain entities) that hold an interest in “specified foreign financial
assets” (which may include the Notes) are required to report information (on IRS form 8938) relating to such
assets, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain
financial institutions). US holders who fail to report the required information could be subject to substantial
penalties. In addition, the statute of limitations for assessment of tax would be suspended, in whole or part.
US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership
and disposition of the Notes.

**Certain French Tax Consequences**

The following is a summary of certain French withholding tax considerations pertaining to the ownership of the
Notes. Comments which are included therein are reported only for information purposes and do not aim at
giving a complete analysis of the tax rules that may affect the Issuers the Notes or the investors. This summary
is based on provisions of French tax laws and regulations, as in force and applied by the French tax authorities at
the date of this offering memorandum, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect, or
to different interpretations. Accordingly, no opinion is expressed herein with regard to any system of law other
than the laws of France as applied by French courts as of the date of this offering memorandum. Any investor
contemplating to acquire the Notes should therefore consult its own tax adviser about the tax consequences that
may arise for it as a result of the acquisition, the ownership, the disposal or the redemption of the Notes.

**_Withholding Taxes on Payments Made Outside France_**

Holders of the Notes who concurrently hold shares of the Issuer may also be impacted by other rules not
described in this section.

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the relevant Issuer with respect to the relevant Notes, as
applicable, will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code
unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non
_coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other_
than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, irrespective of the holder’s
fiscal domicile or registered headquarters. If such payments are made outside France in a Non-Cooperative
State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, a
75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments (subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable
provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code. The list of
Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated each year.

Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and
assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the relevant Issuer’s taxable result if
they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account
held in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”).
Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as
constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case they may be
subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard
corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219-I of the French
Tax Code, 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from
January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate of 12.8% for
payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments made
outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the
French Tax Code (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable
double tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French
Tax Code nor, to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and
are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set
out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of such Deductibility


-----

Exclusion will apply in respect of the Notes if the relevant Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of
the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest and assimilated revenues in a Non-Cooperative State
(the “Exception”). Pursuant to the administrative guidelines published by the French tax authorities regarding
this legislation (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30 dated 24/02/2021, § 150 and BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20 dated 24/02/2021,
§ 290 (the “BOFIP”)), the Notes will benefit from the Exception without the relevant Issuer having to provide
any evidence supporting the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes, and accordingly will be able to
automatically benefit from the Exception (the “Safe Harbour”), if the Notes are:

    - offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code for which the publication of a prospectus is mandatory or pursuant
to an equivalent offer in a state other than a Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an
“equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the registration or submission of an offering
document by or with a foreign securities market authority); and/or

    - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral financial instruments
trading facility provided that such market or facility is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and
that such market is operated by a market operator, an investment services provider, or by such
other similar foreign entity that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; and/or

    - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities
delivery and payment systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided
that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Notes issued by the relevant Issuer under this offering memorandum qualify as debt securities under French
commercial law. To the extent that the Notes are (i) listed on the Official List of the Exchange and (ii) admitted,
at the time of their issue, to the operations of Euroclear and Clearstream, i.e., both securities delivery and
payment systems operators within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code
which are not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments made by the relevant Issuer in respect of the Notes
to their holders will fall under the Safe Harbour and will thus not be subject to the withholding tax set out under
Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, as construed by the French tax authorities under the BOFIP.
Moreover, under the same conditions, pursuant to the BOFIP and to the extent that the relevant interest and
other assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount,
interest and assimilated revenues paid by the relevant Issuer on the Notes should not be subject to the
Deductibility Exclusion and, as a result, should not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119
_bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid on an account held in a financial institution_
established in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in a NonCooperative State.

**_Withholding Taxes on Payments Made to Individuals Fiscally Domiciled in France_**

Pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Tax Code, when the paying agent (établissement payeur) is established
in France and subject to certain exceptions, interest and similar income received by individuals fiscally
domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France may be subject to a 12.8% withholding tax, which is deductible
from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social
contributions (CSG, CRDS and solidarity levy) are also levied by way of withholding at an aggregate rate of
17.2% on such interest and similar income received by individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in
France, subject to certain exceptions.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations; Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of
any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. Holders may be eligible to
receive a gross up from the payor with respect to the amounts withheld, subject to certain exceptions, as
described in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Holders of Notes should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax_
consequences if a Guarantor makes any payments with respect to the Notes.

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Consequences**

The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the laws presently in force in
Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective
investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or
foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other
charge or withholding of a similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or
concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax
(impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity
surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu des
_personnes physiques) generally. Holders of the Senior Notes may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur_
_la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income taxes, municipal business tax, as well as the_
solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes.
Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain
circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Taxation of the Holders of the Notes_**

**_Withholding Tax_**

_(i) Non-resident holders of Senior Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal,
premium or interest made to non-resident holders of Senior Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect
of the Senior Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the
Senior Notes held by non-resident holders of Senior Notes.

_(ii) Resident holders of Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of 23 December 2005, as amended
(the Relibi **Law), there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to**
Luxembourg resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Notes, nor is any
Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident
holders of Notes.

Under the Relibi Law, payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in
Luxembourg to an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding
tax of 20%. This withholding tax also applies on accrued or capitalised interest received upon disposal,
redemption or repurchase of the Notes. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the
beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth.
Responsibility for the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payment of
interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate
of 20%.

**_Income Taxation_**

_(i) Non-resident holders of Notes_

A non-resident holder of Notes, not having a permanent establishment or permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which/whom such Notes are attributable, is not subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest
accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes. A gain realised by such nonresident holder of Notes on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes is further not subject to
Luxembourg income tax.

A non-resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the
management of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg


-----

income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any
gains realised upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

_(ii) Resident holders of Notes_

Holders of Notes who are residents of Luxembourg will not be liable for any Luxembourg income tax on
repayment of principal.

(a) Luxembourg resident corporate holder of Notes

A corporate holder of Notes must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or
issue discount, as well as any gain realised on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the
Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

A corporate holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 on family estate management
companies, as amended, or by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment,
as amended, by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialised investment funds, as amended, or by the
law of July 23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds, as amended, and which does not fall
under the special tax regime set out in article 48 thereof is neither subject to Luxembourg income tax in
respect of interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, nor on gains
realised on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

(b) Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes

An individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is
subject to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received, redemption
premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes, except if (i) withholding tax has been levied on such
payments in accordance with the Relibi Law, or (ii) the individual holder of the Notes has opted for the
application of a 20% tax in full discharge of income tax in accordance with the Relibi Law, which
applies if a payment of interest has been made or ascribed by a paying agent established in a EU
Member State (other than Luxembourg), or in a Member State of the European Economic Area (other
than a EU Member State). A gain realised by an individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the
management of his/her private wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is
not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months
after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid
interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax, except if tax has been levied on such interest in
accordance with the Relibi Law.

An individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business
undertaking must include this interest in its taxable basis. If applicable, the tax levied in accordance
with the Relibi Law will be credited against his/her final tax liability.

**_Net Wealth Taxation_**

A corporate holder of Notes, whether it is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes or, if not, it maintains a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which/whom such Notes are
attributable, is subject to Luxembourg wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder of Notes is governed by the
law of May 11, 2007 on family estate management companies, as amended, by the law of December 17, 2010
on undertakings for collective investment, as amended, by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialised
investment funds, as amended, by the law of July 23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds, as
amended, or is a securitisation company governed by the law of March 22, 2004 on securitisation, as amended,
or is a capital company governed by the law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, as amended. Please
however note that securitisation companies governed by the law of March 22, 2004 on securitisation, as
amended, or capital companies governed by the law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, as amended,
or reserved alternative investment funds governed by the law of July 23, 2016, as amended, and which fall under
the special tax regime set out under article 48 thereof may, under certain conditions, be subject to minimum net
wealth tax.

An individual holder of Notes, whether he/she is a resident of Luxembourg or not, is not subject to Luxembourg
wealth tax on such Notes.


-----

**_Other Taxes_**

In principle, neither the issuance nor the transfer, repurchase or redemption of Notes will give rise to any
Luxembourg registration tax or similar taxes.

However, a fixed or ad valorem registration duty may be due upon the registration of the Notes in Luxembourg
in the case where the notes are physically attached to a public deed or to any other document subject to
mandatory registration, as well as in the case of a registration of the Notes on a voluntary basis.

Where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are
included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed passed in front of a
Luxembourg notary or recorded in Luxembourg.

_Exchange of information_

_Common reporting standard (“CRS”)_

Capitalised terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the CRS Law, (as defined below)
unless otherwise provided herein.

Under the terms of the amended Luxembourg Law of 18 December 2015 implementing Council Directive
2014/107/EU of 9 December 2014 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange
of information in the field of taxation (the “CRS Law”), the Senior Notes Issuer is likely to be treated as a
Luxembourg Reporting Financial Institution. As such, the Senior Notes Issuer will be required to annually
report to the Luxembourg tax authorities personal and financial information related, inter alia, to the
identification of, holdings by and payments made to (i) certain holders of Senior Notes qualifying as Reportable
Persons and (ii) Controlling Persons of passive non-financial entities (“NFEs”) which are themselves Reportable
Persons. This information, as exhaustively set out in Annex I of the CRS Law (the “Information”), will include
personal data related to the Reportable Persons.

The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to satisfy its reporting obligations under the CRS Law will depend on each
holder of Senior Notes providing the Senior Notes Issuer with the Information, along with the required
supporting documentary evidence. In this context, the holders of Senior Notes are hereby informed that, as data
controller, the Senior Notes Issuer will process the Information for the purposes as set out in the CRS Law.

Holders of Senior Notes qualifying as passive NFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Person(s), if
applicable, of the processing of their Information by the Senior Notes Issuer.

Additionally, the Senior Notes Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each Holder of
Senior Notes has a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such
data (if necessary). Any data obtained by the Senior Notes Issuer are to be processed in accordance with the
applicable data protection legislation.

The holders of Senior Notes are further informed that the Information related to Reportable Persons will be
disclosed to the Luxembourg tax authorities annually for the purposes set out in the CRS Law. The Luxembourg
tax authorities will, under their own responsibility, eventually exchange the reported information to the
competent authority of the Reportable Jurisdiction(s). In particular, Reportable Persons are informed that certain
operations performed by them will be reported to them through the issuance of statements, and that part of this
information will serve as a basis for the annual disclosure to the Luxembourg tax authorities.

Similarly, the holders of Senior Notes undertake to inform the Senior Notes Issuer within thirty (30) days of
receipt of these statements should any included personal data not be accurate. The holders of Senior Notes
further undertake to immediately inform the Senior Notes Issuer of, and provide the Senior Notes Issuer with all
supporting documentary evidence of any changes related to the Information after occurrence of such changes.

Although the Senior Notes Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid any fines or
penalties imposed by the CRS Law, no assurance can be given that the Senior Notes Issuer will be able to satisfy
these obligations. If the Senior Notes Issuer becomes subject to a fine or penalty as a result of the CRS Law, the
value of the Notes held by the holders of Senior Notes may suffer material losses.


-----

Any Holder of Senior Notes that fails to comply with the Company’s Information or documentation requests
may be held liable for penalties imposed on the Senior Notes Issuer as a result of such holder of Senior Notes’
failure to provide the Information and the Senior Notes Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Senior
Notes of such holder of Senior Notes.

_FATCA_

Capitalised terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the FATCA Law (as defined
below), unless otherwise provided herein.

The Senior Notes Issuer may be subject to the so-called FATCA legislation which generally requires reporting
to the US Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) of non-US financial institutions that do not comply with
FATCA and direct or indirect ownership by US persons of non-US entities. As part of the process of
implementing FATCA, the US government has negotiated intergovernmental agreements with certain foreign
jurisdictions which are intended to streamline reporting and compliance requirements for entities established in
such foreign jurisdictions and subject to FATCA.

Luxembourg has entered into a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement implemented by the FATCA Law which
requires Financial Institutions located in Luxembourg to report, when required, information on Financial
Accounts held by Specified US Persons, if any, to the Luxembourg tax authorities (administration des
_contributions directes)._

Under the terms of the amended Luxembourg law of July 24, 2015 implementing the Model 1
Intergovernmental Agreement signed between Luxembourg and the United States of America on March 28,
2014 (the “FATCA Law”), the Senior Notes Issuer is likely to be treated as a Reporting Luxembourg Financial
Institution. As such, the Senior Notes Issuer may require all holders of Senior Notes or their financial
intermediary to provide documentary evidence of their tax residence and all other information deemed necessary
to comply with the above mentioned regulations.

This status includes the obligation for the Senior Notes Issuer to regularly obtain and verify information on all
of its holders of Senior Notes. Upon request of the Senior Notes Issuer, each holder of Senior Notes shall agree
to provide certain information, including, in case of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (“NFFE”),
information on the Controlling Persons of such passive NFFE, along with the required supporting
documentation. Similarly, each holder of Senior Notes shall agree to actively provide to the Senior Notes Issuer
within thirty (30) days any information that would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address or a
new residency address.

The FATCA Law may result in the Senior Notes Issuer being obliged to disclose the name, address and taxpayer
identification number (if available) of the holders of Senior Notes as well as information such as account
balances, income and gross proceeds (non-exhaustive list) to the Luxembourg tax authorities for the purposes
set out in the FATCA Law. Such information will be relayed by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the IRS.

Holders of Senior Notes qualifying as passive NFFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Person(s), if
applicable, of the processing of their information by the Senior Notes Issuer.

Additionally, the Senior Notes Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of
Senior Notes has a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such
data (if necessary). Any data obtained by the Senior Notes Issuer are to be processed in accordance with the
applicable data protection provisions.

A failure for the Senior Notes Issuer to transmit any information to the Luxembourg tax authorities may trigger
penalties to the Senior Notes Issuer.

All prospective investors and holders of Senior Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors
regarding the possible implications of FATCA.


-----

**ERISA AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes by
(i) an “employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the United States Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) a “plan” described in and
subject to Section 4975 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
including, without limitation, an individual retirement account and an individual retirement annuity (“IRA”),
(iii) an entity deemed to hold “plan assets” of any of the foregoing pursuant to Section 3(42) of ERISA by
reason of an employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in such entity, or (iv) a governmental plan, church
plan or non-U.S. plan subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that is substantially
similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar
Law”). Each of the foregoing is referred to herein as a “Plan.”

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan that is subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of
an ERISA Plan and certain “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified
persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who
exercises discretionary authority or control over the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan,
or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to the assets of
an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering whether to invest the assets of any Plan in a Note, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its
counsel to determine, among other things, whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and
instruments governing such Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating
to a fiduciary’s duties to such Plan, including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control, conflict of interest and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any Similar Law and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or
regulations.

None of the company, the initial purchasers, any other party referred to in this Offering Memorandum or any of
their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is undertaking to act, or will undertake to act, as a fiduciary
to any Plan with respect to decisions as to an investment in the Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial
investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decisions regarding an investment in
the Notes.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving “plan assets” with persons or entities who are parties in interest or disqualified persons
with respect thereto, unless an exemption is available. For example, an ERISA Plan is prohibited from lending
money (or otherwise extending credit) to a party in interest or disqualified person, unless an exemption is
available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and any fiduciary who
authorizes such a transaction may be subject to personal liability, and any such transaction may need to be
reversed or otherwise corrected. In addition, if the Plan involved in a non-exempt prohibited transaction is an
IRA, the IRA could under certain circumstances lose its tax-exempt status. The acquisition and/or holding of a
Note by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the initial purchasers are considered to be a party in interest
or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406
of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with an
applicable statutory or administrative prohibited transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that
may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition
and holding of a Note depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire
such Note and the relationship of the party in interest or the disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. These class
exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, relating to transactions effected by independent qualified
professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate
accounts, PTCE 91-38, relating to investments by bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, relating to
investments by life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23, relating to transactions directed by


-----

in-house asset managers. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of
the Code provide exemptions for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in
interest and/or a disqualified person with respect to that ERISA Plan (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that,
directly or indirectly, has or exercises discretionary authority or control, or renders investment advice with
respect to, the ERISA Plan assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the
ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that, in connection with the transaction, the
ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration. There can be no assurance that
any of the foregoing exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to all possible prohibited
transactions that might occur in connection with an ERISA Plan’s investment in the Notes or that all of the
conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of
ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) that are subject to Similar Law may
purchase or hold a Note only in compliance with such Similar Law.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes offered hereby (and interests therein) should not be acquired or held by any
person investing the assets of any Plan unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code or a violation of any Similar Law.

**Representation**

Accordingly, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note offered hereby (or any interest therein) will be
deemed to have represented and warranted that (A) either (i) no portion of the assets used to acquire or hold
such Note (or any interest therein) constitutes the assets of any Plan, or (ii) the acquisition, holding and
disposition of such Note (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Law and
(B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Note (or any interest therein) otherwise than to a purchaser or
transferee that is deemed to make these same representations and warranties with respect to its acquisition,
holding and disposition of such Note (or any interest therein).

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note (or any interest therein) that is an ERISA Plan will be
further deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any
investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the
assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to
invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of
ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the
ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Notes, and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in
evaluating the investment in the Notes.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the potential excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may be imposed on persons involved in
non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering
purchasing or holding a Note (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with
their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to
such investment and whether an exemption would be necessary and applicable to an investment in a Note
offered hereby.

Each purchaser of a Note (or any interest therein) has the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase,
holding and subsequent disposition of a Note offered hereby (or any interest therein), complies with the
fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws. The sale of
any Notes offered hereby to any Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or
representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by
Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any
particular Plan. This disclosure is intended to be general in nature and is not directed at any specific purchaser.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Each Issuer, the Issue Date Guarantors and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs
Bank Europe SE, Natixis, BofA Securities Europe SA, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, HSBC
Continental Europe SA, ING Bank N.V., SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Europe GmbH, UniCredit Bank AG
and Credit Suisse Securities, Sociedad de Valores, S.A., as Initial Purchasers, have entered into a purchase
agreement dated the date of this Offering Memorandum with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has
agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes Issuer has
agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Senior Notes
Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Notes from each Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of
this Offering Memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the Offering’s price
for each series of Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell
Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United States-registered broker dealers.
To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they will do so
only through one or more US registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable US law.

In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

    - the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are
subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel;

    - during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that
is 45 days after such date, none of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or
other affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft,
BNP Paribas and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of or announce an intention to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of,
except as provided hereunder, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers or any of
their respective subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes (other than the Notes);
and

    - each Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act,
and/or will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set
forth on the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of each Issuer may purchase a portion of the Notes in the
Offering.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Notes may not be offered or
sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to
Rule 144A and Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an
offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance
with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40-day period,
neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer


-----

_Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the_
Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial
Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so.
The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market-making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In
addition, such market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market
will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you
receive when you sell will be favorable.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and
syndicate-covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a
short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open
market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate-covering transactions
involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in
stabilizing or syndicate-covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the fourth business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+4 ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange
Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to
any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of
pricing or the next successive business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will
settle in T+4, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should
consult their advisors.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

    - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom; and

    - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to each Issuer or
the Guarantors.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by any of the
Issuers or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction
where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the
distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors.”

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to the Issuers or the
Guarantors, as applicable, in the past and received fees in relation to arranging such loans. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will perform, banking,
investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for each Issuer and its affiliates, as
applicable, and may have from time to time in the past held, and may in the future hold, positions in our or any
of our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general derivative transactions with us or our affiliates in the
ordinary course of business for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and
reimbursement of expenses. In particular, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity


-----

securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve
securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates, including the Notes. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing Senior Credit Facilities and thus may receive a portion of the
proceeds from the Offering upon repayment thereof. In addition, Natixis and/or its respective affiliates is the
facility agent and security agent under the Existing Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and will act as the facility
agent under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their affiliates are
expected to be lenders, arrangers or holder other roles under the New Senior Credit Facilities.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the
Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered
hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or
express independent research views in respect of each Issuer, the group, such securities or financial instruments
and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a general discussion of the insolvency laws of several jurisdictions for informational purposes_
_only and does not address all the legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes._

**European Union**

**_EU Insolvency Regulation_**

The Issuers and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Luxembourg, which are
Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on
July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on
June 5, 2015.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective
insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member
State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The
determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is
required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision
may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor
shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor
has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary.
This presumption shall apply only if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another
Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is
located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and a comprehensive assessment of all the
relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of
management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under
the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined
the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a
debtor’s COMI, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts
the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are
established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for
the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the
time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is, and will remain, located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.


-----

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary
(territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member
State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for
commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of
operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to
commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall
be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of
the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in
which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the
debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State
in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency
proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the
operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of
territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the
law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions,
be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction
over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been
opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the
insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not
affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable
assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time,
belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening
of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

    - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

    - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of
the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

    - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

    - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States, so long as no secondary
proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State
that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise
the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets
of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings
have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary
further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has
assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of
the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the
main proceedings are located in another Member State, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened
in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request
to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation
of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, and to the preservation of


-----

the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove
assets of the company from that other Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by
giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary
insolvency proceedings could be opened, that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a
result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the
relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such
undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors,
determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is
binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at
the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if
it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three
months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the
insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a
request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be
continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the
court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to
guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of
creditors.

Following the entry into force of the Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where
there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a company’s COMI has shifted in the preceding three months the
rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the
opening of secondary proceedings in another EU Member State—which will no longer be limited only to
“winding up proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has an establishment in such EU Member
State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in
such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency
proceedings.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable
insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuers and the
Guarantors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

(a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency
proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of
main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and
communication between (i) courts and (i) insolvency practitioners and courts;

(b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient
administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same
group;

(c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

(d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such
insolvency registers.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019, on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on
June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that: (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that
are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable
them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit
from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance; and
(iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in
particular, with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for
preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in
order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an
early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be
ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which: (a) a stay of
individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national
legislation; (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a
commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate
classes); (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in
number of affected parties in each class; and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring
plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors, even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted, the plan will
have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will, in particular, ensure the protection of
each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan.

The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim
financing, and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the
restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by
July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for
which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 1, 2024 or, in others, on July 17,
2026), subject to a maximum one-year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering
particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

Although which proceedings will be affected by the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into French
law has not yet been determined, it seems likely that safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings will be substantially amended to take into consideration the
provisions of the Directive.

The major differences between the Directive and current French insolvency law lie in:

(a) the introduction of classes of creditors into French law based on a commonality of interests, as opposed
to the current classification of creditors in accordance with the nature of their contractual relationship
with the debtor and irrespective of their actual chances of repayment, i.e. as credit institutions, main
suppliers or bondholders; and

(b) the possibility to set up shareholders as one specific class when their rights may be impaired, allowing
other classes of creditors to impose a plan on shareholders, which can only occur in very restrictive
circumstances under current French law.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

French laws and proceedings affecting creditors include debt rescheduling pursuant to Articles 1343-5 et seq. of
the French Civil Code (Code civil), court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and procédure de conciliation)
and court-administered proceedings being either safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée), accelerated financial safeguard proceeding
(procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings
(procédure de redressement or procedure de liquidation judiciaire). In addition, any company of our Group
having its center of main interests, within the meaning of the New Insolvency Regulation or, if not applicable,
its COMI within the meaning of article R.600-1 of the French Commercial Code or an establishment in France,
could also be subject to French court administered proceedings. Any company of our Group having an
establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State could be subject to French territorial
insolvency proceedings.

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of either of any
member of the Group (such as French Guarantor or Issuer) is in France (to the extent, however, that its center of
main interests, within the meaning of EU Insolvency Regulation, is not in another jurisdiction), it could be
subject to French proceedings affecting creditors including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or
_conciliation proceedings) and court-administered proceedings being either safeguard proceedings (procedure de_
_sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial_
safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings
(procedure de redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (procedure de liquidation judiciaire).
In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their
main center of interests within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code or an
establishment in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings. Any company of
our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State could be subject to
French territorial insolvency proceedings.

Specialized courts exist for: (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or
exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in
turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in turnover; (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect
to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation; or
(iii) in cases where the EU Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within
the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate
group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international
jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control
thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this
purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings
in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment
over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the
Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our Group having its COMI in France would be
subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any
company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other
than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to
holders of the Notes. Such proceedings will likely be amended in the context of the transposition of the
Restructuring Directive into French law with respect to which French statute n°2019-486 dated May 22, 2019
(“Loi Pacte”) grants the French government twenty-four months to enact appropriate measures through
ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive.

**Warning Procedure (procédure d’alerte)**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for warning procedures.
When there are elements which they believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, the
statutory auditors of a company must request the management to provide an explanation. Failing satisfactory
explanation or appropriate corrective measures, the auditors must request that a board of directors (or the
equivalent body), and, as the case may be, at a later stage the shareholders’ meeting be convened. Depending on
the answers provided to them (and the type of company), the auditors must inform the President of the relevant
commercial or civil court of the warning procedure.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee (or, in their absence, the
employees’ representatives) have similar rights.

The President of the relevant commercial or civil court can also himself summon the management to provide
explanations on elements which the President of the relevant commercial or civil court believes put the
company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy (or when the company has not filed its annual financial
statements within the statutory timeframe, despite his/her injunction).

**_Temporary measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain temporary measures have recently been enacted by the French
Government to adapt French insolvency law to the health crisis (Ordinance No. 2020-1443 dated November 25,
2020, in force as from November 26, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from
December 8, 2020).

In particular, until December 31 2021, pursuant to article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November 25,
2020, in force as from November 26, 2020, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation
proceedings may be extended one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a
maximum of 10 months (see “—Conciliation Proceedings”).

In addition, article 124 of Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020
extends until December 31, 2021, the following measures that were initially adopted by Ordinance n°2020-596
dated May 20, 2020, in force as from May 21, 2020 that were due to expire on December 31, 2020:

    - additional specific measures aimed at protecting debtors and an adaptation of the provisions
governing grace periods in the context of conciliation proceedings (see “—Conciliation
_Proceedings” and “—Grace Periods”);_

    - the loosening of the conditions for eligibility to Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings and
Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings (see “—Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings”);

    - the supervising judge’s right, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the
creditors’ representative, to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement
proposal the deadline during which creditors can respond to a debt settlement proposal in the
context of a standard consultation for the approval of a safeguard or reorganization plan (see
“—Adoption of the Safeguard or Reorganization Plan”);

    - the possible up to two-year extension of the duration of the safeguard or reorganization plan,
as a result of which such a plan can now last up to 12 years (see “—Adoption of the Safeguard
_or Reorganization Plan”); and_

    - the grant of a special privilege for creditors that make new cash contributions to the debtor
during the observation period in order to ensure the continuation of the company’s business
and its survival, and for those who undertake to make such contribution for the execution of
the safeguard or reorganization plan ordered or modified by the court (the “S/R Lien”).


-----

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may be put in
place within the following weeks or months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5
of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving
the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and
the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years, the payment
dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or
rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as
published annually by decree by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to
repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any
pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue
or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace
periods. When the debtor benefits from a conciliation proceeding, these statutory provisions shall be read in
combination with Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, pursuant to which the judge may impose
grace periods on creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social
security administrations) for their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course
of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted Proceedings”).

**_Out-of-court and in-court proceedings_**

French law distinguishes between:

    - court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation), which are voluntary proceedings
in which the debtor seeks the help of a third party to negotiate an agreement with all or part of
its creditors and stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties with a view to, in particular,
restructuring its indebtedness. These proceedings are confidential. The third party is
appointed by the President of the competent commercial court upon proposal of the debtor
company, but the discussions themselves are conducted outside the court; and

    - court-administered proceedings (procédures collectives), which are proceedings, during which
payments by the debtor and legal actions by the creditors are suspended (automatic stay).
These proceedings are public and involve all creditors (except for accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings, as discussed below). Within this second category, French law further
distinguishes between:

        - safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings, which are voluntary proceedings and available to debtors that
are facing difficulties they cannot overcome, but that are not insolvent (as defined
below); and

        - judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, which are mandatory
proceedings and must be opened by debtors that are insolvent.

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable
to pay its due debts with its available assets (actif disponible), taking into account available credit lines, existing
debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

If judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced; the date of insolvency (état de cessation
_des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or_
judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months
before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date
than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of


-----

conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see “—The
_“hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings”)._

**_Court-assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties without being insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) (or for 45
calendar days or less in the case of conciliation proceedings) may in certain conditions request the
commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to help the
company reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g., an agreement to reduce or
reschedule its indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation are informal proceedings that may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its_
sole discretion and are carried out under the supervision of the president of the relevant court, which do not
trigger any stay of enforcement against the debtor. In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors
that are facing any type of difficulties (economic or financial) but are not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test”
above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision
appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a
court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the
supervision of the president of the court and do not automatically involve any stay of the claims or pending
proceedings. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by
the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations
with creditors but cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. Any agreement between the debtor
and its main creditors (if any) will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not
willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do
not automatically stay any pending proceedings, and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the
debtor to recover their claims, but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to
do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period
under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above). The agreement reached is
reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. The ordinance of the court appointing
the Mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for informational purposes to the debtor’s auditors.

_Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of_
a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above), or has not been
insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of
the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the
aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under
the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period
of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up
to the absolute maximum of five months). Pursuant to article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated 25 November
2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force as from 26 November 2020, until December
31, 2021, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of the conciliation proceedings may be extended, one or
more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court up to a maximum of 10 months.

The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors
and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its
indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and
voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it.
_Conciliation proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure to statutory auditors if any and subject to the_
below) and may last up to five months, and do not automatically stay any pending proceedings, and creditors are
not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims, but those that have accepted to
take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency
proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the
conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings,
the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period, in accordance with
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally
put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the
conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation
proceedings.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government,
Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 of May 20, 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020

-----

1443 of November 25, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, have modified conciliation
proceedings to provide that, until December 31, 2021:

(a) the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator, thereby
increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of five months
previously);

(b) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to
defer payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request
from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the
conciliation proceedings:

(c) the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment
default;

(d) the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable
property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would
not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor;

(e) the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim; or

(f) the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in
accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—France—Grace periods” above)
even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not
accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of
his claim for the duration of the conciliation.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is
acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to
participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have
formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the
conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to
monitor the implementation of the agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the
Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular,
performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor
to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to
a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request
of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives,
as the case may be, must be convened if: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the
effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the
company will survive as a going concern; and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the
non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as
described above and, in addition:

    - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only
disclose the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security
interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise
remain confidential, except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are
informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full
conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court;

    - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or
services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than
shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of
payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to
certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs)


-----

(the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

    - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New
Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date
may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization
plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders general
meeting in this respect are the subject of debate);

    - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is
communicated to its statutory auditors; and

    - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test” above), and, therefore, the
starting date of the hardening period (as defined below, see “—The “hardening period”
_(période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by_
the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by
the court (except in case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor,
appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord)
during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:

    - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

    - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings
for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as
explained above; and

    - a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with
respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation
agreement, as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation
proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the
court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If
such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked.
Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors
with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended. The
commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the
conciliation agreement, in which case, the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already
received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors that is likely to meet
the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated
safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

In the event of the commencement of subsequent safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, within the
context of the adoption of a safeguard plan or a recovery plan, the court will not be able to impose a payment
deferral to a date later than the date on which the plan is adopted, or debt reductions, to creditors with respect to
their claims benefiting from the New Money Lien. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking
part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also
be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the
business” (plan de cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial
reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers
received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may be directly considered by the court in
the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the
State prosecutor.


-----

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing
contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a
_mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end, or_
(ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the
commencement of conciliation proceedings, for the portion that would exceed three-quarters of the total fees of
the professional advisors retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being
reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any
specific legal consequences for the debtor; in particular, it does not result in the automatic commencement of
insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed
as from the end of the previous ones.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency
_Test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at_
which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard
proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small
companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the
debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing
the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings),
which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in
preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors. Creditors
do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the
court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the
judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de
_surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance) and to_
prepare a safeguard plan for the company, all under the supervision of the court.

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_
representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert
the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any
time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) in case no plan has been adopted by the
relevant creditors committee and, if any, the bondholders general meeting (as described below), if the approval
of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should
safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if
the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

    - the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor or on its own initiative and in all such cases
with the exception of (i) (b) above where:

        - the court may act upon its own initiative; and

        - the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public
Prosecutor may only act in the event that no plan has been adopted by the relevant
creditors committee and, if any, the bondholders general meeting (as described
below);

        - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and
the workers’ representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes
immediately due and payable.


-----

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government,
Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, modified safeguard
proceedings to provide that:

    - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or
reorganization proceedings, a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created (the “S/R
Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and
December 31, 2021. The S/R Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory preference
enjoyed by financing granted, with the approval of the bankruptcy judge, after commencement
of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period.

    - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made
through a share capital increase, by any person:

        - during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business
and its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by
the bankruptcy judge, or

        - or the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as
approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being
specified that the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as
well as the relevant amounts.

    - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and
post-commencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims,
procedural costs and the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard
proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings.

    - Such claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement
of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the
proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is
prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in
order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover
goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are
required to declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the debts that arose
prior to the commencement of the proceedings (as well as the post-proceedings commencement non-privileged
debts) and are prohibited from engaging individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment default in
relation to such debts and the accrual of interest on loans with a term of less than one year, or on payments
deferred for less than one year, is stopped. Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings
and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’ ordinary activities during the observation period or are
for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this
period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts
incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the
New Money Lien).

The manner in which the liabilities will be settled as provided for in the plan (debt remissions and payment
terms) must be submitted to the creditors during a consultation, or if rejected on an individual basis, prior to the
plan being approved by the court.

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard
plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court.
The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

_Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor_
or prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of
€20 million or less unless, upon their or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court, they are
subject to the committee-based consultation (see below).


-----

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’
representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and
payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether
the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition differing treatment as
between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved
by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make
a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims
over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen
years).

Pursuant to article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 until December 31,
2021, the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is
approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors consulted in writing that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal
(other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative
keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator
and the controllers.

Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until December 31,
2021, the abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or the court-appointed creditors’ representative.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that_
were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the
New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses
where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by
the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-forequity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting
the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the
total amount of the debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the
initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the
amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance
with the specific rules in order to ensure that the full amount of the claim is repaid within the 10 year period.

_Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory_
auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) and with more
than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request
and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditor
committees that are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to
the judgment commencing the proceedings:

    - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or
advances in favor of the debtor (or their successors) (the “credit institutions committee”); and

    - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of
the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such
committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”).


-----

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including
capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities
will be established (the “bondholders general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of
whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general
meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the
committee or general meeting.

It is unclear whether the Security Agent as creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Intercreditor Agreement would
vote in the creditor’s committee.

The proposed plan:

    - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

    - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

    - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime
of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps
(debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by
way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where
applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also
prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of
the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative
plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders general meeting
and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not
permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period
may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority
vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). Each member of a
creditors committee or of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed
administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total
payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed
administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors
committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the
president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the courtappointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In
addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a
payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do
not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to
the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the bondholders general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of
creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders in accordance with the standard consultation
process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the
interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has
been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members
of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the
plan).

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders general meeting within
the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject


-----

it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a
period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the
committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within
the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones
applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the court empowers the administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting to take corporate resolutions with
respect to the modification of the debtor’s share capital required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that,
under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending
or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the
shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving
access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple
majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at
least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions
relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential
to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general
bondholders meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire
or the State prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings
if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings
would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security_
and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar
to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a
similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages,
or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions to examine
possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de
_Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief_
may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings which reach a conciliation agreement (supported by the
majority but not all of its creditors) may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde
_financière accélérée) allowing a restructuring plan to be rapidly approved by the two-thirds vote of the_
creditors’ committees and bondholders’ general meeting applicable in safeguard proceedings.

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to
“fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those:

    - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French
Commercial Code; or

    - whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public
accountant and who have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million
(excluding applicable taxes) or (iii) whose total balance sheet assets exceeds €1.5 million.

However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020 1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide
that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and
December 31, 2021.

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the
court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision in order for the debtor to be eligible to accelerated
safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.


-----

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor
must fulfil the following conditions:

    - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

    - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

    - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not
in a position to overcome; and

    - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business
as a going concern that is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to
render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for
financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a
maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions
committee and bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan
through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor
to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply,
any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings
or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement
non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard
plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax
or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to
their contractual or legal terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a
committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de
_sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière_
_accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee,_
but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “—committee-based
_consultation”)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated_
safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). In particular,
the creditors committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard
plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard
proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not
apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is
adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for
rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their
consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall
terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee
process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide
that for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the
creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the


-----

creditors representative or the public prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings shall be drawn up by the debtor and certified
by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated
safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see “—Status of Creditors
_during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or_
_Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of_
_Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization_
_or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”)._

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as
discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would
have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order
the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the
debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial
reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period,
upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire), a controller, the State prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial_
reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is
manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives
(if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of
employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of
share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

Under the judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator appointed by the court will assist the debtor to
make management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the
management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). As a result of the commencement of
liquidation proceedings, the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of the management. In the event of
judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the
court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and
make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial
reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of
the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission
_d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission_
_d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to_
safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially with respect to committees of creditors, the
bondholders general meeting and the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de
_redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At_
any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative,
order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its
recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is
decided by the court.


-----

In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to
provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—France - Court-administered Proceedings –
_Safeguard”). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the_
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a
shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution
if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies)
undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the
total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the
meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local
employment (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid
harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going
concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review
of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the
court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the
modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such
modification, the insolvency court may either:

    - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the
share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount
provided for in the reorganization plan; or

    - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale
of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital
modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them
with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other
shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent
clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the
company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, is
determined by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders
to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the
reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is
generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial
liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to
represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities
to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority
order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of
the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

    - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary
period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months,
renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale,
a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency
law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; or

    - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:


-----

    - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

    - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase
offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary
to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

    - request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested purchasers
to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the
bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed
before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement
such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to
be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to
pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to
insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial
transfer of the business. The court may also terminate the proceedings:

    - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared
to the difficulty of selling the assets;

    - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a
mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from
these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months
before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a
date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of
conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the
hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court
decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court,
such as:

    - automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the
hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to
the detriment of other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside by the court
if a claimant (such as an insolvency officer or the public prosecutor) so requests. These
include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under
which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other
party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made
in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or
monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as
bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with article 2350 of the French Civil Code,
security granted for debts (including a security to secure a guarantee obligation) previously
incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the
attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the
transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as
security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie)
that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to
such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration
_d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code._


-----

    - transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due,
transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in
each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor
was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no
consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the
beginning of the hardening period. Unlike with respect to void transactions, which must be
set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it
appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.”

**_Status of Creditors During Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial_**
**_Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the safeguard or insolvency proceedings
triggers (or gives creditors the right to trigger) the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial
liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the
termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual
_provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing_
_the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance_
with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to
be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the
court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it
believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can
require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have
been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and
_provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other_
terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however,
automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued
operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such
case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the sale plan
(plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once), as described above, or on the
date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

    - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of
contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued
interest can no longer be compounded);

    - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related
(connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to
recover assets required by the continued operation of the business);

    - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the
proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

    - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services
rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall
due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien),
_provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one,_
the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan
commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

    - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings)
may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or, during the
observation period, against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person
and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard or


-----

judicial reorganization proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court
decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

    - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the
creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as
described below);

    - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

    - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation
proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution
judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible,
movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in
which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency
proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation;

    - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms
of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract
(contrat en cours), will be required.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan
_de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de_
_redressement”)._

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the
creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings or the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
respectively (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the
ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of
the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales);
this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also
file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month
period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been
submitted during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors representative, are,
except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings.
Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the
creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed
the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a
filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or
amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the
claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings however, debts owed to creditors other
than banks, financial institutions or bondholders should be paid in the ordinary course, and the debtor draws a
list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its
statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process,
they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their
claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Those
financial creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (but who would belong to the financial
institutions’ committee or the bondholders general meeting) would have to file their proofs of claim within the
aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.


-----

If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation
proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors
according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the
liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of managing the debtor, selling the assets of the debtor and
settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where the sale of the business
is considered, the court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the debtor during the temporary
continuation of the business operations (see above) and organize the sale of the business process.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees,
post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien
or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social
charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors
whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of
priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention
right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of share
capital of the debtor will be required.

The mandataire judiciaire may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share capital.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held
liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was
wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, or (ii) interfered with the management of the debtor
or (iii) obtained security or guarantees that are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or
guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can
be cancelled or reduced by the court.

_Exceptional measures related to COVID-19 Epidemic_

In the context of COVID-19 epidemic and the state of health emergency and lock-down measures that have been
imposed in France, it should be noted that recourse to court-assisted proceedings and court-administered
proceedings has been more difficult during the lock-down period. Therefore, ordinance n°2020-341 of
March 27, 2020, ordinance n°2020-596 of May 20, 2020 (as modified by article 124 of French law n°2020-1525
of December 7, 2020) and ordinance n°2020-1443 of November 25, 2020 (together, the “French COVID
_Insolvency Ordinances”) temporarily adapt the procedures for dealing with businesses which are facing_
difficulties to take account of the conditions under which they are implemented during the sanitary emergency
(état d’urgence sanitaire) and in the months following its cessation. In particular, it encourages the use of
court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation) and lengthens the timeframe for court-administered
proceedings. The provisions of these ordinances are applicable until December 31, 2020, July 17, 2021 or
December 31, 2021, as the case may be.

_Enhanced information of the president of the commercial court for the prevention of company difficulties_

Under the early warning procedure (procedure d’alerte) provided for in articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3
of the French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal
representative of the company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of
the competent court of the inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this
measure is to provide the president of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with
information relating to the difficulties encountered by a company. These provisions are applicable until and
including December 31, 2021. Enhanced information of the president of the commercial court for the
prevention of company difficulties.

Under the early warning procedure (procedure d’alerte) provided for in articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3
of the French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal
representative of the company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of
the competent court of the inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this
measure is to provide the president of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with


-----

information relating to the difficulties encountered by a company. These provisions are applicable until and
including December 31, 2021.

_Enhanced effectiveness of conciliation proceedings_

The French COVID-19 Insolvency Ordinances implement measures aimed at considerably enhancing the
efficiency of conciliation proceedings.

The duration of conciliation proceedings can be increased, at the request of the conciliator, once or several
times, provided that the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings shall not exceed 10 months (instead of
four months, extendable once for an additional period of 1 month, previously).

Until December 31, 2021, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by
the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor in
conciliation may apply to the president of the court which ordered the commencement of the procedure, in ex
parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:

    - to stay or prohibit any legal action by a creditor with a view to order the debtor to pay a sum
of money or to terminate a contract for non-payment of a sum of money;

    - to stay or prohibit any enforcement proceedings by a creditor on both movable and immovable
property, as well as any distribution proceedings which have not become fully effective prior
to the application; and

    - to defer or reschedule creditors’ claims which are due and payable.

These measures may be combined with the request for grace periods under Articles 1343-5 of the French Civil
Codes, as already provided for in Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code. Even before the creditor
sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the
conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the
conciliation.

These new provisions allow the implementation of a hybrid conciliation procedure, the effects of which are
similar to those of safeguard proceedings but without the disadvantages. These provisions are applicable to
ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2021.

_Provisions aimed at facilitating the use of accelerated proceedings_

The use of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) is facilitated, by removing the threshold
conditions provided for in Article L. 628-1 of the French Commercial Code relating to the employees and
turnover thresholds for the safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and the financial
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

If the accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or financial safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) fail and no plan is drawn up within the period
provided for in the first paragraph of Article L. 628-8 of the French Commercial Code, the court may
immediately, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator (administrateur judiciaire), the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor (ministere public), open separate judicial
reorganization (procédure de redressement) or liquidation proceedings (procédure de liquidation judiciaire).
The aim is to make these pre-pack proceedings available to as many companies as possible. These provisions
are applicable to proceedings initiated between May 21, 2020 until the earlier of July 17, 2021 (inclusive) and
the date of entry into force of the upcoming ordinance that will transpose under French law the requirements of
EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 (i.e., the insolvency
proceedings harmonization directive).


-----

_Provisions to facilitate the adoption of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) or a judicial reorganization plan_
_(plan de redressement)_

The adoption of a safeguard or judicial reorganization plan is facilitated and accelerated by:

    - shortening the timelines for consulting creditors to 15 days in the event of the presentation of a
draft plan at the request of the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the judicial
administrator (administrateur judiciaire), with the authorization of the insolvency judge (juge
_commissaire);_

    - a reduction in the formalities for consulting creditors: proposals for the settlement of debts as
well as any responses to these proposals may be communicated by any means enabling the
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) to establish with certainty the date of their
receipt;

    - the finalization of the plan exceptionally based on outstanding liabilities estimated on the basis
of a certificate from the chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) or statutory auditor, on
admitted, uncontested and identifiable claims (those for which the deadline for filing has not
expired).

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings up to and including December 31, 2021.

_Provisions aimed at facilitating the implementation of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) and a judicial_
_reorganization plan (plan de redressement)_

The Ordinance dated May 20, 2020 provides for provisions to facilitate the implementation of safeguard and
judicial reorganization plans by:

    - increasing by a maximum of two years the duration of the execution of the safeguard or
judicial reorganization plans (i.e. a maximum duration of 12 years or 17 years in the
agricultural sector);

    - deeming failure to reply from creditors consulted for the adoption or modification of the plan
to be acceptance of the proposed new payment terms;

    - introducing the S/R Lien, for persons who make a new cash contribution to the debtor either
during the observation period, or within the framework of the safeguard or judicial
reorganization plan (these new contributions will be mentioned in the judgment which adopts
or modifies the plan). Creditors benefiting from this safeguard or judicial reorganization
privilege are paid, for the amount of their contribution, in the order provided for in III of
Article L. 622-17 and III of Article L. 641-13 of the French Commercial Code, i.e., after wage
claims. Contributions granted by the shareholders and partners of the debtor in the context of
a capital increase are excluded from the safeguard or judicial reorganization privilege. Such
claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2021, with the
exception of the provisions on the safeguard privilege applicable as from May 21, 2020 and at the latest until
and including December 31, 2021.

_Provisions to facilitate the sale of the business_

Adjustments relating to the sale of the business have been provided and in particular, a reduction in the notice
period required to convene the contracting parties provided for in article R. 642-7 of the French Commercial
Code from 15 to 8 days in the event of a plan for the sale of the business (this notice period may however be
modified by decree pursuant to article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020).

These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2020.

_Provisions aimed at facilitating recovery of the company_

The period at the end of which the mention in the trade and company registry of safeguard and judicial
reorganization proceedings is deleted from the register if the plan is still in progress is reduced to one year (this


-----

period may however be modified by decree pursuant to article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020). These
provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including July 17, 2021 at the latest.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

    - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French
Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1
of the French Commercial Code; and

    - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another
company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition and a contractual financial
limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes (including any
additional Notes) which the Issuers have (i) applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each French Guarantor
and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through the intercompany loans, cash pooling
arrangements or similar arrangements that are outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by
such French Guarantor or (ii) used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness previously on-lent
directly or indirectly to a French Guarantor or its controlled subsidiaries through the intercompany loans or
similar arrangements and that are, in each case, outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by
such French Guarantor

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could subordinate or declare
any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee or
security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if it found
that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit to the guarantor and
whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which
French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder that
represent either (i) the amount of debt made available directly or indirectly to that French Guarantor or its
subsidiaries with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred by a holding company of such French
Guarantor to the extent that such Indebtedness is or has been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds
of Indebtedness of the Issuers constituting Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which
term includes the Notes offered hereby; and (ii) the amounts of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly,
to such French Guarantor, and the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, under intercompany loans or
similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor
under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the
obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by
such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By
virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Guarantees. The amount secured by any Collateral which is granted by any such French Guarantor (or any other
guarantor which is incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the amount which it is so able to
guarantee. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return
that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an
arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length
transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security
Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be
noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to
perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock


-----

company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account
(nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities
account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement
_de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge_
will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry
(registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for
security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that
no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be enforced
following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount that is due and
unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a
pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being
paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the
context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual
foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be
required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as
so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by
the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the
acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

**_Security Agent_**

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal
guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate.
As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if
the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of
a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or
willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the
secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency
proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its
duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

_Parallel Debt_

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor
be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not
hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or
as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code, (which will be the case here
for the Security Documents governed by French law). The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time
will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit indirectly
from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in
favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as
principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes


-----

Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in
the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel
Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security
Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French
law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the
other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement
actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some
instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). Although the French supreme court
(Cour de cassation) has held (in a decision dated September 13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n°
10-25.533 Belvédère) rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain
conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the laws of the State of New York was not
incompatible with the French law concept of international public policy (ordre public international), this
decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security
agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be
effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will
eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in
the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral.

Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture that become particularly important following default or events of default, and acts as trustee in a
fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

_Trustee_

Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Trustee as trustee for the holders of the
Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture,
and may therefore not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been recognized for
tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the French Tax Code and the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) has
held, in the Belvédère decision referred to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly
appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in
safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above,
France has not ratified The Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their
recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. To the extent
that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement
of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with
the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee.

_Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French courts_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking
pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the
relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company
are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as
pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can
be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are
registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from
the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking pledge
thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide that the
possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers convenus”
(entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the creation


-----

of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as
_tiers convenus and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking and the_
second or lower ranking secured parties. To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the
concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, if article 2340 of the
French Civil Code does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset,
this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial securities account, and consequently, no
assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is
a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company
are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially
adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event.

_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Pledges Over Receivables/Bank Accounts_

The pledges over receivables/bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are
available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over receivables/bank accounts. As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables/bank accounts of a
company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank accounts from
granting a second ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts, this structure has not been tested
before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be upheld if
tested.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to
which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of
the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant
debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who
was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any
such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without
an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any
creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act
was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or
more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the
legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is
necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the grant of the security interests in
the Collateral, or the granting of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did
not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the granting of
the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be declared
unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in
relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the
benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the
Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Senior Secured Notes received with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees could
also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and, possibly, from subsequent
transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Senior Secured Notes might be held liable for
any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of
the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30-2 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in
the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or reorganization plan which is


-----

put to the vote of the creditors’ committees takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of
subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the
safeguard, or judicial reorganization, proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above
(which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out
that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency_**

The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to holders of Senior Notes as insolvency laws of
other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The Senior Notes Issuer is incorporated and has its
centre of main interests (centre des intérêts principaux), for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation, and
its registered office and central administration (administration centrale) in Luxembourg. Accordingly,
insolvency proceedings affecting the Senior Notes Issuer would be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws.
The following is a brief description of the key features of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings and certain
aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg.

**_Luxembourg insolvency proceedings_**

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of insolvency proceedings (together referred to as
“Insolvency Proceedings”) may be opened against the Senior Notes Issuer to the extent that the Senior Notes
Issuer has its central administration (administration centrale) or its centre of main interests (centre des intérêts
_principaux) (for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in Luxembourg:_

  - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite);

  - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée); and

  - preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite).

In addition to these Insolvency Proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Senior Notes to receive payment on
the Senior Notes may be affected by a decision of the Commercial District Court (Tribunal d’arrondissement
_siégeant en matière commerciale) granting suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) or putting the Senior_
Notes Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire).

**_Bankruptcy proceedings (faillite)_**

**General administration of bankruptcy proceedings**

The opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be requested by the Senior Notes Issuer or by any of its creditors.
Following such a request, the Commercial District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings
in the event that the Senior Notes Issuer (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) has
lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court considers that
these conditions are met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by the
Senior Notes Issuer or a creditor.

If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy receivers
(curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to
supervise the bankruptcy proceedings.

The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in the
judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into
account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds.

The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the Senior Notes Issuer in place of the
managers. The bankruptcy receiver will realize the Senior Notes Issuer ’s assets and distribute the proceeds to
the Senior Notes Issuer ’s creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds
left, to the bankrupt company’s shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver represents the Senior Notes Issuer as well
as the creditors collectively (masse des créanciers).


-----

The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for certain acts, such
as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the Senior Notes Issuer during the
bankruptcy proceedings.

Bankruptcy is governed by public policy and rules, which generally delay the process and limit restructuring
options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs.

On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved.

**_Effects of bankruptcy proceedings_**

The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Senior
Notes Issuer, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of unsecured
creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer in accordance with their rank upon the realization of the assets of the Senior
Notes Issuer.

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of
bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial
(intuitu personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by
law, such as employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions
purporting to terminate a contract upon bankruptcy are generally held as being valid. The receiver may choose
to terminate contracts of the company subject to the rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus” and the
creditors’ interest.

Unsecured claims of the Senior Notes Issuer (such as the Senior Notes Issuer’s liabilities under the Senior
Notes) will, in the event of a liquidation of the Senior Notes Issuer, only rank after (i) the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and (ii) the debts of the Senior Notes Issuer that
are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, inter alia:

    - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

    - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

    - social security contributions; and

    - remuneration owed to employees.

    - For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realised
and subject to application of the relevant priority rules, liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law). During
insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer are
suspended.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Senior Notes
Issuer during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by the Luxembourg court
and dates back not more than six months as from the date on which the Luxembourg court formally adjudicates
a company bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days
before the commencement of such period. In particular:

pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some transactions in particular, the granting of a
security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of
the Luxembourg act of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the Collateral Act
2005), the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other
than in cash or by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from inception),
transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into during the suspect
period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside, if so requested by the bankruptcy receiver;

pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other
transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to setting aside by the


-----

Commercial District Court upon proceedings initiated by the bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded with
the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; and

pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code
(action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any
fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to
the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

**Controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée)**

**_General administration of controlled management proceedings_**

The Senior Notes Issuer, which has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) or which is not
in a position to completely fulfil its obligations, can apply for the regime of controlled management in order
either (i) to restructure its business or (ii) to realize its assets in good conditions. An application for controlled
management can only be made by the Senior Notes Issuer.

The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test applied in
bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criteria (that is, the case where a company is not in a position to
completely fulfil its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the Senior Notes Issuer is taken.
Controlled management proceedings is only available for good-faith debtor.

Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not often successful and generally lead to
bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in particular holding or finance
companies, which are part of an international group and whose inability to meet obligations results from a
default of group companies.

The proceedings are divided into three steps:

The Senior Notes Issuer must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District
Court can reject the application because (i) the Senior Notes Issuer has already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the
evidence brought forward by the Senior Notes Issuer does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of
the Senior Notes Issuer’s business or improve the realization of the Senior Notes Issuer’s assets in better
conditions. If the application is upheld at this stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an investigating
judge (juge délégué) to make a report on the overall situation of the Senior Notes Issuer.

Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may (i) turn down the
application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are unlikely to lead to the reorganization of
the business or the realization of the assets in better conditions or (ii) appoint one or more administrators
(commissaires) who will supervise the management of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer. If the Commercial
District Court ascertains that the Senior Notes Issuer is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. the Senior Notes Issuer
has ceased its payments (cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which the Senior Notes Issuer will
be deemed to have been in such situation. Such date may be set up to six months prior to the filing of application
for controlled management proceedings. However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the two conditions for
bankruptcy are met (cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness
(ébranlement de crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either before or after consideration of the
report by the investigating judge or after the reorganization plan proposed by the administrators (commissaires)
at the third step described below. The administrators will draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the
financial situation of the Senior Notes Issuer. They are also in charge of the annual accounts of the Senior Notes
Issuer. The administrators may also prescribe any act they consider to be in the interests of the applicant or its
creditors. The administrators have to be convened to any meeting of the board of managers. They may attend all
board meetings but have no voting rights. They have the right to convene such board meetings.

The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a plan for realization
of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court. The plan shall equitably take into
account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking of mortgages (hypothèques) and privileges
(privilèges) as required by law, without taking into account any contractual clause regarding termination,
penalties or acceleration. The administrators will notify the draft plan to the creditors, joint debtors and
guarantors. Within fifteen days of such notification or publication, the creditors will inform the Commercial
District Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any creditor who abstains will be considered as
having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the joint debtors and the guarantors may submit written


-----

observations to the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court may (i) approve the plan if a
majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at
least half of the Senior Notes Issuer ’s liabilities have agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed by
the administrators even though a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been
challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed to such plan, in which
case the application for controlled management will be dismissed or (iii) ask the administrators to propose an
amended plan (such amended plan will have to be submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving the
plan will be binding upon the company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the
administrators will be fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The
administrators who at the same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees.

**_Effects of a controlled management proceedings_**

As from the day of the appointment of the investigating judge and up to the final decision on the application for
controlled management, any subsequent enforcement proceedings or acts, even if initiated by privileged
creditors (including creditors who have the benefit of pledges (gages) and mortgages (hypothèques)) are stayed,
save as provided for by the Collateral Act 2005. The Senior Notes Issuer may not enter into any act of
disposition, mortgage and contract or accept any movable asset without the authorization of the investigating
judge.

Once the administrators have been appointed, the Senior Notes Issuer may not carry out any act (including
receiving funds, lending money, granting any security, or making any payment) without the prior authorization
of the administrators. The administrators may bring any action before the Commercial District Court in order to
have any act made in violation of the legislation governing the controlled management or in fraud of the
creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to the prior authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may bring
an action (i) to have the managers or the statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District Court
has declared the company to be in cessation of payments, to have certain payments, compensations or security
interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth in Articles 445 et seq. of the Luxembourg code of
commerce).

**_Preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite)_**

**General administration of preventive composition proceedings**

The Senior Notes Issuer may enter into a preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite)
in order to resolve its financial difficulties by entering into an agreement with its creditors, the purpose of which
is to avoid bankruptcy.

Preventive composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial difficulty.
Similar to controlled management proceedings, the preventive composition proceedings are not available if the
company has already been declared bankrupt by the Commercial District Court or if the company is acting in
bad faith. The application for the preventive composition proceedings can only be made by the Senior Notes
Issuer and must be supported by proposals of preventive composition.

The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to verify, and to
prepare a report on, the situation of the Senior Notes Issuer. Based on such report, the Commercial District
Court will decide whether or not to pursue the preventive composition proceedings. If the Commercial District
Court considers that the procedure should not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of
the company (which bankruptcy may also be declared during the preventive composition proceedings if the
conditions for the composition proceedings are not met). If the Commercial District Court considers that the
procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour of a meeting (assemblée concordataire) at which
the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will make its report at the assemblée concordataire.

The preventive composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by their
unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the Senior Notes Issuer ’s debt, has adhered to the proposal and if the
preventive composition has been homologated by the Commercial District Court. Creditors benefiting from
mortgages (hypothèques), privileges (privilèges) or pledges (gages) only have a deliberating voice in the
operations of the concordat, if they renounce the benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in
favor of the concordat entails renunciation. The renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a
portion (but representing at least 50% in value) of their claims with corresponding voting rights.


-----

The preventive composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a pledge and on
claims by the tax authorities. If the application results in a preventive composition arrangement sanctioned by
the Commercial District Court, the preventive composition could still either be annulled (if it has not been
executed) or terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of the company). In such scenarios, the Commercial
District Court may adjudicate bankrupt the Senior Notes Issuer. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the
date of cessation of payment to the date of the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that
date is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy judgment, the court can of course set the cessation of
payment date at six months prior to its judgment.

Preventive composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon secured
creditors.

**_Effects of a preventive composition proceedings_**

The Senior Notes Issuer ’s business activities continue during the preventive composition proceedings. While
the preventive composition is being negotiated, the Senior Notes Issuer may not dispose of, or grant any security
over, any assets without the approval of the delegated judge. Once the preventive composition has been agreed
by the Commercial District Court, this restriction is lifted. However, the Senior Notes Issuer ’s business
activities will still be supervised by the delegated judge.

Except as provided for in Collateral Act 2005, while the preventive composition is being negotiated, unsecured
creditors may not take action against the company to recover their claims. Secured creditors who do not
participate in the preventive composition proceedings may take action against the Senior Notes Issuer to recover
their claims and to enforce their security. Fraudulent transactions which took place before the date on which the
Commercial District Court commenced preventive composition proceedings may be set aside (please see the
bankruptcy proceedings section above).

**_Suspension of payments proceedings (sursis de paiements)_**

**General administration of a suspension of payments proceedings**

A suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) for commercial companies is different from the sursis de
_paiement proceedings available to banks and insurance companies. It can only be applied to a company which,_
as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the
basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments
may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of
reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts.

The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing
financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the
Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors
representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege
(privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)).

The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has lost
its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the debtor prior to obtaining the
suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured claims (by right of
privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned.

**Effects of suspension of payments proceedings**

During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against the Senior
Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer ’s assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred
creditors, or to creditors which are secured by mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral
arrangements governed by the Collateral Act 2005. The Senior Notes Issuer continues to manage its own
business under the supervision of a court-appointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions
carried out by the Senior Notes Issuer.

When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the Senior Notes Issuer’s
managers can run the business again.


-----

**_Judicial liquidation_**

Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies
pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the Luxembourg commercial code
or of the Companies Act 1915.

The management of such judicial liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable
to bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Exceptional measures taken by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in response to the COVID-19 virus_**
**_pandemic_**

It should be noted that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has exceptionally taken, in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, certain measures including a suspension of certain procedural deadlines applicable in civil and
commercial matters. This suspension of delays applies to the one month procedural time-limit for the insolvency
filing obligation provided by article 440 of the Luxembourg commercial code. In principle, such a suspension of
delays should (i) not prevent directors / managers of a Luxembourg company from filing for bankruptcy (if the
conditions thereof are met) and (ii) not restrict the rights of creditors to petition for bankruptcy of a Luxembourg
company. Based on the current legislation, suspension of delays to file for bankruptcy within one months should
remain in place until 30 June 2021.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

_Granting of security interests_

When a Luxembourg company grants security interests, the granting of the envisaged security interests must
comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company must be “in
the corporate interest of the company,” which is a translation of the French “intérêt social,” an equivalent term
to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but
has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable
corporate behavior.”

Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria
(provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective
judgment. The concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate
assets provided by Article 1500-11 of Luxembourg act of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as
amended (the Companies Law 1915). The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will
typically result in liability (personal and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the security provider
concerned. The security interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or
unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed
that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a
company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint
with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder,
a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on
its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him / her. If there is a
misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have
the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null
and void.

The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment
is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company.

_Creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests_

According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae
or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the security interests (such as a pledge) are
situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets.

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of pledges
over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as shares in Luxembourg companies, bank
accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors


-----

located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account
located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over bank
accounts located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of
pledges depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A bank account pledge
agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has
waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank
accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be
required. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of
an enforcement event, including, but not limited:

    - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value
determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties;

    - sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial
terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed
shares) or (iii) by way of a public auction;

    - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations
following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

    - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen,
(ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third
parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges might be
substantially delayed.

The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges and
transfer of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered
into during the hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other
similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of
composition with creditors or reorganisation affecting any one of the parties.

The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor
from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under
the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale
of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in
principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of
law).

Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent
that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions
depending on the type of security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a
financial collateral may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral takers, a fiduciary or a
trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these
third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis
third-party beneficiaries of such financial collateral, persons acting on behalf of the third-party beneficiaries of a
financial collateral, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of
a financial collateral under the Collateral Act 2005.

_Recognition of foreign law governed security interests_

Foreign law-governed security interests (such as the Shared Collateral which are governed by French law) and
the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located
or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized
under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or administrators might not be recognized or enforced
by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to
Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of
the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as


-----

defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests or
arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency
Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the
pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment
or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements,
to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the
pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to
priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable
or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/
arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any
receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets
located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the relevant Luxembourg security provider becomes subject
to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of
the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets.

However, in accordance with article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005, where a pledgor (constituant) under a
financial collateral arrangement is established or resides in Luxembourg, Luxembourg law provisions (including
claw-back provisions) relating to reorganization measures, liquidation proceedings, other situations of
competition between creditors are not applicable.

Article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 applies to (i) Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements and (ii)
any “similar” foreign law collateral arrangement, to the extent that it covers assets (avoirs) within the meaning
of the Collateral Act 2005, i.e. (i) financial instruments and (ii) claims (together, the Collateral Act 2005
Assets), to the exclusion of any other rights or assets.

To determine if a foreign law governed collateral arrangement could be considered (for the purposes of article
24 of the Collateral Act 2005) as a “similar” collateral arrangement (i.e. similar to a Luxembourg law governed
collateral arrangement governed by the Collateral Act 2005), a Luxembourg court (if having jurisdiction) might,
presumably, analyze elements, such as, the main features and effects of such foreign law governed collateral
arrangement taking into account, notably, the scope and type of security (e.g., fixed charge, floating charge), the
nature of the security assets (i.e. whether or not they consist in Collateral Act 2005 Assets), the type of rights
created in favor of a creditor (e.g., personal guarantee or right in rem) and whether a similar type of security
interest may exist under Luxembourg law. Should a Luxembourg judge come to the conclusion that a foreign
law governed collateral constitutes a “similar” collateral arrangement (within the meaning of article 24 of the
Collateral Act 2005), such foreign law governed collateral arrangement would benefit from the abovementioned protection under article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 insofar Collateral Act 2005 Assets are
concerned.

In a European cross-border insolvency context, paragraph 1 of article 8 of the European Insolvency Regulation,
pursuant to which the opening of insolvency proceedings shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third
parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets - both specific assets and collections
of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time - belonging to the debtor which are situated
within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings, should be
binding upon Luxembourg insolvency courts.

Subject to certain exceptions (provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation), in the scenario where (i) main
insolvency proceedings (within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) would be opened against the
Senior Notes Issuer in Luxembourg and (ii) the assets over which security is granted under and pursuant to the
foreign security agreements would be located or deemed to be located within the territory of a Member State (as
defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) other than Luxembourg, the opening of such main proceedings
against the Senior Notes Issuer in Luxembourg should not affect the rights in rem of the creditors in respect of
assets of the Senior Issuer over which security is granted under and pursuant to the foreign security agreements,
in accordance with the above-mentioned paragraph 1 of article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The registration of the Senior Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indentures, the Senior Note
Guarantees, Trustee’s accession deed to the Intercreditor Agreement and the transaction documents (and any
document in connection therewith) (the “Documents”) is required if such Documents are either (i) attached as an
annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes
of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire). In such cases, as well as in case of a voluntary


-----

registration, the Documents will be subject to registration duties payable by the party registering, or being
ordered to register, the Documents. Depending on the nature of the Documents, such registration duties would
be ad valorem (such as for instance a registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts mentioned in those
agreements) or fixed (such as for instance a registration duty of €12 for a pledge). No ad valorem duty is
payable in respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005.
Luxembourg courts or official Luxembourg authorities may require (when these are presented before them) that
the notes, the security interest agreements, the indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and
any document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French
or German.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**France**

Each Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of France with its registered offices or principal
places of business in France. The directors, officers and other executives of each Issuer are neither residents nor
citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of each Issuer or the
French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to
effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of US courts
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of US federal or state securities laws within the United States.
However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or
entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in
Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims
connected with the Notes against each Issuer, each French Guarantor and/or French Individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment
rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US
federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in
France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such US judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings
if such US judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the
following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a
review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

    - such US judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the
dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international
forum shopping), the choice of the US court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not
have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

    - such US judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

    - such US judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e.,
those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such US judgment
should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there
is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the US judgment is sought and
having the same or similar subject matter as such US judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the US judgment will benefit from the res
_judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in_
France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July
16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative US action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the US authorities
would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.


-----

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and
individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information
in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative US action in a discovery
context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated
by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the
application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or
(ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an
action brought in France on the basis of US federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the
requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a
foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to
Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in
connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a
French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction
other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals
is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient
contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may
waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way
of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to
French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person
domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the
privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France,
regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The
French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to
the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent
jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be
binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing
an action before the French courts.

**Luxembourg**

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently
bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards
rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment
of monies rendered by any US Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely
upon the US securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received
such favorable judgment in a US court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by
requesting enforcement of the US judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to
Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the
enforcement in Luxembourg of the US judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

    - the US judgment is enforceable (executoire) in the United States;

    - the US court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the applicable matter under
applicable US Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the US court is
recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; the US court has applied the
substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules according to certain
Luxembourg case law, it is admitted that Luxembourg courts which are asked to grant an
exequatur do not have to verify whether the substantive law actually applied by the US court
awarding the judgment was the law which would have been thus designated;

    - the US judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under
the laws of Luxembourg;


-----

    - the US court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

    - the US judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the
opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and

    - the US judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility
may change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other
conditions may not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future.

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment,
although such a review is not statutorily prohibited.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not bona fide or if
the foreign law was not pleaded or proved or if pleaded and proved, the foreign law was contrary to
Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules, and
(ii) if its application is manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action
brought in Luxembourg on the basis of US federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the
requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give
judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment
against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts
would be converted into euro.

**_For the year ended 31 December 2020 - Page 2_**

_This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditor’s report issued in French and is provided solely for_
_the convenience of English speaking readers. This report includes information specifically required by European_
_regulations or French law. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with,_
_French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France._

To the sole shareholder,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us pursuant to your articles of association, we have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management for the year ended
31 December 2020.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities
and of the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2020 and of the results of its operations for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**Basis for opinion**

**_Audit framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the Statutory
Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements” section of our report.

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the
French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for
Statutory Auditors for the period from 1 January 2020 to the date of our report.

**_Justification of assessments_**

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have
been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures
taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies,
particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future
prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on
the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.
It is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of articles L.823-9
and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform
you of the following assessments that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in our


-----

**FONCIA MANAGEMENT**

**_Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements_**

**_For the year ended 31 December 2020 - Page 3_**

audit of the consolidated financial statements.

The Group tests goodwill and assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis, in
accordance with the methods presented in notes 3.4.5. — Impairment of assets and 4.1.2. – 2020
impairment tests. We examined the methods used by the Group to test for impairment, together with
the cash flow forecasts and assumptions relied upon for that purpose. We further verified that the notes
provide appropriate disclosures. As part of our assessments, we also ensured that the estimates used
were reasonable.

These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole,
and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate
opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

**Specific verifications**

As required by legal and regulatory provisions and in accordance with professional standards applicable
in France, we have also verified the information presented in the Group management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated**
**financial statements**

Management is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements giving a true and fair view
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and
for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or
to cease operations.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Supervisory Board.

**Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated**
**financial statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material
misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance


-----

**FONCIA MANAGEMENT**

**_Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements_**

**_For the year ended 31 December 2020 - Page 4_**

on the viability or quality of the Company’s management.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit.

They also:

  - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

  - obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design

audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

  - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements;

  - assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a
going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are
required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;

  - evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether

these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation;

to the recommendations issued by the French financial markets authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers – AMF) for companies preparing
2009 financial statements, and as described in Note 3.4.1, changes in the value of liabilities relating to put options on non-controlling interests
with no transfer of risks and rewards are to be recognised directly in equity and accordingly, do not impact other comprehensive income.

total purchase consideration of €2.7 million. This acquisition of an additional interest resulted in a reclassification of a negative amount of €0.5 million
between non-controlling interests and equity attributable to owners of the parent. The full amount of the liability relating to the put option granted
to non-controlling interests was reversed.

###### The list of consolidated companies is presented in Note 13.
 External growth investments (acquisitions) 

 The Group continued to pursue acquisition-led growth in the year, consolidating 75 new companies as a result of its acquisitions (versus 65 at 31 December 2019). The companies acquired were mainly French or international companies engaged in property administration (administration de biens, hereafter referred to as property management), with the exception of Yxime, which is active on the property management market. None of these acquisitions are subject to any specific contingent consideration or earn-out clauses. 
 The year’s most important acquisitions concerned the four companies described below. 

 ➢ Acquisitions of companies consolidated in the year
 ▪ Yxime: On 9 July 2020, Esset Management finalized its acquisition of the entire share capital of Yxime SAS from the Duval group, for a total purchase consideration of €24.2 million. This business combination is consistent with Esset’s strategy of strengthening its foothold on the property management market, and particularly the management of tertiary real estate, and of consolidating its regional network. Together, Yxime and Esset are France’s leading property management firm, managing 11 million square metres of tertiary real estate and 20,000 residential lots. 

 The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of this acquisition was still in progress at 31 December 2020. Provisional goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition amounted to €27.1 million at 31 December 2020. 

 ▪ Gérance de Passy: On 21 July 2020, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Gérance de Passy and Sofigest, for a total purchase consideration of €20 million. Founded in 1898, Gérance de Passy is a major player on the Parisian property management market, specialising in the city’s historical upscale 16th arrondissement. Building on its reputation and high-end clientele, the Gérance de Passy group has also successfully moved into managing properties in other arrondissements of the French capital and in nearby towns and cities. Today, the group manages a portfolio of more than 2,700 rented lots and has more than 720 jointly owned properties. Gérance de Passy had revenue of €10.2 million in 2019.

###### This acquisition allows the Group to develop its presence on the premium segment, which offers attractive opportunities provided that the Group’s commercial and marketing positioning can be adapted to meet the specific needs of this clientele. 
 Two new companies were created in connection with this acquisition: Stares group (held by Foncia Groupe) and Stares France (held by Stares group), into which the Group made a capital investment of €15.3 million.
 The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of this acquisition was still in progress at 31 December 2020. Provisional goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition amounted to €21.7 million at 31 December 2020. 
 ➢ Acquisitions of companies carried out late in 2020 and not consolidated in the year
 ▪ Loft One: On 31 December 2020, Foncia Toulouse completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Loft One group for a provisional purchase consideration of €27.7 million. Loft One is among the leading property management companies in south-west France, managing 14,062 rental properties and 38,734 jointly owned properties. This acquisition placed the Group as leader on the local market. 

 ▪ Office des Propriétaires (Belgium): On 11 December 2020, through Stares Orange (its subsidiary created for this purpose), the Group acquired the entire share capital of Office des Propriétaires (OP) along with a 45% stake in OP Property Management (the remaining shares are indirectly held by OP) for a total purchase consideration of €14.5 million. This combination between the Trévi group and Office des Propriétaires will enable the Group to become the leading property services company in Belgium. 

 The acquisition therefore marks a further step in the Group’s acquisition-led growth strategy and its aim to become a leading player on the property services market across Europe. Already the foremost player in France and Switzerland, Foncia is also looking for opportunities that will allow it to step up its growth in Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. 

 The two companies acquired were not consolidated at 31 December 2020. The acquisition value of the companies is shown within non-consolidated investments (see Note 4.5).

 Disposal of Foncia Primaliance 
 On 14 April 2020, the Group finalized the sale of its 51% stake in Foncia Primaliance for €2.3 million. The remaining 49% stake was sold on 22 July for €3.3 million, representing a total sale price of €5.9 million, including a €0.3 million provision for contingent consideration receivable based on 2020 inflows (maximum amount receivable of €0.5 million). 

 In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the Group had classified Foncia Primaliane’s current and non-current assets and liabilities on a separate line of the statement of financial position at 31 December 2019. For the sake of simplicity, Foncia Primaliance was deconsolidated with effect from 1 January 2020. The resulting gain on deconsolidation amounting to €0.3 million is shown in non-recurring operating items.

###### Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic
 The unprecedented health crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic severely disrupted the French and global economies, and the property management sector was no exception, particularly following the lockdowns introduced in France from 17 March 2020 onwards and later between 30 October and 28 November 2020. 

 The measures taken by governments to stem the spread of the virus had a far-reaching impact on the Group’s operating activities during the year. In particular, in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all Foncia Group premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public and to employees for much of the year. 

 This directly impacted the Group’s revenue, margins and operating cash flows. The health restrictions limited activities relating to the transactions and lettings businesses, as well as incidental fees earned on jointly owned properties within and outside France. Despite these difficulties, all of the Group’s businesses managed to continue operating. 

 As from the very outset of the crisis, the Group put in place a series of measures to ensure that it could continue to conduct its business and to protect the health of its employees (and clients) in compliance with government requirements: 

✓ From a human resources and organisational perspective, homeworking was systematically introduced for all

###### employees whose work could be performed from home and who had the necessary tools available. 

✓ From a financial management perspective, the Group swiftly took measures to cut costs and also reviewed its

###### investment programmes. These measures included:
  keeping a close watch on service performance, freezing non-strategic investments and discontinuing any
 temporary employment contracts not deemed necessary to conduct the Group’s essential business;   maintaining a tight rein on administrative expenses. 
 In this context, the Group incurred total costs of €1.8 million (sanitizing gels, masks, etc.) in the period to protect its employees, which were recorded within non-recurring operating items.
 Within the scope of exceptional tax measures introduced by the French government, the Group also requested the earlier refund of its tax receivables and adopted several short-time working arrangements allowed by the government in France and in Switzerland:
 ✓ In France, 2,419 employees were furloughed, primarily in the transactions, digital, and rental management
 businesses. Compensation for furlough schemes represented €6.1 million in the year.  ✓ In Switzerland, the Group was eligible for the Reduced Working Hours scheme (“RHT”), which allowed it to
 reduce or interrupt the working time of affected employees. Unemployment insurance covers 80% of the time not worked, thereby helping to avoid a loss in income for those concerned. Compensation for this measure represented CHF 1.3 million (€1.2 million) in the year. 
 Aid received in respect of short-time working arrangements is treated as an operating subsidy within the meaning of IAS 20 and recognised as a deduction from personnel costs (see Note 5.5). 
 In order to safeguard its independence, the Group did not apply for any government-backed loan (with the exception of the €1.4 million loan granted to its subsidiary Efficity, repaid in December 2020), and made all of its tax, social and operating payments as they fell due. 
 In the context of the crisis, the Group reviewed the assumptions and estimates which were used as a basis for measuring certain statement of financial position and profit and loss items. As a result, it updated the financial forecasting assumptions for its CGUs which are used as the basis for its impairment tests. No impairment was recognised against the Group’s assets as a result of these tests. Note 4.1.2 provides more details on the impairment testing approach.

###### Partial repayment of the shareholder loan 
 On 13 November 2020, the Group repaid €16 million of its shareholder loan.

 Follow-up on the accounting treatment adopted for the Leemo/Primonial partial asset transfer

 By way of reminder, on 30 November 2018 Primonial acquired a 40% equity interest in Leemo (a wholly-owned Foncia subsidiary) via a partial asset transfer consisting of Primonial’s entire, stand-alone sales brokerage division for new and existing properties. Leemo issued a total of 33,624 preferred shares to Primonial as consideration for this transfer. 
 Pursuant to IAS 32, since the basis on which the shares issued could be converted did not represent a fixed basis, the shares did not meet the definition of an equity instrument. Accordingly, they were classified within financial liabilities by default and included within non-current borrowings and debt for €7 million. Until the preferred shares are converted into ordinary shares, they are considered financial liabilities to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with any changes in fair value taken to profit or loss. The fair value of the preferred shares is based on both the estimated value of Leemo and on the expected conversion ratio. 
 The Group is therefore required to assess the convertibility (conversion ratio) for these preferred shares in 2021 based on data for 2020, which depends on changes in the respective contributions of the Foncia Group and Primonial to Leemo’s net revenue. The conversion ratio will be estimated in line with changes in the business contributed by both groups. In the event of an outperformance, Primonial could increase its interest in Leemo to 49%, or a maximum of 48,457 shares, via the transfer of additional ordinary Leemo shares. In the event of an underperformance, the Foncia Group would be eligible for cash compensation of up to €2 million and the shares would be converted at a rate of one ordinary share for one preferred share. Median scenarios also assume different conversion rates that could lead Primonial to hold between 40% and 49% of Leemo’s ordinary shares after the preferred shares have been converted. 
 Based on 2020 revenue figures, Leemo’s performance was favourable to the Foncia Group and (once the financial statements have been approved in 2021), the Group can therefore consider that (i) the preferred shares will be converted at a rate of one preferred share to one ordinary share, and (ii) the Primonial group will be liable to pay the Foncia Group cash compensation of €2 million. On this basis, the €7 million financial liability was reduced to zero against an income entry within non-recurring operating items for €7 million, with €2 million in non-recurring accrued income recognised in respect of the compensation receivable from Primonial. In light of the level of business recorded following the transfer of the division by Primonial, the value of the client relationship was written down in full against a non-recurring expense in an amount of €7 million.

 Accounting standards

 3.2.1. Application of the IFRIC IC’s final agenda decision on the term of certain leases 

 In its 2019 financial statements, the Group had not finalised the analyses and modifications necessary to implement the IFRS IC’s November 2019 agenda decision on IFRS 16 lease terms. As a result, it had adopted a legal approach when calculating the enforceable term of its property leases, as permitted by the AMF in its recommendations for companies preparing their 2019 financial statements. 

 The IFRS IC agenda decision provides clarification when calculating lease terms and applies to commercial leases in France among others: 
 ➢ It reiterates that the lease term used to measure lease liabilities is understood as the enforceable period of
 the lease, since a lease is no longer enforceable when the lessee and lessor are each entitled to terminate the lease without the consent of the other party and without incurring “no more than an insignificant” penalty. Consequently, the lessor’s unilateral right to terminate the lease is not sufficient to determine the enforceable term of the lease.
 ➢ It also clarifies that in order to determine the enforceable period of a lease and assess whether a penalty is
 “no more than insignificant” within the meaning of IFRS 16.B34, companies should consider the broader economics of the lease contract and not only contractual termination payments. The notion of a penalty must therefore include all economic incentives not to terminate the lease. 

 In its decision, the IFRS IC also reiterates that the lease term used to measure the lease liability must be consistent with the useful life adopted for non-removable leasehold improvements. 

 On 3 July 2020, the Board of the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables – ANC) published a new position statement on calculating the term of “3-6-9”-type commercial leases in France. This new statement supersedes the statement issued on 16 February 2018. In this revised statement, the ANC concludes that the lease term should reflect the term during which the lessee is reasonably certain to continue the lease, and that when the legal term of the lease is nine years, the term of the lease is “generally nine years at inception”. 

 On this basis, the Group launched a project in 2020 to review (and re-estimate, where appropriate) the terms of its property leases in light of the IFRS IC’s decision and the ANC’s revised position statement. 

 This project led the Group to increase the lease term for its automatically renewable property leases in France to three years due to (i) the need for the business to continue operating which acts as an incentive to continue the initial lease, but also to (ii) the Group’s strongly proactive and opportunistic real estate strategy in streamlining its property portfolio (notably during restructuring operations resulting from its acquisitions). 

 By way of reminder, the Group had adopted the legally defensible term of a lease in its 2019 financial statements, i.e., nine months at the date of first-time application of IFRS 16 (1 January 2019) and six months at the 31 December 2019 reporting date. 

 Based on analyses performed by the Group of its other categories of leased assets, it did not identify the need to revise the lease terms. This is because the enforceable term of these other leases is generally aligned with the IFRS 16 lease term, since the economic penalties that would be incurred if the lease were to be terminated are insignificant or non-existent.


-----

###### In accordance with IAS 8 and in the absence of any transitional provisions to the contrary, any changes resulting from a final agenda decision issued by the IFRS IC are retrospectively applicable. Accordingly, the impacts of modifying lease terms as a direct result of applying the IFRS IC’s agenda decision were recognized in the statement of financial position with retroactive effect from: 
  the date of first-time application of IFRS 16 (1 January 2019) for leases in progress at that date;  the inception of the lease for new leases, or the date of modification for leases modified after 1 January 2019. 

 The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 were also restated retrospectively to reflect the application of this decision. These restatements are referred to throughout this document as “2019 (restated)”.

 3.2.2. Basis of preparation of financial information
 Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 297/2008 of 11 March 2008, the 2020 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at the reporting date. Information for the comparative period was prepared in accordance with the same accounting policies.  The full text of the standards adopted by the European Union can be consulted on the European Commission’s website: 

 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting_en
 Where there is no specific guidance from IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations, the Group refers to other IFRS standards dealing with similar issues or to the Conceptual Framework, in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 
 At the end of the reporting period, there was no difference between the IFRS used to prepare these financial statements and the standards adopted by the IASB and applicable for the period presented. The Group does not apply IFRS standards that had not yet been adopted by the European Union at the reporting date. It chose not to early adopt the standards, amendments and interpretations not mandatorily applicable at the reporting date. 
 The accounting policies and bases of measurement applied to prepare these consolidated financial statements are described in Note 3.4 below. 
 The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Foncia Management, the entities it controls (subsidiaries) and the entities which are accounted for by the equity method. The financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared over the same period as those of the parent company, i.e., 1 January to 31 December 2020, using consistent accounting policies.

-----

###### 3.2.4. Use of management estimates in applying the Group’s accounting standards
 In preparing its financial statements, the Group is required to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the measurement and presentation of certain assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. 
 Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given the current circumstances. These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. 
 The uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 health crisis has increased the significance of the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the 2020 financial statements. Where appropriate, the Group carried out sensitivity analyses on its key estimates, details of which are reported in the notes concerned. 
 The estimates made by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. 
 ▪ Recoverable amount of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 

 The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. 

 Note 4.1.2 sets out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same note.

 ▪ Measurement of leases

 IFRS 16 requires entities to use certain key estimates, which include:
  whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised;  the lease term;  the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments;  the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the contract.

 The main assumptions used by the Group to prepare its 2020 financial statements are described in Note 4.4.3.

 ▪ Measurement of assets and liabilities relating to post-employment plans 

 The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs.

 Note 4.12 sets out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change.

 ▪ Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business
 combination

 The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. 

 Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount.


-----

###### In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, the Group uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements:
  present a true and fair view of Foncia Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows;  reflect the economic substance of transactions;  are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects.

 Detailed disclosures in this regard are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 Basis of measurement

 3.3.1. Basis of consolidation 
 Details of the main consolidated companies at 31 December 2020 are provided in Note 13 “Scope of consolidation”.
 Controlled entities 
 Companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group is exposed to risks or is entitled to variable returns from its involvement with the entity in question and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Control is analysed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the inputs used to assess control has changed.
 A subsidiary is consolidated as from the date control is acquired, which is usually upon signature of the share transfer and disposal agreements (see “Accounting for ongoing acquisitions” below). Consolidation ceases when control is relinquished. 
 Any interest in the subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recognised within non-controlling interests. Profits and losses and each component of other comprehensive income relating to subsidiaries are allocated to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
 Changes in the percentage interest held in subsidiaries that do not lead to a change in control are treated as equity transactions, since the transactions take place between owners acting in their capacity as owners. The impact of these transactions is shown in equity net of tax and does not therefore impact consolidated profit or loss. These transactions are also shown in the statement of cash flows under cash flows relating to investing activities.
 Investments in equity-accounted companies (associates and joint ventures) 
 Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling those policies.
 A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
 Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s interest in the profits, losses and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. 


-----

###### IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures is applied in order to determine whether the Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures need to be tested for impairment. Where necessary, the total carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets.

 Acquisitions in progress or carried out late in the year 
 Before acquiring shares in a property management company, the Group agrees to acquire the shares and typically pays 10% of the estimated price to the seller. This part payment is included in “Downpayments on acquisitions of securities” within non-current financial assets (see Note 4.5). The remaining 90% is booked under off-balance sheet commitments (see Note 9). Note that at this point in the transaction, the Group does not yet have control over the entity being acquired.
 Upon signing the share transfer or disposal agreement, the Group pays an additional 70% of the estimated price to the seller. The provisional purchase price is then included in equity investments, and the part payment already recognised is also reclassified to this caption. The acquired company is then consolidated. Following a review of the acquired company’s financial statements, the Group pays the remaining balance and adjusts the purchase price of the shares. 

 In the case of acquisitions completed late in the year (generally in November or December), even though the acquired companies may be controlled by the Group, they are not consolidated until the following year, due to insufficient accounting information being available. The investment made is therefore temporarily carried in non-current financial assets at its acquisition cost (i.e., representing the fair value of the investment). The shares are included in “Investments in controlled companies pending consolidation” (see Note 4.5.). No other statement of financial position or profit and loss item is recorded.

 Non-consolidated investments 
 Companies with the following characteristics are not included in the scope of consolidation:

 ▪ they are in the process of being wound up or are dormant;
 ▪ their business is not strategic for the Group.
 In accordance with IFRS 9, non-consolidated investments are carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. There are no material obligations or liabilities relating to these entities.

 3.3.2. Elimination of intragroup transactions
 All intragroup transactions and balances as well as any income, expenses, gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions and included in the carrying amount of assets are eliminated on consolidation.
 When a Group entity carries out a transaction with a joint venture or associate, the related gains and losses are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the interests held by third parties in the joint venture or associate.

 Foreign currency translation
 Presentation currency
 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
 Functional currency and translation of the financial statements of foreign companies
 A consolidated entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the local currency. However, certain entities must adopt a functional currency 


-----

###### other than their local currency when that currency represents the currency of the major transactions carried out by the entity and accurately reflects its economic environment. 
 The financial statements of foreign entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are translated using the “closing rate” method, as follows: 

 ▪ assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate; 

 ▪ statement of profit and loss and cash flow items are converted at the average exchange rate for the period.

 The resulting currency translation differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income within equity under “Translation adjustments”. 
 Goodwill relating to foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro are treated as assets acquired or liabilities assumed and therefore translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. 

 As the Group does most of its business in the eurozone, only its Swiss subsidiaries prepare financial statements in a currency other than the euro. 

 The following exchange rates were used to prepare the consolidated financial statements:

2020 2019


Equivalent to €1


Closing rate Average rate Opening rate Closing rate Average rate Opening rate


CHF (Swiss Franc) 1.0802 1.0705 1.0952 1.0952 1.1138 1.1295

###### The exchange rates used are the rates published by the Banque de France. 
 Foreign currency transactions
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedged rate. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the closing exchange rate, with the resulting gains and losses included in foreign exchange gains and losses under other financial income and expenses in the statement of profit and loss. 
 Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined. 
 Loans granted to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in that foreign operation.
 Translation adjustments arising on monetary items that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (equity) under “Foreign currency translation reserves”, and taken to profit or loss when the net investment is sold.

 3.4.1. Business combinations and goodwill 
 The Group uses the purchase method to account for its acquisitions of subsidiaries. The fair value of the consideration transferred reflects the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed or incurred by the acquirer at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed in the period in which they were incurred.
 On the first-time consolidation of a subsidiary or equity investment, the Group measures all identifiable items acquired at their acquisition-date fair value. The items are measured in the currency of the acquired company. In the event of 


-----

###### deferred settlements, the future amounts payable are discounted to present value at the settlement date. The discount rate used is the same as that used to estimate the value of the assets.
 Fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities resulting from business combinations accounted for on a provisional basis (i.e., because the independent appraisals or ongoing additional analyses are incomplete) are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within 12 months of the acquisition (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Adjustments made after the measurement period are taken directly to profit or loss, unless they are made to correct an error, including in relation to deferred tax assets which, if recognised more than 12 months after the acquisition date, generate tax income.
 Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of “Investments in equity-accounted companies”. 
 Goodwill
 The residual difference representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as goodwill.
 For each business combination, the Group may choose to account for non-controlling interests: 

   - either at acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of goodwill on the non-controlling interests
###### (“full goodwill” method);

   - or based on the share of net identifiable assets of the acquired entity measured at fair value, in which case
###### goodwill is only recognised on the portion attributable to owners of the parent (“partial goodwill” method).
 Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that it may be impaired. The impairment testing approach is described in Note 3.4.5 “Impairment of assets” below. Impairment recognised against goodwill may not be reversed.
 Bargain purchases
 When the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired company exceeds the purchase price plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company, the negative goodwill is taken immediately to profit or loss in the period of the acquisition, after verifying the procedure for identifying and measuring the various items included in its calculation.
 Transactions involving non-controlling interests
 Changes in non-controlling interests that do not result in gain or loss of control are recognised in equity. In particular, when additional shares are acquired in an entity already controlled by the Group, the difference between the purchase price of the shares and the additional share of consolidated equity acquired is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the parent. The consolidated carrying amount of the subsidiary’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including goodwill) remains unchanged.
 Contingent consideration and/or earn-out
 Contingent consideration or earn-outs relating to a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair value, even if it is deemed unlikely they will be paid. After the acquisition date, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration/earn-outs result in an adjustment to goodwill only if they are made within the 12 months following the acquisition date (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. In all other cases, any such changes are taken to profit or loss, unless the consideration transferred is an equity instrument. 


-----

###### The revised IFRS 3 gives certain indications as regards the accounting for contingent payment arrangements with employees or selling shareholders. These arrangements may be part of the business combination or may be considered as separate from the acquisition agreement for the target entity.
 In certain acquisitions, earn-out payments were considered part of the consideration for post-acquisition services rendered and are therefore expensed in the periods concerned and in future periods.
 Business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisitions)
 In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss on the date control was obtained. Goodwill at the date control is obtained is calculated as the fair value of consideration transferred (i.e., price paid) plus the fair value of the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company.
 Put options granted to non-controlling interests
 As part of certain transactions, the Group may put in place options contracts regarding consolidated investments. These may be call, puts or even reciprocal options, which may or not be contingent on certain conditions. Analysing these options contracts is often complex and requires a good understanding of the economics of the transaction carried out, along with the substance of the commitments binding the different categories of shareholder concerned. Options are therefore accounted for on a case-by-case basis in light of all known facts and circumstances. 
 In granting a put option to non-controlling interests, the Group sells those non-controlling interests an option under which they can sell their shares. The non-controlling interests can exercise their put option, thereby requiring the Group to purchase the underlying shares at a specified exercise price and future date.
 In the absence of specific guidance from IFRS, these options are accounted for by the Group as follows: 
  The present value of the commitment at the reporting date is included within “Liabilities relating to put options on non-controlling interests”.  The corresponding non-controlling interests are cancelled. 
 This accounting method does not affect the presentation of non-controlling interests in the statement of profit and loss. 
 Pending completion of the work in progress at the IASB and IFRS IC, and in accordance with the AMF’s recommendations for companies preparing 2009 financial statements, subsequent changes in the value of the commitment are recognised in full by means of an adjustment to equity. When the put option is exercised, the Group derecognises the liability in respect of the deferred payment against the amount of cash effectively paid to the non- controlling interests. 

 3.4.2. Intangible assets
 Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets with no physical substance. 
 In accordance with IAS 38, intangible assets that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost when the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is included as part of the cost of those assets only if it increases the future economic benefits associated with the assets concerned. Other costs are expensed as incurred.
 Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that can be reliably measured, are controlled by the Group, and are separable or arise from legal or contractual rights are recognised at fair value separately from goodwill. 


-----

###### Intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite useful life (software and licences) are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives: 

 Client relationships: 18-21 years Software programs: 1-10 years Other intangible assets: 5 years
 Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. They are included with other assets within cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment using the discounted cash flow method at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. 
 When the recoverable amount of these assets calculated based on criteria prevailing at the acquisition date falls below their carrying amount, an impairment provision is recorded. 

 Trademarks
 Identifiable trademarks are measured using a multi-criteria approach that takes into consideration both their reputation and profitability. 
 The Group classified its main “Foncia” trademark, along with the “Lodgis” and “Trévi” trademarks in Belgium and the “Domicim”, “ Brolliet” and “Gribi” trademarks in Switzerland, as indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 Costs incurred in creating a new trademark or developing an existing trademark are expensed. 

 Business software programs
 Software acquired is carried at cost (purchase price plus ancillary expenses). When allocating the purchase price, certain software programs may also be measured using the replacement cost approach.

 Client relationships 
 Client relationships include the list of mandates managed by the Group’s companies. A mandate is an instrument by which a person (the principal) gives another person (the agent) the power to carry out or enter into one or more legal actions or agreements, in the principal’s name. France’s Hoguet law requires professional property agents to hold a written mandate in order to put properties up for sale or to let, and to manage jointly owned property.
 In the majority of cases, client relationships are acquired separately as part of purchases of business goodwill and are therefore measured at cost. Client relationships can also be identified within the context of major business combinations, when they meet the identification and materiality criteria (in particular, the Group transacts on a recurring basis with the client). In this case, the Group uses the excess earnings method to measure the relationship. It should be noted that given the large number of external growth transactions carried out by the Group, client relationships are only identified and measured for major acquisitions. 

 Other intangible assets
 Other intangible assets mainly comprise the cost of acquiring new business. 

 3.4.3. Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment are measured at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.


-----

###### The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including customs duties and non-recoverable taxes, and any costs directly incurred to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the purchase price.
 Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment or is recognised as a separate component where appropriate, if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group  and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All other maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs incurred to increase productivity or extend the useful life of an asset, which are capitalised. 
 Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the components approach over their estimated useful lives, taking into account any residual value. Straight-line depreciation is considered the method that best reflects the pattern in which the assets’ economic benefits are consumed by the Group: 

   - Buildings: 20-50 years

   - Fixtures and fittings: 8-10 years

   - IT equipment: 4 years

   - Vehicle fleet: 5 years

   - Furniture: 10 years

   - Office equipment: 4 years

###### The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted where necessary. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there is evidence that they may be impaired. 
 Gains and losses on asset disposals are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset concerned.

 3.4.4. Leases

 Group as lessee

 The Group has many leases in which it acts as lessee across its entire French and international branch network. Its leases are of many different types, but are mainly leases of property or vehicles. 
 Pursuant to IFRS 16 – Leases, on entering into a contract, the Group analyses the contractual provisions to determine whether it has the characteristics of a lease. 
 It verifies whether the lease transfers in substance the right to control the use of an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. If these characteristics exist, as soon as the asset is made available the Group recognises:

 ▪ a right-of-use asset, which represents its right to use the leased asset over the lease term; 

 ▪ a lease liability (“IFRS 16 lease liability”), which represents the present value of its obligation to make lease payments.
 The Group applies the same method to account for all leases in which it acts as lessee, and has chosen not to use the practical expedients set out in IFRS 16 exempting short-term leases (i.e., leases with terms of 12 months or less) or leases of low-value underlying assets from the scope of the standard.


-----

###### The amount of the right-of-use asset comprises:

 ▪ the amount of the associated lease liability;

 ▪ plus: 
  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,
  any initial direct costs incurred to obtain the lease, 
  any estimated restoration costs to be incurred by the Group;

 ▪ less any lease incentives received. 
 Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. They are depreciated over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset for accounting purposes, whichever is shorter. 
 The lease liability represents the present value of: 

 ▪ fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; 

 ▪ variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date;

 ▪ amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; 

 ▪ the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option;

 ▪ penalties required for terminating the lease. 
 Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. 
 To determine the lease term, the Group analyses the contractual provisions of the lease, as illustrated below:

 The Group remeasures the lease liability (and adjusts the corresponding right-of-use asset accordingly), when: 

 ▪ there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; 

 ▪ there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate; 

 ▪ there is a change in the lease contract (lease modification) that is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. 


-----

###### When the Group incurs a material obligation to restore the asset to the condition specified in the lease contract, the related costs are included as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability is increased accordingly. 

 Group as lessor
 In certain specific businesses, the Group may enter into lease contracts as the lessor. This is notably the case for German subsidiary Vegis (acquisition carried out in January 2020), which sub-lets – mostly to students – accommodation which the company itself has leased. 
 IFRS 16 first requires the contract to be identified as a sub-letting arrangement in accordance with provisions applicable to lessors, and then to determine whether that arrangement is a finance lease or an operating lease. 
 Classification as a finance lease or an operating lease is based on the right-of-use asset obtained under the initial lease, and not on the underlying asset. To determine whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease, the Group performs an broad analysis to determine whether the contract transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards inherent to ownership of the leased asset to its client (the lessee). 
 To perform this analysis, the Group determines whether: (i) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the client by the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset, and (iii) the present value of the lease payments amounts to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. This will then determine the accounting treatment applicable to the initial lease and to any sub-letting income. The asset recorded in respect of the initial lease is not derecognised and continues to be depreciated. Lease payments collected from the lessee in the sub-letting arrangement are taken to revenue. 
 Based on their contractual characteristics, all of the Group’s sub-letting arrangements meet the definition of an operating lease within the meaning of IFRS 16. The asset recorded in respect of the initial lease is not derecognised and continues to be depreciated. Lease payments collected from the lessee in the sub-letting arrangement are taken to revenue.

 3.4.5. Impairment of assets

 Impairment of assets with finite useful lives
 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment whenever there is evidence that they may be impaired. Impairment recognised in profit or loss against property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be reversed.

 Impairment of assets with indefinite useful lives
 Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that they may be impaired. 
 Cash-generating units
 For the purposes of these impairment tests, non-current assets that cannot be tested individually for impairment as they do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, are grouped into cash-generating units (CGUs).
 Impairment tests are carried out on each CGU or group of CGUs at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.
 A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets for internal management purposes. 


-----

###### The CGUs identified by the Group correspond to its major development and investment strategies. The Group has defined the following three cash-generating units:

   - Property Management France CGU, which includes the management of jointly owned properties, rental
###### management, lettings, the transactions business and client mandates;

   - Property Management International CGU, which includes the property management and transactions
###### businesses in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium;

   - Group of Services CGUs, which includes Constatimmo (brokerage for technical surveys), Assurimo (insurance
###### brokerage), Efficity (property appraisals website), FPM and Esset Management (BtoB property management), Prowen (brokerage specialised in energy purchases), Seiitra (property management software development), Tech-way (technical maintenance), Leemo (property platform), and Lodgis (furnished rentals). 
 The Group decides whether or not to recognise an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities in a CGU or group of CGUs with their recoverable amount.
 Impairment indicators 
 External indicators of impairment include changes in the general economic and financial environment, downtrends in local economic environments and changes in economic performance. These are analysed by the Group to determine whether the assets concerned should be tested for impairment more frequently. 
 Method used to determine the recoverable amount
 An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. 
 The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of: 

   - its fair value less the costs of disposal, representing the amount at which the Group could sell the asset (after
###### selling costs) in an arm’s length transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and

   - its value in use, representing the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the
###### continuing use and ultimate sale of an asset or CGU based on the most probable assumptions adopted by management.
 Fair value net of the costs of disposal is calculated based on available information used to establish the best estimate of the selling price net of costs to sell in an arm’s length transaction between fully informed, consenting parties. 

 Value in use of CGUs or groups of CGUs is determined based on post-tax cash flows resulting from business plans and a terminal value calculated by extrapolating data for the last year of the business plan.

 The assumptions used are based on the budgets and business plans prepared by management for each business. These budgets are the latest budgets approved at the date of preparation of the financial statements.
 Other assumptions affecting the calculation of the recoverable amount include the growth rate, operating margin, the discount rate and the tax rate (see Note 4.1.2).
 The discount rate used to discount post-tax cash flows to their present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Where there is no specific discount rate for the assets tested, the average cost of capital is used. The discount rates are post-tax rates and are applied to post-tax cash flows.  The recoverable amount calculated using post-tax discount rates is equal to that which would have been obtained using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36. 


-----

###### Recognition of impairment losses
 If the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the related assets are written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and then to the carrying amount of the other assets of the CGU, in proportion to their carrying amount. This must not result in the carrying amount of an individual asset falling below the higher of its fair value, value in use and zero. Impairment losses are recognised in other non-recurring operating expenses and may not be reversed. 

 Reversal of impairment losses
 Impairment losses recognised against goodwill cannot be reversed. Impairment losses recognised against assets other than goodwill may only be reversed if there is evidence that the impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist. The amount reversed is then based on revised estimates of the asset’s recoverable amount.
 The increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to the reversal of an impairment loss should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset.

 3.4.6. Trade and other receivables
 Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, corresponding to their face value less any impairment losses recorded in the statement of profit and loss. In view of its business activities, the Group is exposed to limited bad debt risk on its commercial receivables as the risk is concentrated mainly in the B2B business, which accounts for less than 4% of consolidated revenue. 

 3.4.7. Financial instruments
 The measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities is defined by IFRS 9 – Financial instruments.

 Financial assets
 Financial assets include financial investments, shares in companies acquired in the process of being consolidated, deposits and guarantees paid, other long-term receivables, derivative instruments with a positive fair value and cash and cash equivalents. IFRS 9 applies a single analytical framework to all financial assets in order to determine the classification and basis of measurement to be used for accounting purposes. More specifically: 

 ✓ Financial assets at amortised cost

 Financial assets that will be recovered through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) are generally carried at amortised cost. 

 Financial assets at amortised cost include operating financial assets, other loans and receivables and trade receivables. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest rate method. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets at amortised cost are written down by the amount of any expected credit losses. Impairment losses relating to commercial receivables are recognised in recurring operating profit items, while those relating to other financial assets are recognised in financial expenses.
 ✓ Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reclassifiable to profit or loss

 Financial assets that will be recovered both through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) and through sales of those assets are generally carried at fair value through other comprehensive income.

 Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, with the exception of interest income and dividends, which are included in other financial income and expenses. Changes in fair value are reclassified to profit or loss when the assets are sold. 


-----

###### ✓ Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 

 This category includes downpayments to equity investments and investments in non-consolidated companies, and equity instruments that the Group has irrevocably elected to classify in this category. When these investments are sold, the unrealised gains and losses previously carried in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss; only dividends will be taken to profit or loss. 

 Fair value corresponds to the market price for listed securities or to the estimated fair value for unlisted securities, as determined according to the financial criteria most appropriate to the particular situation of each investment. The fair value of equity investments whose price is not quoted on an active market is determined based on the latest known transactions involving these investments. 
 ✓ Assets at fair value through profit or loss

 All other debt and equity instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. These include marketable securities with an underlying term of more than three months, other financial assets held for trading and purchased for sale in the near term, and financial instruments with a positive fair value that are not eligible for hedge accounting. 

 These assets are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value taken to financial income and expenses.
 At the acquisition date, the Group determines the classification of financial assets into one of the IFRS 9 categories based on the characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing the assets. The table below provides an overview of classification by financial asset category, along with the corresponding measurement approach:

**Classification and measurement of financial assets** **Nature of cash flows** **Business model** **Measurement**


Financial investments
Acquisitions of companies in the process of being consolidated
Downpayments on acquisitions of securities


Equity instruments **FV through OCI**


Other long-term investments Equity instruments **FV through OCI**


Deposits and guarantees paid
Other long-term receivables


SPPI Hold-to-collect


Amortised cost


Derivative instruments (positive fair value) NR NR FV through PL

**Non-current financial assets**

Trade and other receivables SPPI Hold-to-collect Amortised cost
Marketable securities
Cash SPPI Other FV through PL

**Current financial assets**

###### Financial liabilities
 Financial liabilities include borrowings and other payables as well as bank overdrafts.
 With the exception of trading liabilities and derivative instruments representing liabilities carried at fair value, borrowings and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method. 
 The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, as appropriate, through a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.


-----

###### Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. 

 Derivative instruments
 The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks on floating-rate borrowings and foreign exchange risks. 

 In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, derivative instruments are measured on the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in the fair value of instruments not eligible for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss under other financial income and expenses.

 3.4.8. Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, as well as short-term highly-liquid deposits with an initial maturity of three months or less and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
 Short-term investments are measured at market value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in market value taken to financial income and expenses. 
 Investments in listed equities along with investments with an initial maturity of over three months and no early exit option are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and classified as current or non-current financial assets. 
 Bank overdraft facilities are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and included in current borrowings and debit. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in profit or loss. 
 For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents include the items defined above, net of short-term bank overdrafts. 

 3.4.9. Client accounts 
 The Group conducts its property management business through mandates signed with clients, under which the companies are responsible for holding client funds. These funds consist of liquid assets received as guarantees, rent and expenses, joint ownership working capital and renovation funds, and funds received in connection with the transactions business. As an agent, the Group undertakes to hold client accounts and to recognise them in its statement of financial position using a specific account for each activity (property sales, rentals and management). The amount shown for client accounts within assets is equivalent to the amount shown for these accounts in liabilities.

 3.4.10. Current and non-current provisions
 A provision is recognised when, at the end of the reporting period, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party resulting from a past event that is likely to give rise to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and can be measured reliably.

 Provisions may also be recognised for contingent liabilities arising on business combinations. In this case, they are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 

 When the Group expects partial or full repayment of the provision, for example owing to an insurance policy, the repayment is booked as a separate asset but only if such repayment is virtually certain. 

 When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision reflects the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligations, as calculated using a pre-tax discount rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and, where applicable, the risks specific to the liability.


-----

###### Since provisions are calculated based on estimated future contingencies and expenses, they are measured taking into account the assumptions deemed most probable at the reporting date. Items giving rise to provisions (trade and employee disputes, etc.) are reviewed regularly to allow for any adjustments. 

 Provisions include amounts accrued in respect of business, employee-related and/or tax (excluding income tax) risks and disputes arising in the ordinary course of operations, as described below:

 ✓ Employee-related provisions (disputes, lay-offs, etc.)
 At the end of each reporting period, a provision is recognised and adjusted in line with the risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Human Resources department on a case-by-case basis.

 ✓ Provisions for rent payment guarantees
 A rent payment guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. Foncia bears the cost of any unpaid rent and advances to owners. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery.

 Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts (deriving from the del credere agreement) and are accounted for as follows:

   - the related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are deducted
###### from rents in the same way as basic fees;

   - once rent is reported as unpaid, a provision is recorded, calculated in accordance with IAS 37.

###### The amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). 

 ✓ Provision for occupancy guarantees
 An occupancy guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. 
 The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days. 

 ✓ Provision for URSSAF social security audits
 This concerns in-progress and completed URSSAF social security audits. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the related risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Payroll department on a case-by-case basis.

 ✓ Provisions for risks on client accounts
 Provisions for risks on client accounts are designed to cover the non-collection risk on lost client accounts in debit, as well as other risks on client accounts. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the risk exposure on client accounts, as assessed by the Group’s Client Operations department on a case-by-case basis. 

 ✓ Provisions for third party and professional liability
 These provisions are recorded based on information provided by senior managers in charge of monitoring claims against their firm. The Audit, Legal and Accounting departments have the final decision in terms of whether or not to 


-----

###### record a provision. If the claim is reported and covered by the liability insurance, the maximum provision will reflect the amount of the deductible (€15,000 as of 1 January 2014) or the amount of the estimated risk, whichever is lower. If the claim is not reported, the senior manager concerned sets the amount to be provisioned. 

 ✓ Provisions for other disputes
 These provisions are intended to cover disputes, litigation and other foreseeable contingencies in connection with the Group’s businesses, along with miscellaneous contingencies and expenses.

 3.4.11. Share-based payment and employee benefits

 Share-based payment
 In some circumstances, some of the Group’s employees may receive compensation in an arrangement involving a share-based payment. This was the case for an employee at Foncia Stark, who was a beneficiary of a free share plan (“AGA”). Due to the existence of a liquidity contract, this free share plan had been classified as a cash-settled plan within the meaning of IFRS 2. The cost of the services rendered had been recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period within production for own use, against an employee-related payable. Since the share-based payment was made to the beneficiary on 23 May 2020 for a cash amount of €200,000, the full amount of the related liability was extinguished at 31 December 2020. The capitalised costs will be amortised as from the date the “Millénium” project (development of new management software for the property management network) enters into service.
 At 31 December 2020, there were no other stock option or free share plans within the Foncia Group. 

 Long-term incentive plans (LTIP)
 As part of its acquisition-led growth strategy and in order to accelerate its organisational realignment, in 2020 the Group appointed a new management team in Germany. The new management team will be responsible for developing the portfolio of mandates managed through selective acquisitions, and for the organizational and operational restructuring processes. 
 In connection with this new appointment, the Group granted a long-term incentive plan with the following terms and conditions: 
  Grant date: 1 June 2020.  Reference period: 2 January 2020 to 31 December 2025.  Performance conditions: LTIP = % performance x equity value, with:

 (i) Equity value = Enterprise value - cash investments made in connection with acquisitions during the reference period  (ii) Enterprise value = 10 x increase in EBITDA during the reference period (iii) % performance = progressive rate (between 3% and 5%) based on revenue earned in 2025. 
 In accordance with IFRS 2, the service cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period against an employee-related payable. The fair value of this liability will be remeasured at each reporting date until the liability is settled, based on assumptions used in the budget. In 2020, the cost of this incentive plan represented €0.3 million, and is shown in non-recurring operating items. 

 Pensions and other post-employment benefits

 ✓ Short-term benefits 
 Short-term benefits include paid annual leave, paid sick leave, bonuses and other benefits (other than contract termination benefits), expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period 


-----

###### during which the employee services are rendered. Short-term benefits are expensed in the period in which the corresponding services are rendered by the employee. Any amounts not paid at the end of the reporting period are carried in current liabilities.

 ✓ Post-employment benefits
 In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which the Group operates, Foncia participates in, or operates, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. 

 Virtually all of the Group’s employees are entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by the Foncia Group to the beneficiaries when the rights allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds financed in compliance with the applicable government requirements and regulations. These plans may be funded by investments in various instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds.
 Post-employment benefits are measured and recognised by the Group in accordance with IAS 19 – Employee Benefits, as described below.

   - Defined contribution plans

###### Defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans are expensed as incurred in the statement of profit and loss based on contributions.

   - Defined benefit plans

###### The cost of defined benefit plans is measured on an actuarial basis. The related obligations are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on the agreements in effect in each company.
 Obligations are determined by reference to assumptions that are revised each year and relate for example to length of service, life expectancy, salary inflation and employee turnover, and also take into account macroeconomic assumptions for the various countries in which the Group does business (e.g., discount rate and inflation rate).
 The assumptions used for 2020 are detailed in Note 4.12. 
 A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position for the difference between the related projected benefit obligation (actuarial liability) and any plan assets as measured at fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses.
 If plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation recognised, a non-current asset is recorded for the amount of the plans in the consolidated statement of financial position. A funding surplus (net defined benefit asset) is only recognised in the statement of financial position if its represents future economic benefits that will actually be available to the Group. When the calculation of the net benefit obligation gives rise to an asset for the Group, the amount recognised as an asset cannot exceed the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the plan or future reductions in contributions to the plan. 
 Expenses under defined benefit plans comprise three components, accounted for as described below:

 - Service cost is recognised under personnel costs within operating profit. It includes service cost for the period, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments, which are recognised in full in profit or loss for the period in which they arose, and gains and losses arising on plan settlements.

 - Interest cost is recognised in other financial income and expenses and reflects the impact of discounting the obligations, net of the expected return on plan assets as measured using the discount rate applied to calculate those obligations.


-----

###### - Remeasurements of the net liability (or net asset) are included in other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss, and do not impact the statement of profit and loss. They essentially comprise actuarial gains and losses, i.e., changes in the benefit obligation and in plan assets attributable to changes in assumptions and experience adjustments. Experience adjustments represent the difference between the expected impact of certain actuarial assumptions applied to previous measurements of the obligation and actual experience.

 ✓ Other long-term benefits
 Other long-term benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19. The estimated cost of these benefits is recognised within non-current liabilities over the employees’ qualifying years of service. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs attributable to amendments to an existing plan or the introduction of a new plan are taken immediately to profit or loss.
 In France, the collective bargaining agreement for the real estate industry stipulates that all active employees who so request are entitled to one month’s salary at every anniversary date: after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of professional experience. Professional experience is considered overall and not as experience solely within the Group. However, the Group is only liable for the amount proportionate to the employee’s seniority in the Group.
 The Group’s obligation under long-service awards is assessed each year by an independent expert. 
 The assumptions used for 2020 are detailed in Note 4.12. 

 3.4.12. Deferred tax
 Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes, using the tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the asset is realised and the liability settled, on the basis of tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 Deferred tax does not arise on: 

   - the initial recognition of goodwill;

   - the initial recognition of an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the
###### accounting profit (loss) nor taxable profit (loss); 

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, to the extent that it is probable they will not
###### reverse in the foreseeable future. 

 Tax on items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income, respectively, and not in the statement of profit and loss. 
 Deferred tax assets arising on temporary differences (after offsetting against deferred tax liabilities) or on tax losses and tax credits carried forward are only recognised to the extent that it is probable they will reverse and that the Group will generate future taxable earnings against which they can be utilised pursuant to local tax laws.
 The following are taken into account when assessing the Group’s ability to recover these assets: 

   - forecasts of future taxable earnings;

   - taxable earnings in previous years.

###### Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.


-----

###### 3.4.13. Trade payables and other current liabilities
 Trade payables and other current liabilities are liabilities to be settled or renegotiated within the ordinary operating cycle or within 12 months following the end of the reporting period. Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (see Note 3.4.7). 
 These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. The value of items that will be paid over the long term is discounted.

 3.4.14. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value
 The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the end of the reporting period, either for accounting purposes or for disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. 
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 IFRS 13 sets out a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value:

   - Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

   - Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
###### liability, either directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., price-based inputs).

   - Level 3: inputs relating to the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable
###### inputs).

 The Group primarily uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, cash management financial assets and identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination. 
 The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 4.18. 

 3.4.15. Assets classified as held for sale, businesses sold or in the process of sale and discontinued
 operations
 IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations sets forth the accounting requirements applicable to assets held for sale, along with the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.
 IFRS 5 requires assets held for sale to be presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial position for the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell, provided that they meet the definition of assets held for sale set out in the standard. 
 When the Group is engaged in a sale process resulting in the loss of control of a subsidiary, the entire assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, regardless of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the subsidiary after the sale. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable.
 The assets and liabilities concerned are reclassified in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, and no offsetting is permitted.
 Businesses held for sale or discontinued are presented on a separate line in the statement of profit and loss for the periods presented, which shows post-tax profit or loss attributable to discontinued operations and the post-tax gain 


-----

###### or loss on the disposal or the measurement to fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups comprising the business sold or in the process of sale.
 Operations that are abandoned or discontinued are defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major line of business and meets the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale or has been sold by the Group.
 Similarly, cash flows attributable to abandoned or discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods presented.
 Under IFRS 5, profits or losses related to discontinued operations are also to be shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of profit and loss, retrospectively for all periods presented. A discontinued operation can be defined as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and:

 ▪ represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; 

 ▪ is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or

 ▪ is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

 3.4.16. Presentation of the statement of profit and loss
 As permitted under IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements, the Group has chosen to present operating expenses by nature.
 “Recurring operating profit (loss)”, “Operating profit (loss)”, “Cost of gross debt” and “Cost of net debt” in the statement of profit and loss and gains and losses recognised directly in equity are presented in accordance with the criteria set out in ANC Recommendation No. 2013-03 issued by the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables).

 3.4.17. Revenue
 Revenue for the Group results from sales of services within the scope of the ordinary operations of consolidated subsidiaries, less revenue from intragroup transactions. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. 
 In accordance with IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, and specific criteria are met by each of the Group’s businesses.

 ❖ Jointly owned property management business

 From a contractual and legal perspective, the Group’s jointly owned property management business is mostly conducted through mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services such as:

 ▪ preparing, convening and organising General Meetings; 

 ▪ managing the joint owners’ council;

 ▪ managing the financial operations and keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association; 

 ▪ managing the jointly owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations; 

 ▪ carrying out periodic visits and inspections of the jointly owned property.


-----

###### All such services are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association. Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognised on a straight-line basis over the period during which the services are provided. 

 Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and disputes. Since each additional service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognised when the service is performed. 

 ❖ Rental management business 

 In its rental management business, the Group acts as agent for owners-lessors and fulfils a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These mainly concern: 

 ▪ routine management services, for example, rent reviews and collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, sending of rent receipts to lessees, and deposits;

 ▪ other one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of documentation, management of claims, administrative filings, and requests for subsidies;

 ▪ technical management services, such as on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys, and preparation of essential information documents for lessees;

 ▪ insurance against unpaid rent; 

 ▪ other insurance such as for vacant premises or property damage.

 These represent separate service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognised separately. Revenue from services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance (falling outside the scope of IFRS 4) is recognised on a straight-line basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue from one-off services is recognised when those services are provided. 

 ❖ Lettings 

 Revenue is recognised at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted. The Group collects fees from owners and from lessees. 

 ❖ Transactions business/Efficity

 Revenue on the transactions business is recognised upon signature of the notarised final sale agreement (acte authentique), which is the date on which control is presumed to have been transferred. 

 ❖ Client accounts

 Interest income generated on client funds is booked in revenue.

 ❖ Assurimo

 Assurismo provides property insurance brokerage services. Revenue under comprehensive property insurance and comprehensive homeowners’ insurance policies is recognised over the term of the cover, since services in this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis. 

 ❖ Constatimmo

 Constatimmo carries out mandatory technical surveys on premises, as well as inventories of premises for lessees. Its revenue is recognised and measured when the related services are performed.


-----

###### ❖ Seiitra

 Seiitra provides specialist IT property services and developed the Thetrawin software, which it markets through the sale of software licenses. These property management tools offer the full suite of functionalities needed to keep accounting records for client accounts and to manage suspense accounts, jointly owned properties and rentals, as well as the budget of jointly owned property associations. Maintenance fees are recognised on a straight-line basis, since the corresponding services are provided over time. 

 ❖ Esset Management

 Esset Management provides property management services (jointly owned property management and rental services) for institutions. The accounting principles applied are the same as those explained above for the private property management business. 

 ❖ Foncia Valorisation

 Foncia Valorisation provides investment strategy consulting and arbitrage (appraisals, lending, block/unit property sales) for institutional clients or wealthy families. Its revenue is recognised upon signature of the notarised final sale agreement and is based on a percentage of the sale price. 

 ❖ Leemo

 Leemo, a wholly-owned Group subsidiary since 2017, is a listing service for properties for sale. It has developed a digital platform for property companies where it lists new real estate projects by different developers as well as certain older properties that are to be made available for sale to private and institutional investors. 

 It derives its revenue from two main sources: 
  fees on sale agreements: amounts billed to developers and partially retroceded to business providers. Only the net margin is recognised in revenue.
  fees on bundles of services sold to developers without any retrocession requirements. 
 Revenue from fees on sale agreements is recognised when the notarised final sale agreement is signed. Revenue from fees earned on bundles of services is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period during which the services are provided. 

 3.4.18. Recurring operating profit (loss)
 Recurring operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, with the exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses)”.
 Recurring operating profit (loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes all items included in operating profit (loss), restated for any non-recurring items.  Costs relating to mergers and acquisitions or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit.

 3.4.19. Non-recurring operating income (expenses)
 This caption includes non-recurring income and expense items that, owing to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as arising in the ordinary course of the Group’s operations and are therefore not reported in recurring operating profit (loss).
 They include impacts of changes in the scope of consolidation, goodwill impairment, and non-recurring amortisation and impairment charged against trademarks and software. If material, non-recurring items also include the effects of certain unusual transactions such as capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring fees, fees relating to major claims and disputes, and any other non-recurring income or expenses.


-----

###### It should be noted that for transactions directly related to external growth and projects to transform or restructure the business (particularly mergers and reorganisations), a detailed procedure is in place to identify, classify and validate any transactions of a non-recurring nature. This procedure gives a precise indication of transactions that meet the criteria to be recorded in this category. 
 During this unprecedented year, the Group was required to purchase protective materials and equipment for its employees and clients. These Covid-19-related expenses are shown on a line within “Other expenses”, which is included in the calculation of non-recurring operating income (expenses). This accounting approach reflects the unusual nature of these expenses.

 3.4.20. Operating profit (loss)
 Operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, irrespective of whether they are of a recurring nature or whether they result from one-off decisions or transactions.

 3.4.21. Cost of net debt
 The cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses incurred by the Group on borrowings and lease liabilities pursuant to IFRS 16, less financial income from cash investments.

 3.4.22. Income tax
 Income tax expense for the year includes current and deferred income tax expense, which are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income. 
 The Group calculates its current taxes in accordance with the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which its earnings are taxable. Current tax expense is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable profit. However, management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax authorities.
 Income tax expense includes the amounts reported by French subsidiaries in respect of the CVAE tax assessed on value added, since the Group considers this tax meets the definition of income tax set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes. 
 When they have not been set against income tax, income tax credits that are not included in the calculation of taxable profit and that are always refunded by the State are recorded as subsidies and reduce the expenses to which they relate.

 3.4.23. Earnings (loss) per share
 Earnings (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) attributable to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period (excluding treasury shares).

 3.4.24. Operating segments
 The Group is not concerned by IFRS 8 – Operating Segments. Revenue is broken down by business in Note 5.1. 

 3.4.25. Statement of cash flows
 Consolidated cash and cash equivalents, changes in which are displayed in the statement of cash flows, are defined as the net balance of cash and cash equivalents, current bank overdraft facilities and bank credit balances repayable on demand that form an integral part of the cash management strategy.

###### Changes in cash from operating activities are calculated based on operating profit (loss) adjusted for transactions with no cash impact.

######  the Gribi trademark for €2.8 million, classified as an indefinite-lived asset to be tested for impairment each year;  deferred tax liabilities relating to these assets for a cumulative amount of €7 million (of which €3.2 million for
 Axium, €2.8 million for Sigla and €0.9 million for Gribi).

 It should be noted that the process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisitions in 2020 of Yxime and Gérance de Passy was still in progress at 31 December 2020. Accordingly, the goodwill currently recognised is provisional.

 4.1.2. 2020 impairment tests
 The assumptions used in the tests and the approach applied are described below. 
 Impacts of IFRS 16 on the impairment testing approach 
 IFRS 16 significantly overhauls the inputs used in impairment tests, including the net amount tested, debt and valuation multiples. It therefore requires entities to reconsider their testing approach. In this regard, several different approaches are consistently accepted by the regulators. 
 The first, which complies with IAS 36, involves increasing the carrying amount of the CGU by the amount of the right-of-use asset, without taking into account the IFRS 16 lease liability. This approach represents a change of practice and introduces a degree of complexity into the calculation of value in use, since (i) cash flows relating solely to fixed lease payments or similar are excluded from the calculation insofar as they constitute the new lease liability, (ii) the cash outflows required to renew the right-of-use assets are to be estimated (future reinvestment flows affecting both the series of annual projections and the terminal value), and (iii) the discount rate is to be adjusted (estimated impact on the WACC of the new cost of capital/cost of debt ratio).
 The second approach is similar to the one described above and involves eliminating the lease liability from the carrying amount of the CGU and from the value in use. This approach leads to similar difficulties as those seen above. 
 The third solution is to maintain the pre-IFRS 16 approach in terms of projecting future cash flows. Although the carrying amount of the CGU changes (increase in the value of the right-of-use asset net of the lease liability), the calculation of value in use is not affected: 
  projected cash outflows relating to lease payments remain unchanged for both the annual forecasts and for the terminal value; 
  the discount rate is determined by reference to pre-IFRS 16 inputs (no change in the cost of debt and the debt-to-equity ratio).

 The Group chose to maintain the third approach for its impairment tests in 2020. 
 Calculation of the carrying amount of CGUs at 31 December 2020 
 Estimating the carrying amount of each CGU includes determining the value of the assets that may be directly attributed or reasonably allocated to the CGU and that will generate cash flows included in the calculation of value in use. However, the carrying amount does not include that of identified liabilities. 
 In 2018, goodwill of €1,094.9 million arising on the acquisition of a controlling interest in Foncia Holding in September 2016 was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used within the scope of the purchase price accounting. 


-----

###### Following the Group’s various acquisitions, goodwill allocated to each CGU can be analysed as follows:

**Goodwill**

**Property**

**Holding company** **Management** **Services CGU** **International CGU** **Group**

**CGU**

Statement of financial position at 30 Sept. 2020 859 395 57 79 1,390

Allocation of holding company goodwill 620 223 15

**Goodwill by CGU** **1,015** **280** **95** **1,390**

###### For intangible assets identified during the purchase price accounting for Foncia Holding and subsequent material acquisitions, the allocation at 30 September 2020 is as follows (based on the carrying amount): 
  Property Management France CGU: €354.7 million to the Foncia trademark, €319.5 million to client relationships and €6.5 million to software;   Property Management International CGU: €21.7 million to the Brolliet, Domicim and Trévi trademarks and €7.2 million to client relationships.   Services CGU: €43.9 million to the Foncia and Lodgis trademarks and €40.8 million to client relationships. 
 The holding company’s residual economic assets following the asset allocation shown above were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU to reflect the cost allocation of the holding company used to draw up the business plans.
 The inputs used to estimate the carrying amount of the economic assets to be tested for impairment are shown below for each of the three CGUs. This estimate is based on the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position as at a date close to the reporting date, showing: (i) the allocation of goodwill among the three CGUs, as presented above, and (ii) the allocation of the residual economic assets.

###### Calculation of the recoverable amount of CGUs at 31 December 2020
 In accordance with the Group’s impairment testing approach, and in the absence of observable fair values in an organised market, the recoverable amount of CGUs corresponds to their value in use, which is defined as the sum of their net cash flows based on the latest forecasts for each CGU, determined using:

 ▪ a business plan prepared by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performance, forecast changes in the economic environment, and expected market trends;

###### ▪ a terminal value calculated by capitalising normative cash flows obtained by extrapolating cash flows from the final year of the business plan, with a stable growth rate or a growth rate increasing steadily over the long term;

 ▪ expected cash flows discounted at a rate determined by reference to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
 The financial forecasts used in the impairment tests carried out at 31 December 2020 were prepared by management and cover a period of five years. They provide a consolidated view as well as a breakdown by CGU. 
 It should be noted that all holding company expenses not allocated in the consolidated business plan were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU. Corporate functions are managed at individual country-level for the Property Management International CGU and are considered not material for the Services CGU. 
 The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated based on a sample of comparable European companies. A WACC was estimated for each foreign country and then for the entire Foncia Group based on a weighting of each country’s contribution to total EBITDA. 

 On this basis, a single weighted discount rate of 8% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs. By way of reminder, a single weighted discount rate of 7.4% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs in 2019. This rate was adjusted in 2020 to reflect the changes in the economic climate.

**Group WACC**

**Cash flows** **WACC**
**Country** **WACC**

**(2020-2025)** **contribution**

France (Property Management + Services) 8.0% 92.2% 7.4%
International 8.0% 7.8% 0.6%

**Group WACC** **8.0%**

###### A long-term growth rate of 2% was used for the tests. This rate was estimated using information provided by public databases such as the IMF and EIU (Economic Intelligence Unit), or by analysts’ reports on companies in the industry or on the economy more generally. A long-term growth rate of 1.8% was used for the tests in 2019. 
 Assumptions relating to the health crisis and result of tests

 Although the health crisis represents a sudden, one-off event, it does not call the Group’s growth model into question. In drawing up its business plans, management expects the wider economic environment to gradually improve by the end of 2021. Based on these expectations, the impacts of the Covid-19 health crisis on business levels and on the profitability of its different CGUs were mainly taken into account in 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021. 
 Based on the impairment tests carried out, the value in use of each CGU exceeds the CGU’s carrying amount and as a result, no impairment needed to be recognised against the Group’s assets at 31 December 2020. 
 The table below presents the values in use obtained for the three CGUs, compared with the carrying amounts of their respective economic assets:

###### Sensitivity analyses:
 As recommended by IFRS, the results of these impairment tests were verified by determining sensitivity to changes in certain inputs:

 ▪ +/- 1% change in the long-term growth rate used in the business plan;
 ▪ +/- 1% change in the discount rate (WACC); 
 ▪ normative EBITDA growth rate. 
 ▪ normative capital expenditure/depreciation and amortisation. 
 The sensitivity analyses show no specific risk of impairment for the CGUs.

###### Trademarks 

 At the date on which Foncia Management acquired a controlling interest in Foncia Holding (September 2016), the Foncia Group and Domicim trademarks were recognised at an amount of €405.3 million based on their valuations. The Group also estimated the value of the Brolliet trademark at CHF 13.7 million (i.e., €12.5 million at 31 December 2020), as well as the Lodgis and Gribi trademarks, at €2.3 million and €2.8 million, respectively.
 Concessions, patents and software 

 Concessions, patents and software include the systems measured in connection with the purchase price accounting for Foncia Group at €5.2 million, as well as the management software used by Lodgis representing €1.3 million. It should be noted that the amortization plan for the remeasurement adjustment recognised in respect of the Thetrawin software (internally developed) was prospectively revised at 1 January 2020 in line with the Foncia Group’s migration to “Millénium”, slated for completion at the end of 2021. 

 Investments in the period totalled €7.6 million and mainly concern Seiitra (€5.3 million) for upgraded Thetrawin modules (Powimo project) and regulatory modules (Thetrawin Legacy), along with Switzerland (€1.3 million), primarily IT capital expenditure at DBS Immobilier for €1.1 million. Other contributors to this item represent investments totalling €0.7 million and relate primarily to Germany.

 Other changes amounting to €6 million chiefly concern the capitalization of assets in progress by Foncia Groupe (ongoing IT projects), Foncia Management (Workday) and the German branch.
 Client relationships 

 Client relationships include the fair value of the mandates held by Group companies, as estimated at the time of the September 2016 purchase price accounting for €460.8 million (carrying amount of €356.7 million at 31 December 2020), as well as client relationships relating to management and architectural activities at Brolliet, valued at €6.9 million in September 2016 (carrying amount of €5.4 million at 31 December 2020). 

 Client relationships also include portfolios acquired since September 2016 as part of the Group’s acquisition-led growth strategy (jointly owned properties and managed rental properties). 

 Other changes reflect the measurement of Sigla, Axium and Gribi client relationships for a total of €26.4 million. Investments in the period totalled €0.9 million and primarily relate to acquisitions of portfolios, in particular Immobiliers Setois, Mazelie and Ethic Gestion. 
 Lastly, the Primonial client relationship recorded by Leemo was written down in an amount of €7 million, as the business has been loss-making since 2018 and its medium-term profitability outlook is particularly downbeat. 
 Other intangible assets 

 Other intangible assets essentially comprise the cost of acquiring new business. The €4.5 million increase in this item during the period reflects the capitalisation of the costs of acquiring new mandates, rebilled to other firms in the network. Decreases totalling €0.8 million relate to the retirement of these costs for lots that were not secured in the period.
 Intangible assets in progress 
 Intangible assets in progress include various Group projects that can be capitalised. At 31 December 2020, the main contributors to this item are Foncia Groupe for €24.6 million in relation to IT projects, Foncia Stark for €33.3 million in relation to the development and roll-out of the Millenium software, and Seiitra for €4 million in relation to the Powimo project. Investments in the period primarily concern Foncia Groupe for €6.1 million and Foncia Stark for €16.2 million.

###### Most leases relate to Group business premises. These contracts are managed using a dynamic approach directly in line with the operating performance of the Group’s branch network and its real estate strategy. 

 In France, around 789 property leases were included in this caption at 31 December 2020 (808 property leases at 31 December 2019), of which around 40% are automatically renewable. The main leases (in terms of rent) relate to the head office at Antony, Foncia Paris Rive Droite at 27 rue de Provence in Paris, Esset Management in Aubervilliers, and Foncia Paris Rive Gauche at rue Raymond Losserand and Boulevard de Courcelles in Paris. Changes in the period can be explained as follows: 
 ➢ New leases signed in France for €28.2 million concern a total of 69 new contracts. However, the five main leases account for almost 67% of the increase in right-of-use assets. These include the new premises at 27 rue de Provence in Paris, representing €12.6 million in right-of-use assets.
 ➢ Changes in the scope of consolidation concern 94 property leases taken on from the various companies acquired in the period, notably Gérance de Passy (€2.2 million), Yxime (€1.5 million) and Prazisa in Germany (€1.1 million). 
 It should be noted that within the scope of its systems development to support the roll-out of the “Millénium” project, in May 2020 the Group signed a framework agreement with BNP Paribas for the lease of Apple equipment (supplies in bundles comprising hardware, software and services, namely AppleCare for iphones, ipads and Macbooks). 

 As the project began to be rolled out in July 2020, this led to an increase of €3.5 million in right-of-use assets at 31 December 2020. The project will be gradually rolled out over the next few years, with the roll-out slated for completion by the end of 2025.

###### 4.4.3. Assumptions used
 The value of IFRS 16 right-of-use assets and lease liabilities is largely dependent on the assumptions used to determine the lease term and, to a lesser extent, the discount rate. 

 ➢ Lease terms generally correspond to the non-cancellable (i.e., contractual) periods of the lease. This is notably
 the case for leases of vehicles, photocopiers and IT equipment, for which no renewal option is generally taken into account. The enforceable period of these leases generally matches their contractual term.

##### 
###### For French property leases, the Group may consider any early termination options (i.e., at the end of the first
 or second three-year period), or an enforceable period that goes beyond the contractual period. This analysis is based on the prevailing operating and strategic environment at the reporting date and is reviewed each year by the Group’s Property division. 
  In the particular case of automatically renewable property leases in France, the Group now analyses the
 broader economics of a lease in determining its enforceable period pursuant to the IFRS IC’s agenda decision. A single reasonably certain term of three years is used to measure these leases. This estimate takes into account (i) the need for the business to continue operating which acts as an incentive to continue the initial lease, but also (ii) the Group’s strongly proactive and opportunistic real estate strategy in streamlining its property portfolio (notably during restructuring operations resulting from its acquisitions).

 ➢ Under IFRS 16, the discount rate for each lease is to be determined by reference to the lessee’s incremental
 borrowing rate. In practice, given how the Group is organised financially, i.e., held or guaranteed almost exclusively by the three French holding companies, the Group adopted an incremental borrowing rate of 3.25% for all of its lease contracts (excluding vehicle leases), reflecting the Group’s own borrowing rate. This rate corresponds to the sum of the risk-free rate and the Group’s credit spread over the initial term of the syndicated loan (i.e., without considering the term). 

 The value of the vehicle fleet in France is estimated based on the interest rate implicit in the leases, as supplied by Arval, i.e., 2.56%. 
 With regard to the other main assumptions and practical expedients: 

##### 
###### The practical expedient exempting low-value or short-term leases has not been adopted by the Group.

  Leases previously classified as finance leases under IAS 17 were classified as finance leases at 1 January 2019. To simplify, the residual useful life of these leases is calculated in the same way as under IAS 17. 
  Restoration costs: 

 - Property leases: restoration costs are only calculated for major new leases, since it is difficult to reliably estimate such costs for all of the Group’s leases, as they are frequently negotiated with the lessor at the end of the lease. 

 - Vehicle fleet: In France, the Group adopted an average cost of €700 per vehicle (cost plus 20% for private vehicles on which VAT cannot be recovered) in measuring the right-of-use asset corresponding to the residual value guarantee. This average cost was calculated based on a market estimate and taking into account the historical cost actually incurred when changing the automotive fleet at the beginning of 2019.
  Deferred tax is recognised on the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability falling within the scope of IFRS 16, in a similar way to that previously recognised for finance leases.
  Services provided in relation to the lease are included in the calculation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on a case-by-case basis and by category of underlying asset. In particular, for the lease contract with BNP Paribas concerning Apple IT equipment, the Group has chosen not to separate the lease components from the service components, and therefore to consider all payments as relating to the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities must be calculated for both leases of equipment and for any services component.

 It should be noted that the Group was not concerned by any lease concessions in the period.

###### Strong seasonal fluctuations at Assurimo mean that it issues its invoices at the end of the year, which explains its very high trade receivables balance. Invoices are settled during the course of the following year. 
 Note that besides fees recognised in revenue for the period, Assurimo’s trade receivables also include amounts to be recovered on behalf of insurers which are paid over to those insurers upon receipt of the corresponding supplier invoice.

###### Output and therefore input VAT (see Note 4.15) increased sharply in 2020, owing to the fact that certain internal transactions were not settled in the year. These positions will be reset in 2021 once the corresponding intra-group invoices have been paid. 
 The €5.4 million decrease in CICE tax receivables is mainly attributable to the 2016 CICE tax receivable owed to Foncia Holding which was collected in 2020 in an amount of €5.8 million.
 Current accounts receivable at 31 December 2020 relate mainly to financing allocated by the Group to companies in the process of being acquired and therefore not consolidated (of which €12.6 million in current account advances granted to Loft One in connection with repayments of its bank debt). 
 Other miscellaneous receivables include outstanding purchase consideration for €0.8 million along with the indemnity receivable from Primonial, for which the Group has accrued a provision amounting to €2 million (see Note 2.4 “Highlights of the year”). This item also includes receivables relating to the Assurance Privilège product for €1.8 million, and advances linked to client accounting (jointly owned properties and managed properties) for €0.8 million.

###### Deferred taxes on remeasurement adjustments 
 Deferred tax liabilities mainly arise from the recognition of intangible assets within the scope of the purchase price accounting for Foncia Management in September 2016. 

 The €7 million decrease in the definitive allocation of goodwill relates to deferred taxes recognised on the measurement in the period of the Gribi trademark for €2.8 million (tax basis) and of Axium, Gribi and Sigla client relationships for a total of €26.4 million (tax basis).

###### Capitalization of non-deducted financial expenses 
 Deferred tax assets were recognised in the period in respect of carry-forwards of interest from the tax consolidation group within the scope of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD I), of which €3.9 million in respect of financial expenses not deducted in 2020 and €3.9 million in respect of financial expenses not deducted in 2019. These deferred taxes were recognised against the taxable temporary difference relating to the Foncia trademark for €354.7 million.
 Tax loss carry-forwards 
 Tax loss carry-forwards within the tax consolidation group at 31 December 2020 are as follows (after utilisation in the current period):

 • Loss arising on tax consolidation: €12.9 million. This tax loss has been recognised in full in view of the high probability that sufficient future taxable profit will exist against which it can be utilised. 

 • Proprietary tax losses of consolidated companies (arising prior to joining the tax consolidation group): €29.2 million, of which €28.9 million not recognised due to the improbability that sufficient future taxable earnings will be available against which the losses could be utilised (of which Foncia Holding for €8.9 million, IDHA for €4.8 million, Syndic+ for €2.8 million and Bourgeois Immobilier for €2.7 million).
 At 31 December 2020, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of tax loss carry-forwards chiefly concern tax consolidation arrangements (€3.3 million), proprietary tax losses of companies in the tax consolidation group (€0.1 million), Efficity (€0.9 million) and Yxime (€1.1 million). 
 Deferred tax on temporary differences 

 Deferred taxes on temporary differences mainly arise on provisions for employee profit-sharing and paid leave, acquisition-related fees, and the tax treatment of translation adjustments. 

 Deferred tax on other adjustments 

 Changes in deferred taxes on other adjustments are mainly attributable to changes in the scope of consolidation (€8.1 million) and reflect the cancellation of existing business goodwill in the individual statement of financial position of companies consolidated for the first time during the period.

###### Bank borrowings 

 The Group carried out several operations on its revolving credit facility (RCF) in 2020: 

 • On 19 and 24 March 2020, the Group drew a total of €190 million on its facility (to secure the Group’s cash resources in the context of the Covid crisis).
 • In June 2020, it repaid the €190 million drawn, which was partially refinanced by two additional drawdowns: €60 million on 19 June 2020 and €30 million on 24 June 2020. These two drawdowns totalling €90 million were also repaid in September 2020.
 • Three additional drawdowns, amounting to €60 million (21 September 2020), €60 million (21 October 2020) and €100 million (23 November 2020) were made and later repaid, on 21 October, 23 November and 23 December 2020, respectively.
 • In all at 31 December 2020, the Group had utilised a total of €120 million of the revolving credit facility, including €20 million drawn on 18 December 2020 and €100 million on 23 December 2020. These two drawdowns will be repaid in January 2021.

 It should also be noted that the full 2018 CICE prefinancing credit was refunded in 2020 in an amount of €8.2 million.

 Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €8 million chiefly result from borrowings and debt taken on from Gérance de Passy (€3.3 million) and Foncia IAG (€1.5 million). Debt relating to Bourgeois Immobilier was repaid in the period in an amount of €1.1 million.

 To mitigate the economic and financial consequences of the Covid-19 crisis, Efficity contracted a government-backed one-year cash loan for €1.4 million. This loan was repaid ahead of maturity in December 2020.

 Liabilities relating to put options on non-controlling interests

 As described in the “Highlights of the year” section, on 25 February 2020 the Group exercised its call option on the Trévi group, acquiring 8% of the shares it did not already own in the group for a total purchase consideration of €2.7 million. The full amount of the liability relating to the put option granted to non-controlling interests was therefore reversed.

 Shareholder loan

 Interest on the shareholder loan is capitalised at a rate of 11.7%. The Group repaid €16 million of its shareholder loan on 13 November 2020. 

 Update on the financial liabilities recognised in respect of the preferred shares issued within the scope of the Leemo/Primonial transaction:

 As described in the “Highlights of the year” section, the €7 million financial liability was reset to zero against income amounting to €7 million recorded in non-recurring operating items (see Note 2.4). 

 4.11.2. Maturity of borrowings and debt

 At 31 December 2020, undiscounted contractual cash flows relating to net debt can be broken down as follows by maturity:

###### The actuarial estimate of provisions for retirement benefits and long-service awards was based on the report drawn up by Mercer and Eactuary, the firms mandated to estimate post-employment benefit obligations for the entire Group. A provision is set aside for all outstanding obligations, estimated based on rights accrued and salary projections, taking into account mortality rates, employee turnover and a discount. 
 For France, the increase in provisions for retirement benefits is mainly attributable to the service cost totalling €1.4 million, reflecting the increase in the net obligation resulting from the contributions of Foncia personnel in 2020. 
 These actuarial gains are recognised in other comprehensive income within consolidated equity net of tax. 
 The increase in obligations in respect of long-service awards can be chiefly explained by the service cost in 2020 (€0.7 million) and by the measurement of employee benefit obligations taken on as a result of the acquisitions of Yxime and Gérance de Passy (€0.2 million). The take-up rate for long-service awards was maintained at 100%.
 Obligations in respect of long-service awards are included within other long-term benefits in accordance with IAS 19. Any related actuarial gains and losses are taken to profit or loss in the period.
 In Switzerland, the increase in the net benefit obligation in the period is essentially due to the service cost of CHF 4.5 million (€4.2 million) as well as net actuarial losses amounting to CHF 0.4 million (€0.3 million).
 Calculation assumptions used 
 Actuarial calculations are based on a number of long-term assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis.

###### Provisions for other disputes 
 In France, this caption relates mainly to the provision for disputes with franchisees amounting to €0.5 million, and to the provision for the Corum dispute amounting to €0.6 million. Outside France, this caption chiefly concerns Switzerland (€1.8 million), where the miscellaneous long-standing risks are monitored by the local management team.

 ▪ Update on the dispute with franchisees

 By way of a reminder, in 2014 franchisees had brought proceedings against the Foncia Group after receiving notice that their contracts would not be renewed. They accused the Group of wrongful termination and various breaches of the franchise agreements. Of the 21 initial lawsuits, the Group either settled (most sensitive disputes), or won (before the lower court or on appeal) the cases. Only seven lawsuits are still in progress following the appeal to the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation). In January 2020, an initial decision was handed down in favour of Foncia Franchise by the court of appeal to which the case was referred after the Supreme Court appeal, in which that court dismissed all of the franchisee’s claims (including those that had been successful in the first instance). However, the franchisee has re-filed an appeal to the French Supreme Court. Hearings are pending before the referral court of appeal for the six other lawsuits (hearings scheduled for between January and April 2021 unless postponed due to Covid-19). Six decisions are pending from the court of appeal, and one from the French Supreme Court.

 ▪ Update on the Corum dispute

 After having terminated its distribution agreement with Primaliance, Corum, a property manager, brought proceedings against Primaliance for trademark infringement for continuing to list the real estate investment trust (SCPI) Corum Origin on its website, www.primaliance.com. The dispute is in progress before the courts. The Group maintained its €0.8 million provision in this respect and did not transfer it to Primaliance when the latter was sold to Bienprévoir.fr. Following some procedural issues in 2019 and 2020, the case is still ongoing and a date for the oral arguments is pending.

###### This caption mainly comprises a contingency provision recognised in relation to a tax dispute concerning VAT arising in connection with the acquisition of Esset Management in 2016 for a total amount of €0.3 million at 31 December 2020. This provision was adjusted in the year and an amount of €0.3 million was written back and recorded within non-recurring items. 
 Provisions for rent payment guarantees 
 The technical increase in these provisions in the period chiefly results from the extension of the “winter truce” (tenant protection period during winter months applicable in France) to July 2020, which automatically increased the average age of past-due amounts owed by current tenants and made it impossible for the Group to bring proceedings against those tenants. New bad debts arising in the period remained broadly stable. 
 It should be recalled that the amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). 
 Provisions for employee disputes 
 In France, the provision remained stable in 2020 at €3.6 million, and concerned 101 lawsuits at end-December 2020 compared to 98 lawsuits at 31 December 2019. Out of the 101 lawsuits, 100 are in progress and 25 relate to amounts in excess of €0.1 million. 

 The increase in the period is mainly attributable to Germany, where provisions were recognised for a total of €1 million in respect of restructuring in progress (notably at Präzisa for €0.5 million and Foncia Deutschland for €0.3 million).

###### Earn-out liabilities 
 An earn-out clause was set up in first-half 2018 with the founders and key managers of Efficity. The additional consideration payable is calculated based on the value creation generated by the business (EBITDA multiple). 
 VAT 
 Input and therefore output VAT (see Note 4.7) increased sharply in 2020, owing to the fact that certain internal transactions were not settled in the year. These positions will be reset in 2021 once the corresponding intra-group invoices have been paid. 
 Outstanding purchase consideration payable 
 At 31 December 2020, outstanding purchase consideration payable chiefly concerns Esset Management for €12 million (Yxime), Foncia Haut de France for €4.1 million (Sigla) and Foncia Toulouse for €2.9 million (Loft One).
 Deferred income 
 This caption mainly concerns Assurimo for €16.5 million. In this insurance brokerage business, client premiums are mainly billed at the end of the year and relate to the following year, which is when they are paid.

###### Accounting for client accounts is a separate and autonomous form of accounting. At 31 December 2019, the balance of client accounts and “Article 55” transaction accounts therefore represents all of the transactions carried out for each client account. This balance totalled €554 million, reported under assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2020. 
 France’s ALUR law requires the use of separate accounts (opened in the name of the joint owners) for jointly owned properties comprising more than 15 main lots as from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, these separate accounts are not reflected in the statement of financial position. The ordinance dated 31 October 2019 now requires separate accounts to be established for all jointly owned properties by 31 December 2020 at the latest. All accounts have been opened, including some just before the end of the year. Consequently, the transfers to certain accounts have not yet been made.
 Note that the statement of financial position does not include any amount for Germany or Belgium, which only use separate accounts.

###### In 2020, the Property management business in France represents almost 60% of the Group’s total revenue. Revenue for the business was up €8.5 million (1.5%) in the period and reflects the following conflicting impacts: 

 (i) the impact of acquisitions carried out in the year;

 (ii) the negative impact of the health crisis on the rental management business (essentially affecting amounts
 collected under commercial leases and incidental fees) as a direct result of the lockdown measures introduced in the second and fourth quarters of 2020), and on incidental fees earned on jointly owned properties (fees on transfer duties, reminders, renovation work and vacancies). 

 Revenue for the Transactions business fell by €4.3 million, due mainly to the impact of the consecutive lockdowns introduced in view of the health crisis, with business volumes slowing sharply in April and May (first lockdown) and then again in November (branches closed) compared to the same period in 2019.
 Despite the impact of the health crisis, the Digital business posted significant revenue growth of €7.5 million on the back of a good performance from Efficity.

###### The €11.2 million decrease in revenue from the “Other activities” segment in France is mainly attributable to the impact of the disposals carried out in 2019 (Foncia Pierre Gestion and the Investor division) for €17.5 million. This impact was partly countered by revenue growth for the B2B business, particularly following the acquisition of Yxime in July 2020. 

 Revenue for the International business grew by €17.4 million and mainly derives from acquisitions carried out by the Group in Germany and Switzerland. Operations in Belgium and Switzerland were also affected by the health crisis, particularly in the Transactions business.

###### Amortisation charged against remeasurement adjustments concerns client relationships for €24.3 million and software for €5.7 million. The €5.8 million increase in 2020 reflects the revised amortisation plan for the remeasurement adjustment recognised in respect of TW software (internally developed) in line with the Foncia Group’s planned migration to “Millénium”, slated for completion at the end of 2021. This increase also results from amortisation charged in the year against client relationships at Axium, Gribi and Sigla, whose purchase price accounting was finalised in 2020.

###### Integration costs mainly concern: 
  HR costs for €15.3 million, chiefly relating to personnel costs incurred by the acquired entities and severance
 costs for certain employees (agreements, bonuses, negotiated termination benefits and payroll taxes); 
  other miscellaneous expenses totalling €8.9 million, including costs related to unlocking synergies (duplicate
 rentals, removal costs, termination costs, IT costs, etc.); 

 acquisition fees primarily relating to fees paid to sellers or business providers for support services, market research fees and accounting, legal and consulting assistance fees. 

 Restructuring costs in France mainly concern the Métropole project, relating mostly to:
  personnel costs including costs incurred in preparing negotiated termination agreements and costs related to
 new hires for certain specific projects; 
  IT and consulting costs incurred in respect of the Métropole project; 
  indemnities for early termination of certain leases along with removal costs.

(1) As indicated in Note 3.1., information for the comparative period was restated further to the retrospective application of the IFRS IC’s agenda decision on

establishing the term of certain leases. These lease modifications only concern automatically renewable commercial leases in France, and increase interest
expenses on lease liabilities in 2019 by an amount of €294,000.

###### Debt issuance costs represent €34.6 million at 31 December 2020, and are recognised over the term of the debt by adjusting the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability to the financial liability’s carrying amount. 

 Additional drawdowns of senior facility tranches B5 in May 2019 (€178 million) and B6 in July 2019 (€110 million) explain the €5.7 million increase in interest on senior facility B. 
 Similarly, the €4.5 million decrease in interest expenses on the ICA second-lien loan is attributable to the Group having made the final repayment on this facility in July 2019. 

 The Group drew down more of its revolving credit facility in 2020 compared to 2019, which explains the higher interest expenses over the year.

###### It should be recalled that following the acquisition of Foncia Holding by Foncia Management on 7 September 2016, a new tax group was formed, effective as of 1 January 2017. The new group opted for a tax loss carry-forward system along the lines of the former tax consolidation group, but with a broader scope. 
 The income tax expense for 2020 is significantly lower than in 2019, at €0.3 million, due to the decline in the Group’s profits amid the wider economic downturn caused by Covid-19. Income recognised for €0.2 million represents tax credits provisioned by Foncia Groupe and Foncia Stark (philanthropy).

###### Current income tax expense excluding the tax consolidation group essentially concerns Brette for €0.9 million. Current income tax expense for foreign companies relates mainly to Switzerland for €0.8 million and Belgium for €0.6 million.
 Net deferred tax income in the period mainly results from the decrease in deferred tax liabilities relating to the amortisation of remeasurement adjustments, along with the capitalisation of tax on non-deducted financial expenses within the scope of Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD I). Changes in deferred taxes in the period are set out in Note 4.8.

###### It should be recalled that since non-deducted financial expenses within the scope of ATAD I may be carried forward indefinitely, they were capitalised in the year (see Note 4.8 on deferred taxes).
 Only non-deducted financial expenses falling within the scope of the new Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD II) are classified as permanent differences. These new tax rules are applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020 (transposition of ATAD II into French law) and concern “hybrid”-type arrangements that generate mismatches in tax treatments between two jurisdictions. As the shareholder loan between Flamingo Lux and Foncia Management falls within the scope of this Directive, 26.25% of interest expenses paid by Foncia Management were added back to profit for tax purposes during the year, i.e., €16.2 million in respect of 2020.

###### NOTE 8. FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE

 Interest rate risk
 The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises mainly on its borrowings. These borrowings are denominated solely in euros and are managed on a centralised basis. They are mainly indexed to 3-month Euribor. The risk management policy is set by management. 

 Cash flow surpluses and working capital requirements for the Group’s companies are centralised under a cash pooling agreement and managed by the Group’s Treasury department. 

 The Group’s Treasury department selects investment vehicles for cash surpluses – either for proprietary cash or client cash (excluding separate accounts) – within the framework set by the management policy, which prioritises liquidity and security. Interest received is indexed to 3-month Euribor or is at fixed rates (term accounts).

 At 31 December 2020, interest rate risks can be broken down by management outlook as follows, taking into account interest rate maturities applied to the asset/liability financing position:

**Credit risk** **€ thousands**
Client accounts 554,011

- Term accounts (client funds) (161,078)
+ Net cash and cash equivalents 51,664
**Assets** **444,597**

 - Credit line (1,872,732)
+ Interest rate cap 660,000

- CICE (8,852)
**Liabilities** **(1,221,584)**

**Net position** **(776,987)**

###### A sudden 1% increase in short-term interest rates applied to the net position of assets and liabilities affected by interest rate fluctuations at the end of the reporting period would result in a rise of €7,770,000 in financial expenses.

 In 2020, the Group still has hedges in place for its credit facilities with an underlying valued at €660 million following the cap set up to fix the maximum 3-month Euribor rate at 1%.

 Foreign exchange risk
 The Group is exposed to two types of foreign exchange risk:

- A foreign exchange risk on assets resulting from the Foncia Group’s shareholdings in its Swiss subsidiaries:

###### although this risk is measured, it is not subject to specific risk management as the investments are intended to be held over the long term. 

 At 31 December 2020, the Group’s foreign currency positions were as follows:

**CHF thousands**
Assets 390,322
Liabilities 271,199
Net position before hedging 119,123
Forex hedging 0
Net position after hedging 119,123
Currency value 0.9258
**Net position after hedging**
**(equivalent value in € thousands)** **110,279**

###### Accordingly, the Group’s foreign exchange risk exposure on assets is not material.

-----

- A foreign exchange trading risk arising on commercial and financial transactions carried out by the Group’s

###### companies in currencies other than their local currency. This risk arises solely on the business of Swiss subsidiaries and concerns the Swiss franc. Since the vast majority of local transactions are carried out in Swiss francs, this risk is not material. 

 It should be noted that Foncia signed an amendment to the agreement for the loan granted by Foncia Groupe to its subsidiary Foncia Switzerland on 29 June 2018, eliminating all repayment clauses. Given that no repayments have been made and that no repayment plan has been set for the foreseeable future, this loan is now considered as a monetary item and as part of the net investment in Foncia Switzerland as quasi-equity, in accordance with IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Since this date, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the loan have been included in other comprehensive income (equity) under foreign currency translation reserves.

 NOTE 10. LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
 Update on the UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) dispute 
 On 1 October 2014, UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) brought proceedings against Foncia Groupe before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance (regional court) seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by lessees of Foncia-managed properties who were unduly charged for receiving notices to pay (avis d’échéance). 
 More specifically, UFC is seeking payment from Foncia Groupe of an amount of €2.30 per month and per lessee over a period of five years and estimates the number of lessees concerned at 318,400, bringing the total damages to €44 million. 
 In its defence, the Group argues that the French law of 6 July 1989 on residential lease agreements, upon which basis UFC filed its claim, made no provision for class actions at the time of the alleged offence; that no law existed preventing lessees being charged for receiving notices to pay; and that this was therefore a lawful practice. 
 Oral arguments were exchanged before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance in March 2018. The decision handed down in May 2018 dismissed UFC’s claims on the grounds that they fell outside the scope of a class action. UFC has appealed the decision and the hearings before the court of appeal have been postponed to 11 March 2021. The Group considers that no provision needs to be accrued in this respect in its financial statements at 31 December 2020.

_This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditor’s report issued in French and is provided solely_
_for the convenience of English speaking readers. This report includes information specifically required by_
_European regulations or French law. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in_
_accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France._

**Foncia Management**
13 avenue Lebrun
92160 Antony
France

To the sole shareholder,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us pursuant to your articles of association, we have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management for the year ended
31 December 2019. These financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on
23 April 2020 on the basis of the information available at that date in the changing context of the
Covid-19 health crisis.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2019 and of the results of its
operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for opinion**

**_Audit framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the
Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements” section of our report.

**FONCIA MANAGEMENT**

**_Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements_**

**_For the year ended 31 December 2019 - Page 2_**

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules applicable to us, for
the period from 1 January 2019 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any
non-audit services prohibited by the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory
Auditors.

**Emphasis of matter**

Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter set out in Note 3.2.2 – Changes
in the accounting standards, to the consolidated financial statements concerning the entry into force of
IFRS 16, which is mandatorily applicable as of 1 January 2019.

**Justification of assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following
assessments that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements.

These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole,
approved in the context described above, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as
expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial
statements.

The Group tests goodwill and assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis, in
accordance with the methods presented in notes 3.4.8 – Impairment of assets, and 4.1.2 – 2019
impairment tests. We examined the methods used by the Group to test for impairment, together with
the cash flow forecasts and assumptions relied upon for that purpose. We further verified that the
notes provide appropriate disclosures. As part of our assessments, we also ensured that the estimates
used were reasonable.

**Specific verifications**

As required by legal and regulatory provisions and in accordance with professional standards
applicable in France, we have also verified the information pertaining to the Group presented in the
Chairman’s management report dated 23 April 2020. Management has confirmed that events that
have occurred and information that has come to light relating to the Covid-19 crisis since the financial
statements were closed will be reported to the sole shareholder called upon to approve these financial
statements.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

**_Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements_**

**_For the year ended 31 December 2019 - Page 3_**

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the**
**consolidated financial statements**

Management is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements giving a true and fair view
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or
to cease operations.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Supervisory Board.

**Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated**
**financial statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of
material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance
on the viability or quality of the Company’s management.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit.

They also:

  - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

  - obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to

design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

  - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements;

**_Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements_**

**_For the year ended 31 December 2019 - Page 4_**

  - assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a
going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are
required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a
qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;

  - evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether

these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation;

  - obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities

or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. The Statutory Auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and
performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed
thereon.

 At 31 December 2019, the Group had collected the full amount of the sale proceeds, presented within “Change in scope of consolidation” in the statement of cash flows (see Note 4.10.4). 

 2.2.2. Reclassification of Foncia Primaliance as held for sale
 Primaliance is a brokerage platform specialising in the distribution of shares in real estate investments trusts (SCPI) and funds (OPCI) and in investment support services. The Supervisory Board authorised the launch of a process to sell this business in summer 2019, considering it a non-core activity for the Foncia Group.

###### It should be recalled that Primaliance had been restructured as part of REIP (formerly Iplus Diffusion) in December 2018. For the purposes of the sale, on 31 October 2019 management spun off Primaliance to recreate it as a subsidiary within Foncia Primaliance, transferring to it the entire amount of Primaliance business goodwill (transfer by REIP of the entire standalone Primaliance business to Foncia Primaliance with retroactive effect from 1 July 2019). 
 Following the 1 August 2019 signing of an agreement in principle with a major asset manager in France and the subsequent confirmation by the third-party buyer of its interest in the operation, the parties signed the preliminary sale agreement on 6 March 2020. This agreement stipulates a provisional sale price of €4.6 million (plus the amount of net debt as of the date on which the deed of sale is signed), as well as contingent consideration of up to €0.5 million based on 2020 inflows. 
 In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the Group presents Foncia Primaliance’s current and non-current assets and liabilities on a separate line of the statement of financial position. Its net assets held for sale were measured at their fair value based on a sale price of €5.8 million. 
 The proceeds from the sale, along with the fair value adjustment to Foncia Primaliance’s net assets in the form of a write-down to goodwill, are included in non-recurring operating items (see Note 5.8):

###### Debt restructuring
 Boosted by continued solid operating performances and favourable market conditions, on 1 April and 3 May 2019, the Group restructured its debt in order to secure additional sources of financing. Details of the debt restructuring are presented below, it being specified that none of the terms and conditions negotiated in these restructuring transactions substantially modify the initial terms of the debt. Based on an analysis of the renegotiated terms and conditions, the initial debt therefore remains unchanged. 

  Increase in the amount able to be drawn down under the revolving credit facility up to €220 million
 An additional €70 million is now available for drawdown under the revolving credit facility, bringing the total amount of the facility (including the authorised overdraft) to €220 million. The applicable terms and conditions for the facility remain the same, except for the maturity of the line, which has been extended by six months (i.e., until 7 March 2023). It should be noted that the maturity of the revolving facility changes in line with the maturity of the senior facility (it will always mature six months before that facility)

###### The fees for this operation represented €650,000. In accordance with IFRS 9, they will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method. At 31 December 2019, the revolving credit facility had been repaid in full.

  Subscription of a new €178 million tranche under the senior facility
 This new line is intended to refinance the full amount drawn under the revolving credit facility as well as the debt restructuring fees. The applicable terms and conditions for this new tranche are closely aligned with those of the term loan B (3.25% interest, maturing September 2023). 
 The fees for this operation represented €3.1 million. and will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method. 

  Extended availability of the capex facility
 This facility is now available until 7 September 2022 (compared to 7 September 2020 prior to the restructuring). However, the maturity of the facility remains unchanged and aligned with the maturity of the term loan B (i.e., 7 September 2023). At 31 December 2019, no amounts had been drawn down under the capex facility. 

  Other amendments to the banking documentation
  Application of IFRS 16 to the Group’s financial reporting and financial covenants.  The free-and-clear (“freebie”) basket under the senior facility now covers €210 million compared to €100 million
 previously, or 1x EBITDA PF LTM.  The senior leverage ratio increased from 5.25x to 5.5x.
 On 31 July 2019, the Group repaid the full €110 million on the second-lien loan, as well as any accrued interest up to that date. This early repayment was funded by the subscription of an additional senior facility tranche for the same amount, i.e., €110 million. The fees for this operation represented €0.8 million and will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method.

 Acquisition of an additional stake in the Initiative et Partenaire sub-group
 On 27 March 2015, the Group had acquired a 45% stake in the property management company Initiative et Partenaire (a former Foncia franchisee) and eight of its subsidiaries for €2.2 million. According to the terms of this acquisition, the historic shareholders had retained a 55% stake but had undertaken to sell all of their remaining shares to the Foncia Group within a three-year period. Reciprocal put and call options had been granted in respect of this transaction. 
 On 22 May 2019, the Group exercised its call option and thereby acquired the additional 55% stake in the company for €3.2 million. This acquisition of an additional interest in the Initiative et Partenaire sub-group led to the reclassification of a negative amount of €0.5 million between non-controlling interests and equity attributable to owners of the parent. 

 Earn-out payment relating to the acquisition of shares in Esset Management (formerly FIPM)
 An earn-out of up to €3 million was granted to the Icade group at the time of the acquisition of Icade Property Management (now Esset Management) on 31 July 2016. The earn-out was based on trends in revenue earned by ESSET with Caisse des Dépôts. This maximum €3 million earn-out had been included in the calculation of goodwill as a component of the purchase price. The final earn-out was settled in February 2019 for an amount of €2.9 million.


-----

###### Acquisition of an additional stake in BimData.io (MovetoBim)
 On 9 July 2019, the Group acquired an additional stake in BimData.io (MovetoBim) through a capital increase subscribed by its subsidiary Immophilae in an amount of €0.3 million. The Group’s interest in BimData.io is now 19.25%. 
 Given the difficulty in compiling and sharing pertinent information, MovetoBIM, a start-up based in Lyon (France) has revisited asset management using Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology, offering asset managers a fully digital, collaborative alternative solution. Since the end of 2015, the company has made available its online tools leveraging BIM technology, a new benchmark in building design.

 Change in accounting presentation for Leemo revenue
 Following the additional analyses carried out by the Group in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 15, in 2019 the Group decided to change its accounting presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to the reclassification of the contracts concerned as contracts where it acts as agent, as opposed to contracts where it acts as principal as was previously the case. Due to this change in accounting presentation, the Group now shows billed amounts net of the costs of fee retrocessions in order to present only those fees attributable to the Group. 
 Since this does not allow a meaningful comparison of consolidated revenue (and the related external charges) between 2019 and 2018, the statement of profit and loss figures for 2018 have been restated accordingly, leading to a negative impact of €14.9 million on revenue as presented. This change in presentation has no impact on recurring operating profit for 2018.  
 It should be recalled that in accordance with IFRS 15, when a third party is involved in providing a separate service, the Group must determine whether it acts on its own behalf (i.e., as principal) or on behalf of another party (i.e., as agent). The Group therefore has to determine whether it controls the specified service before it is provided to the end customer, (for example, when it controls the way in which the third party provides the service). The agent/principal distinction is explicitly based on the notion of control. Based on an analysis of the substance of the contractual relationship between Leemo and business providers/developers, and in particular Leemo’s lack of flexibility in setting its prices, the Group has decided that Leemo acts as agent. 

 NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS

 General principles used to prepare the financial statements
 The accounting policies described in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the standards adopted as described in Note 3.2.2, effective as of 1 January 2019, which include IFRS 16 c Leases.
 The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for assets held for sale and related liabilities, measured in accordance with IFRS 5, and certain financial instruments carried at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9. 
 The consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management at 31 December 2019 were adopted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting of 23 April 2020 and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the General Meeting on 29 June 2020. 
 They are presented in thousands of euros and amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest thousand unless otherwise specified. Consequently, the sum of these amounts may differ slightly from the total amounts reported.

###### Accounting standards

 3.2.1. Basis of preparation of financial information
 Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 297/2008 of 11 March 2008, the 2019 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at 1 January 2019. The full text of the standards adopted by the European Union can be consulted on the European Commission’s website: 
 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting_en
 Where there is no specific guidance from IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations, the Group refers to other IFRS standards dealing with similar issues or to the Conceptual Framework, in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 
 At the end of the reporting period, there was no difference between the IFRS used to prepare these financial statements and the standards adopted by the IASB and applicable for the period presented.
 The accounting policies and bases of measurement applied to prepare these consolidated financial statements are described in Note 3.4 below. 
 The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Foncia Management, the entities it controls (subsidiaries) and the entities which are accounted for by the equity method. The financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared over the same period as those of the parent company, i.e., 1 January to 31 December 2019, using consistent accounting policies.

 3.2.2. Changes in accounting standards
 Main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations in force within the European Union and mandatorily applicable since 1 January 2019
 The accounting policies and bases of measurement used by the Group to prepare its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 are identical to those used by the Group at 31 December 2018, except as described below.

   - IFRS 16 – Leases

###### This new standard entered into force on 1 January 2019 and introduces fundamental changes to lease accounting. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations.
 It no longer distinguishes between operating leases and finance leases. Accordingly, entities are required to recognise all lease obligations in their statement of financial position in line with the approach applicable to finance leases under IAS 17. More specifically, on entering into a lease contract, IFRS 16 requires recognition in the statement of financial position of a liability representing the present value of future fixed lease payments, against a right-of-use asset depreciated over the term of the lease (these rights and obligations were previously reported in off-balance sheet commitments for operating leases).
 The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information. Under this approach, a liability is recognised at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. 


-----

###### All impacts resulting from the first-time application of IFRS 16 were recognised against opening equity at 1 January 2019. The Group does not have any major lease contracts in which it acts as lessor, with the exception of certain intragroup leases, the accounting for which was not significantly impacted by IFRS 16. 
 The amount of the lease liability is largely dependent on the assumptions used to determine the lease term and, to a lesser extent, the discount rate. 
  Under IFRS 16, the discount rate for each lease is to be determined by reference to the lessee’s incremental
 borrowing rate. In practice, given how the Group is organised financially, i.e., held or guaranteed almost exclusively by the three French holding companies, the Group adopted an incremental borrowing rate of 3.25% for all of its lease contracts (excluding vehicle leases), reflecting the Group’s own borrowing rate. This rate corresponds to the sum of the risk-free rate and the Group’s credit spread over the initial term of the syndicated loan (i.e., without considering the term). 

 The value of the vehicle fleet in France is estimated based on the interest rate implicit in the leases, as supplied by Arval, i.e., 2.56%. 
  Barring exceptional cases, the lease term reflects the firm term of the lease, plus or minus the period covered by
 any extension or early termination options. For property leases in France and in particular automatically renewable property leases, the Group has adopted the legally defensible term of the lease, which reflects the nearest date at which the lease can be terminated without incurring any penalties, taking into account a six-month notice period starting at the end of the calendar quarter (i.e., a maximum nine-month term). The lease term is therefore nine months at the date of first-time application of IFRS 16 and six months at the date of preparation of the 2019 financial statements.

 It should be noted that following its meeting of 26 November 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) confirmed its position regarding the lease term and useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements. IFRS IC confirms that the economics of a lease contract rather than just its legal form should be used to determine the enforceable term of a lease. Owing to the late publication of this decision and the time needed to analyse and modify the corresponding estimates, this decision will be applied by the Group in 2020 (the legal approach was maintained to determine the term of property leases). 
 The following other main assumptions and practical expedients were used by the Group: 
  Leases formerly classified as finance leases under IAS 17 continue to be accounted for as finance leases. To simplify, the residual useful life of these leases is calculated in the same way as under IAS 17. 
  The practical expedient exempting leases with a residual term of less than 12 months from the scope of IFRS 16 has not been adopted by the Group.

  Restoration costs 

 - Property leases: restoration costs are not calculated for property leases. As they are frequently negotiated with the lessor at the end of the lease, the costs cannot be reliably estimated. 

 - Vehicle fleet: In France, the Group adopted an average cost of €700 per vehicle (cost plus 20% for private vehicles on which VAT cannot be recovered) in measuring the right-of-use asset corresponding to the residual value guarantee. This average cost was calculated based on a market estimate and taking into account the historical cost actually incurred when changing the automotive fleet at the beginning of 2019.
  Variable lease payments or services related to the lease are not included when calculating the amount of the right-of-use asset or lease liability. 
  Deferred tax was recognised on the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability falling within the scope of IFRS 16, in a similar way to that previously recognised for finance leases.
  The useful lives of non-removable leasehold improvements have not been aligned with the useful lives of the related right-of-use assets

###### The Group has a large number of leases across its entire French and international branch network. Its leases are of many different types, but are mainly leases of property or vehicles.

###### *   Leasehold rights, previously shown within intangible assets, are now included within right-of-use assets. This is
 because they are considered to be costs that were incurred in order to obtain the lease and are therefore inseparable from that lease. The residual value of right-of-use assets is reviewed at least once a year. Assets for which the underlying leases have been terminated are systematically retired.

 **  Equipment held under finance leases, previously shown within property, plant and equipment in accordance
 with IAS 17, are now included within “Right-of-use assets”. No changes were made to the reported amount. 

 Similarly, obligations under leases previously classified as finance leases in accordance with IAS 17 and shown within borrowings, are now included on a separate “Lease liabilities” line. No changes were made to the reported amount.

 *** Liabilities relating to lease incentives, which were previously recognised under property leases, were
 derecognised and included in the calculation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

###### Under the modified retrospective transition approach, comparative periods are not restated. This means that data for 2019 cannot be meaningfully compared with data for 2018. Accordingly, the impact of applying IFRS 16 on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 is described below. 
 Statement of profit and loss 
 IFRS 16 changes the amount and presentation of expenses relating to leases previously classified as operating leases. Under IAS 17, operating lease expenses were included in operating expenses. Pursuant to IFRS 16, these expenses are split between financial expenses and a depreciation charge. 
 IFRS 16 has no impact on the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.

###### The first-time application of IFRS 16 had no impact on net cash flows. However, while payments under operating leases were previously shown within cash flows from (used in) operating activities in accordance with IAS 17, lease payments under IFRS 16 are now to be split between cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability and cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability.

###### In accordance with IFRS 16, repayment of the principal of the lease liability is included within cash flows from (used in) financing activities. Interest paid on the lease liability is also included within cash flows from (used in) financing activities, as allowed by IAS 7 and in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. 
 Consequently, net cash from operating activities for 2019 was €42.6 million higher than in 2018, while net cash used in financing activities increased by the same amount. 
 Statement of financial position
 The new requirements under IFRS 16 lead to an increase in reported assets and liabilities. The recognition of right-of-use assets increases non-current assets by €131.5 million, while the recognition of lease liabilities increases total liabilities by €127.9 million, including a non-current portion of €94.7 million and a current portion of €33.3 million. 
 The Group has chosen to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities separately from its other assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position.

-----

###### Use of management estimates in applying the Group’s accounting standards
 The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the measurement and presentation of certain assets and liabilities and any disclosures provided in respect of contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. 
 Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given the circumstances. These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Where applicable, a sensitivity analysis may be performed if the estimates are material. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 The estimates made by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. 
  Measurements used in testing goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment
 The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. 
 As with any estimate, the assumptions used in these calculations are partly based on uncertain factors and may therefore need to be adjusted in subsequent periods. Note 4.1.3 sets out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same note. 
  Measurement of leases
 IFRS 16 requires entities to use a significant degree of judgement as well as certain key estimates. These involve determining: 
  whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised;   the lease term;  the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments;   the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the contract.

 The main assumptions used by the Group to prepare its 2019 financial statements are described in Note 3.2.2.
  Measurement of provisions

 The Group used the best estimate of its commitments and obligations to calculate the corresponding provisions.
  Measurement of employee benefits 

 The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. 

 Note 4.13 sets out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. 


-----

######  Measurement of fair value (Level 1)

 The Group uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure unlisted derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents (see Notes 3.4.17 and 4.18). 

  Measurement of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax expense
 The Group’s tax position (see Notes 4.9 and 5.11) is based on its best estimate of future taxable earnings.
  Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business
 combination

 The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount. 

  Assessment of criteria for identifying discontinued operations
 In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the Group is required to exercise judgement in determining whether an asset or group of assets meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. IFRS 5 criteria are also used to identify any assets to be classified as discontinued operations. These assessments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in light of changes in the relevant facts and circumstances.
 In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, the Group uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements:

  present a true and fair view of the Foncia Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows;

  reflect the economic substance of transactions;

  are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects.
 Detailed disclosures in this regard are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 Basis of measurement

 3.4.1. Basis of consolidation 
 Details of the main consolidated companies at 31 December 2019 are provided in Note 13 “Scope of consolidation”.
 Controlled entities 
 Companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or is entitled, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity in question and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Control is analysed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the inputs used to assess control has changed.
 A subsidiary is consolidated as from the date control is acquired, which is usually upon signature of the share transfer and disposal agreements (see “Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period” below). Consolidation ceases when control is relinquished. 
 Any interest in the subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recognised within non-controlling interests. Profits and losses and each component of other comprehensive income relating to subsidiaries are allocated to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 


-----

###### Changes in the percentage interest held in subsidiaries that do not lead to a change in control are treated as equity transactions, since the transactions take place between owners acting in their capacity as owners. The impact of these transactions is shown in equity net of tax and does not therefore impact consolidated profit or loss. These transactions are also shown in the statement of cash flows under cash flows relating to investing activities.
 Investments in equity-accounted companies (associates and joint ventures) 
 Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling those policies.
 A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
 Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s interest in the profits, losses and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. 
 IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments is applied to determine whether investments in associates or joint ventures need to be tested for impairment. Where necessary, the total carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets. 
 Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period 
 Non-consolidated investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and mainly consist of shares in property management companies that will subsequently be consolidated.
 Before acquiring shares in a property management company, the Group agrees to acquire the shares and pays 10% of the estimated price to the seller. This part payment is included in “Downpayments on acquisitions of securities” within non-current financial assets. The remaining 90% is booked in “Off-balance sheet commitments” (see Note 9). 
 Upon signing the share transfer or disposal agreement, the Group pays an additional 70% of the estimated price to the seller. The provisional purchase price is then included in equity investments, and the part payment already recognised is also reclassified to this caption. The acquired company is then consolidated. 

 Following a review of the acquired company’s financial statements, the Group pays the remaining balance and adjusts the purchase price of the shares. 

 Non-consolidated investments 
 Companies with the following characteristics are not included in the scope of consolidation:

  they are in the process of being wound up or are dormant;

  their business is not strategic for the Group.
 In accordance with IFRS 9, non-consolidated investments are carried at fair value. There are no material obligations or liabilities relating to these entities.


-----

###### 3.4.2. Elimination of intragroup transactions
 All intragroup transactions and balances as well as any income, expenses, gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions and included in the carrying amount of assets are eliminated on consolidation.
 When a Group entity carries out a transaction with a joint venture or associate, the related gains and losses are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the interests held by third parties in the joint venture or associate.

 3.4.3. Foreign currency translation
 Presentation currency
 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
 Functional currency and translation of the financial statements of foreign companies
 A consolidated entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the local currency. However, certain entities must adopt a functional currency other than their local currency when that currency represents the currency of the major transactions carried out by the entity and accurately reflects its economic environment. 
 The financial statements of foreign entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are translated using the “closing rate” method, as follows: 

  assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate; 

  statement of profit and loss and cash flow items are converted at the average exchange rate for the period.

 The resulting currency translation differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income within equity under “Translation adjustments”. 
 Goodwill relating to foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro are treated as assets acquired or liabilities assumed and therefore translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. 

 As the Group does most of its business in the eurozone, only its Swiss subsidiaries prepare financial statements in a currency other than the euro. 

 The following exchange rates were used to prepare the consolidated financial statements:

2019 2018


Equivalent to €1


Closing rate Average rate Opening rate Closing rate Average rate Opening rate


CHF Swiss franc 1.0952 1.1138 1.1295 1.1295 1.1564 1.1643

###### The exchange rates used are the rates published by the Banque de France. 


-----

###### Foreign currency transactions
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedged rate. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the closing exchange rate, with the resulting gains and losses included in foreign exchange gains and losses under other financial income and expenses in the statement of profit and loss. 
 Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined. 
 Loans granted to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in that foreign operation. Translation adjustments arising on monetary items that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (equity) under “Foreign currency translation reserves”, and taken to profit or loss when the net investment is sold.

 3.4.4. Business combinations and goodwill
 The Group uses the purchase method to account for its acquisitions of subsidiaries. The fair value of the consideration transferred reflects the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed or incurred by the acquirer at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed in the period in which they were incurred.
 On the first-time consolidation of a subsidiary or equity investment, the Group measures all identifiable items acquired at their acquisition-date fair value. The items are measured in the currency of the acquired company. In the event of deferred settlements, the future amounts payable are discounted to present value at the settlement date. The discount rate used is the same as that used to estimate the value of the assets.
 Fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities resulting from business combinations accounted for on a provisional basis (i.e., because the independent appraisals or ongoing additional analyses are incomplete) are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within 12 months of the acquisition (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Adjustments made after the measurement period are taken directly to profit or loss, unless they are made to correct an error, including in relation to deferred tax assets which, if recognised more than 12 months after the acquisition date, generate tax income.
 Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of “Investments in equity-accounted companies”. 
 Goodwill
 The residual difference representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as goodwill.
 For each business combination, the Group may choose to account for non-controlling interests: 

   - either at acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of goodwill on the non-controlling interests
###### (“full goodwill” method);

   - or based on the share of net identifiable assets of the acquired entity measured at fair value, in which case
###### goodwill is only recognised on the portion attributable to owners of the parent (“partial goodwill” method).


-----

###### Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that it may be impaired. The impairment testing approach is described in Note 3.4.8 “Impairment of assets” below. Impairment recognised against goodwill may not be reversed.
 Bargain purchases
 When the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired company exceeds the purchase price plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company, the negative goodwill is taken immediately to profit or loss in the period of the acquisition, after verifying the procedure for identifying and measuring the various items included in its calculation.
 Transactions involving non-controlling interests
 Changes in non-controlling interests that do not result in gain or loss of control are recognised in equity. In particular, when additional shares are acquired in an entity already controlled by the Group, the difference between the purchase price of the shares and the additional share of consolidated equity acquired is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the parent. The consolidated carrying amount of the subsidiary’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including goodwill) remains unchanged.
 Contingent consideration and/or earn-out
 Contingent consideration or earn-outs relating to a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair value, even if it deemed unlikely they will be paid. After the acquisition date, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration/earn-outs result in an adjustment to goodwill only if they are made within the 12 months following the acquisition date (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. In all other cases, any such changes are taken to profit or loss, unless the consideration transferred is an equity instrument. 
 The revised IFRS 3 gives certain indications as regards the accounting for contingent payment arrangements with employees or selling shareholders. These arrangements may be part of the business combination or may be considered as separate from the acquisition agreement for the target entity.
 In certain acquisitions, earn-out payments were considered part of the consideration for post-acquisition services rendered and are therefore expensed in the periods concerned and in future periods.
 Business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisitions)
 In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss on the date control was obtained. Goodwill at the date control is obtained is calculated as the fair value of consideration transferred (i.e., price paid) plus the fair value of the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company.

 3.4.5. Intangible assets
 Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets with no physical substance. 
 In accordance with IAS 38, intangible assets that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost when the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is included as part of the cost of those assets only if it increases the future economic benefits associated with the assets concerned. Other costs are expensed as incurred.
 Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that can be reliably measured, are controlled by the Group, and are separable or arise from legal or contractual rights are recognised at fair value separately from goodwill.


-----

###### Intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite useful life (software and licences) are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives: 

   - Client relationships: 18-21 years

   - Software programs: 1-10 years

   - Other intangible assets: 5 years

###### Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. They are included with other assets within cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment using the discounted cash flow method at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. 
 When the recoverable amount of these assets calculated based on criteria prevailing at the acquisition date falls below their carrying amount, an impairment provision is recorded. 

 Trademarks
 Identifiable trademarks are measured using a multi-criteria approach that takes into consideration both their reputation and profitability. 
 The Group classified its main “Foncia” trademark, along with the “Lodgis” and “Trévi” trademarks in Belgium and the “Domicim” and “Brolliet” trademarks in Switzerland, as indefinite-lived intangible assets. 

 Business software programs
 Software acquired is carried at cost (purchase price plus ancillary expenses). When allocating the purchase price, certain software programs may also be measured using the replacement cost approach.

 Business goodwill and client relationships
 Client relationships include the list of mandates held by the Group’s companies. A mandate is an instrument by which a person (the principal) gives another person (the agent) the power to carry out or enter into one or more legal actions or agreements, in the principal’s name. France’s Hoguet law requires professional property agents to hold a written mandate in order to put properties up for sale or to let, and to manage jointly owned property.
 Client relationships are measured based on the excess earnings method.


-----

###### Other intangible assets
 Other intangible assets mainly comprise the cost of acquiring new business.

 Leasehold rights 
 In light of the legal characteristics of commercial leases in France, leasehold rights (droits au bail) are considered to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. They were previously shown within intangible assets and are now included within right-of-use assets (see Note 3.2.2). The residual value of right-of-use assets is reviewed at least once a year. Assets for which the underlying leases have been terminated are systematically retired.  

 3.4.6. Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment are measured at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including customs duties and non-recoverable taxes, and any costs directly incurred to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the purchase price.
 Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment or is recognised as a separate component where appropriate, if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All other maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs incurred to increase productivity or extend the useful life of an asset, which are capitalised. 
 Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the components approach over their estimated useful lives, taking into account any residual value. Straight-line depreciation is considered the method that best reflects the pattern in which the assets’ economic benefits are consumed by the Group: 

   - Buildings: 20-50 years

   - Fixtures and fittings: 8-10 years

   - IT equipment: 4 years

   - Vehicle fleet: 5 years

   - Furniture: 10 years

   - Office equipment: 4 years

###### The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted where necessary. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there is evidence that they may be impaired. 
 Gains and losses on asset disposals are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset concerned.

 3.4.7. Leases
 Pursuant to IFRS 16 – Leases, on entering into a contract, the Group analyses the contractual provisions to determine whether it has the characteristics of a lease. 
 It verifies whether the lease transfers in substance the right to control the use of an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. If these characteristics exist, as soon as the asset is made available the Group recognises:

  a right-of-use asset, which represents its right to use the leased asset over the lease term; 

  a lease liability which represents its obligation to make lease payments


-----

###### The Group applies the same method to account for all leases in which it acts as lessee, and has chosen not to use the practical expedients set out in IFRS 16 exempting short-term leases (i.e., leases with terms of 12 months or less) or leases of low-value underlying assets from the scope of the standard.
 The amount of the right-of-use asset comprises:

  the amount of the associated lease liability;

  plus: 
  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,
  any initial direct costs incurred to obtain the lease, 
  any estimated restoration costs to be incurred by the Group;

  less any lease incentives received. 
 Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. They are depreciated over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset for accounting purposes, whichever is shorter. 
 The lease liability represents the present value of: 

  fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; 

  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date;

  amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; 

  the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option;

  penalties required for terminating the lease. 
 Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. 
 To determine the lease term, the Group analyses the contractual provisions of the lease, as illustrated below:


-----

###### The Group remeasures the lease liability (and adjusts the corresponding right-of-use asset accordingly), when: 

  there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; 

  there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate; 

  there is a change in the lease contract (lease modification) that is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. 
 When the Group incurs an obligation to restore the asset to the condition specified in the lease contract, the related costs are included as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability is increased accordingly. 
 IFRS 16 offers a practical expedient to lessees whereby they may choose not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group did not apply this practical expedient in its 2019 financial statements. 

 3.4.8. Impairment of assets

 Impairment of assets with finite useful lives
 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment whenever there is evidence that they may be impaired. Impairment recognised in profit or loss against property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be reversed.

 Impairment of assets with indefinite useful lives
 Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that they may be impaired. 
 Cash-generating units
 For the purposes of these impairment tests, non-current assets that cannot be tested individually for impairment as they do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, are grouped into cash-generating units (CGUs).
 Impairment tests are carried out on each CGU or group of CGUs at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.
 A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets for internal management purposes. 
 The CGUs identified by the Group correspond to its major development and investment strategies. The Group has defined the following three cash-generating units:

   - Property Management France CGU, which includes the management of jointly owned properties, rental
###### management, lettings, the transactions business and client mandates.

   - Property Management International CGU, which includes the property management and transactions
###### businesses in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.


-----

   - Services CGU, which includes Constatimmo (brokerage for technical surveys), Assurimo (insurance
###### brokerage), Efficity (property appraisals website), FPM and Esset Management (BtoB property management), Prowen (brokerage specialised in energy purchases), Seiitra (property management software development), Techway (technical maintenance), Leemo (property platform), and Lodgis (furnished rentals).
 The Group decides whether or not to recognise an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities in a CGU or group of CGUs with their recoverable amount.
 Impairment indicators 
 External indicators of impairment include changes in the general economic and financial environment, downtrends in local economic environments and changes in economic performance. These are analysed by the Group to determine whether the assets concerned should be tested for impairment more frequently. 

 Method used to determine the recoverable amount
 An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. 
 The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of: 

   - its fair value less the costs of disposal, representing the amount at which the Group could sell the asset (after
###### selling costs) in an arm’s length transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and

   - its value in use, representing the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the
###### continuing use and ultimate sale of an asset or CGU based on the most probable assumptions adopted by management.

 Fair value net of the costs of disposal is calculated based on available information used to establish the best estimate of the selling price net of costs to sell in an arm’s length transaction between fully informed, consenting parties. 

 Value in use of CGUs or groups of CGUs is determined based on post-tax cash flows resulting from business plans and a terminal value calculated by extrapolating data for the last year of the business plan.

 The assumptions used are based on the budgets and business plans prepared by management for each business. These budgets are the latest budgets approved by the Supervisory Board at the date of preparation of the financial statements. 
 Other assumptions affecting the calculation of the recoverable amount include the growth rate, operating margin, the discount rate and the tax rate (see Note 4.1).
 The discount rate used to discount post-tax cash flows to their present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Where there is no specific discount rate for the assets tested, the average cost of capital is used. The discount rates are post-tax rates and are applied to post-tax cash flows. The recoverable amount calculated using post-tax discount rates is equal to that which would have been obtained using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36. 

 Recognition of impairment losses
 If the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the related assets are written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and then to the carrying amount of the other assets of the CGU, in proportion to their carrying amount. This must not result in the carrying amount of an individual asset falling below the higher of its fair value, value in use and zero. Impairment losses are recognised in other operating expenses and may not be reversed. 


-----

###### Reversal of impairment losses
 Impairment losses recognised against goodwill cannot be reversed. Impairment losses recognised against assets other than goodwill may only be reversed if there is evidence that the impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist. The amount reversed is then based on revised estimates of the asset’s recoverable amount. 
 The increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to the reversal of an impairment loss should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset. 

 3.4.9. Trade and other receivables
 Trade and other receivables are initially carried at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment losses recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

 3.4.10. Financial instruments
 The measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities is defined by IFRS 9 – Financial instruments.

 Financial assets
 Financial assets include loans and receivables, liquid assets, financial assets relating to financing, other financial assets, derivative instruments with a positive fair value and cash and cash equivalents. 
 IFRS 9 applies a single analytical framework to all financial assets in order to determine the classification and basis of measurement to be used for accounting purposes. More specifically: 

  Financial assets at amortised cost

 Financial assets that will be recovered through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) are generally carried at amortised cost. 

 Financial assets at amortised cost include operating financial assets, other loans and receivables and trade receivables. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest rate method. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets at amortised cost are written down by the amount of any expected credit losses. The impairment loss is recorded either in recurring operating profit or in other financial income and expenses.
  Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reclassifiable to profit or loss

 Financial assets that will be recovered both through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) and through sales of those assets are generally carried at fair value through other comprehensive income.

 Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, with the exception of interest income and dividends, which are included in other financial income and expenses. Changes in fair value are reclassified to profit or loss when the assets are sold. 
  Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss 

 This category includes investments in non-consolidated companies and equity instruments that the Group has irrevocably elected to classify in this category. When these investments are sold, the unrealised gains and losses previously carried in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss; only dividends will be taken to profit or loss. 

 Fair value corresponds to the market price for listed securities or to the estimated fair value for unlisted securities, as determined according to the financial criteria most appropriate to the particular situation of each investment. Equity investments for which prices are not quoted on an active market and for which fair


-----

###### value cannot be reliably measured are carried by the Group at historical cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
  Assets at fair value through profit or loss

 All other debt and equity instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. These include marketable securities with an underlying term of more than three months, other financial assets held for trading and purchased for sale in the near term, and financial instruments with a positive fair value that are not eligible for hedge accounting. 

 These assets are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value taken to financial income and expenses.
 At the acquisition date, the Group determines the classification of financial assets into one of the IFRS 9 categories based on the characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing the assets. The table below provides an overview of classification by financial asset category, along with the corresponding measurement approach:

###### Financial liabilities
 Financial liabilities include borrowings, other financing and overdraft facilities, and derivative instruments with a negative fair value. 
 With the exception of trading liabilities and derivative instruments representing liabilities carried at fair value, borrowings and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method. 
 The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, as appropriate, through a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
 Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. 


-----

###### Derivative instruments
 The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks on floating-rate borrowings and foreign exchange risks. 
 In accordance with IFRS, hedge accounting may be applied to a hedging transaction provided that:

   - the hedge is documented (entity’s objectives, hedging strategy, identification of the components of the
###### hedging relationship, etc.);

   - the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
###### A hedge is highly effective if it meets all of the following hedge effectiveness criteria:

 - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument,

 - the credit risk is not of a magnitude that it dominates the value changes that result from the economic relationship,

 - the hedge ratio is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item;

   - effectiveness can be measured reliably and is calculated in the context of continuing operations.

###### For the periods presented, no interest rate or foreign currency derivatives used by the Group are classified as hedging instruments. 

 In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, derivative instruments are measured on the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in the fair value of instruments not eligible for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss under other financial income and expenses.

 3.4.11. Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, as well as short-term highly-liquid deposits with an initial maturity of three months or less and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
 Short-term investments are measured at market value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in market value taken to financial income and expenses. 
 Investments in listed equities, investments with an initial maturity of over three months and no early exit option and restricted (i.e., blocked) bank accounts are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and classified as current or non-current financial assets. 
 Bank overdraft facilities are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and included in current financial liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in profit or loss. 
 For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents include the items defined above, net of short-term bank overdrafts. 


-----

###### 3.4.12. Client accounts 
 The Group conducts its property management business through mandates signed with clients, under which the companies are responsible for holding client funds. These funds consist of guarantee deposits received, rent and expenses, joint ownership working capital and renovation funds, and funds received in connection with the transactions business. As an agent, the Group undertakes to hold client accounts and to recognise them in its statement of financial position using a specific account for each activity (property sales, rentals and management).

 3.4.13. Current and non-current provisions
 A provision is recognised when, at the end of the reporting period, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party resulting from a past event that is likely to give rise to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and can be measured reliably.

 Provisions may also be recognised for contingent liabilities arising on business combinations. In this case, they are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 

 When the Group expects partial or full repayment of the provision, for example owing to an insurance policy, the repayment is booked as a separate asset but only if such repayment is virtually certain. 

 When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision reflects the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligations, as calculated using a pre-tax discount rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and, where applicable, the risks specific to the liability.

 Since provisions are calculated based on estimated future contingencies and expenses, they are measured taking into account the assumptions deemed most probable at the reporting date. Items giving rise to provisions (trade and employee disputes, etc.) are reviewed regularly to allow for any adjustments. 

 Provisions include amounts accrued in respect of business, employee-related and/or tax (excluding income tax) risks and disputes arising in the ordinary course of operations, as described below:

  Employee-related provisions (disputes, lay-offs, etc.)
 At the end of each reporting period, a provision is recognised and adjusted in line with the risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Human Resources department on a case-by-case basis.

  Provisions for rent payment guarantees
 A rent payment guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. Foncia bears the cost of any unpaid rent and advances to owners. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery.

 Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts (deriving from the del credere agreement) and are accounted for as follows:

   - the related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are
###### deducted from rents in the same way as basic fees;

   - once rent is reported as unpaid, a provision is recorded, calculated in accordance with IAS 37.

###### The amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). 


-----

######  Provision for occupancy guarantees
 An occupancy guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. 
 The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days. 

  Provision for URSSAF social security audits
 This concerns in-progress and completed URSSAF social security audits. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the related risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Payroll department on a case-by-case basis.

  Provisions for risks on client accounts
 Provisions for risks on client accounts are designed to cover the non-collection risk on lost client accounts in debit, as well as other risks on client accounts. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the risk exposure on client accounts, as assessed by the Group’s Client Operations department on a case-by-case basis. 

  Provisions for third party and professional liability
 These provisions are recorded based on information provided by senior managers in charge of monitoring claims against their firm. The Audit, Legal and Accounting departments have the final decision in terms of whether or not to record a provision. If the claim is reported and covered by the liability insurance, the maximum provision will reflect the amount of the deductible (€15,000 as of 1 January 2014) or the amount of the estimated risk, whichever is lower. If the claim is not reported, the senior manager concerned sets the amount to be provisioned. 

  Provisions for other disputes
 These provisions are intended to cover disputes, litigation and other foreseeable contingencies in connection with the Group’s businesses, along with miscellaneous contingencies and expenses.

 3.4.14. Share-based payment and employee benefits

 Share-based payment
 A free share plan was set up for certain Foncia Stark employees, who will receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments. 

 The main characteristics of this plan are as follows: 

   - Grant date: 23 May 2018.

   - Date on which the continuing employment condition is assessed: 23 May 2020.

   - Vesting period for the shares: between 23 May 2018 and 23 May 2020.

   - Maximum number of shares awarded: up to 205,000 free shares in the company, representing 5.125% of its
###### share capital. 

   - Maximum aggregate amount of the free share plan: €410,000.

   - The shares awarded are monetised through a new liquidity contract that prices the share using a calculation
###### formula. 

   - Corporate social contribution (forfait social): 20% of the free share plan.


-----

###### Since a liquidity contract has been set up, the shares awarded to beneficiaries will be settled in cash. The free share plan therefore meets the definition of a “cash-settled” plan set out in IFRS 2. Consequently, the service cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the rights, with a direct offsetting entry to employee-related liabilities. 
 This service cost is reviewed each year in light of budget assumptions and employee turnover. At 31 December 2019, the free share plan only concerned one employee and 100,000 free shares, representing a maximum aggregate amount of €200,000. The other beneficiaries of the plan had left the company. The impact of the revised service cost was recognised in the statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding adjustment to employee-related liabilities. The net service cost for 2019 represents €20,000 on account of the provision accrued in 2018. This cost was included within capitalised production with an adjusting entry to employee-related payables. It will be amortised as from the date the “Millénium” project (development of new management software for the property management network) enters into service. 
 There are no stock option or free share plans in place at Foncia Management.

 Pensions and other post-employment benefits

  Short-term benefits 
 Short-term benefits include paid annual leave, paid sick leave, bonuses and other benefits (other than contract termination benefits), expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period during which the employee services are rendered. Short-term benefits are expensed in the period in which the corresponding services are rendered by the employee. Any amounts not paid at the end of the reporting period are carried in current liabilities.

  Post-employment benefits
 In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which the Group operates, Foncia participates in, or operates, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. 

 Virtually all of the Group’s employees are entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by the Foncia Group to the beneficiaries when the rights allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds financed in compliance with the applicable government requirements and regulations. These plans may be funded by investments in various instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds.
 Post-employment benefits are measured and recognised by the Group in accordance with IAS 19 – Employee Benefits, as described below.

   - Defined contribution plans

###### Defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans are expensed as incurred in the statement of profit and loss based on contributions.

   - Defined benefit plans

###### The cost of defined benefit plans is measured on an actuarial basis. The related obligations are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on the agreements in effect in each company.
 Obligations are determined by reference to assumptions that are revised each year and relate for example to length of service, life expectancy, salary inflation and employee turnover, and also take into account macroeconomic assumptions for the various countries in which the Group does business (e.g., discount rate and inflation rate).
 The assumptions used for 2019 are detailed in Note 4.13. 


-----

###### A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position for the difference between the related projected benefit obligation (actuarial liability) and any plan assets as measured at fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses.
 If plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation recognised, a non-current asset is recorded for the amount of the plans in the consolidated statement of financial position. A funding surplus (net defined benefit asset) is only recognised in the statement of financial position if its represents future economic benefits that will actually be available to the Group. When the calculation of the net benefit obligation gives rise to an asset for the Group, the amount recognised as an asset cannot exceed the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or future reductions in contributions to the plan. 
 Expenses under defined benefit plans comprise three components, accounted for as described below:

 - Service cost is recognised under personnel costs within operating profit. It includes service cost for the period, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments, which are recognised in full in profit or loss for the period in which they arose, and gains and losses arising on plan settlements.

 - Interest cost is recognised in other financial income and expenses and reflects the impact of discounting the obligations, net of the expected return on plan assets as measured using the discount rate applied to calculate those obligations.

 - Remeasurements of the net liability (or net asset) are included in other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss, and do not impact the statement of profit and loss. They essentially comprise actuarial gains and losses, i.e., changes in the benefit obligation and in plan assets attributable to changes in assumptions and experience adjustments. Experience adjustments represent the difference between the expected impact of certain actuarial assumptions applied to previous measurements of the obligation and actual experience.

  Other long-term benefits
 Other long-term benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19. The estimated cost of these benefits is recognised within non-current liabilities over the employees’ qualifying years of service. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs attributable to amendments to an existing plan or the introduction of a new plan are taken immediately to profit or loss.
 In France, the collective bargaining agreement for the real estate industry stipulates that all active employees who so request are entitled to one month’s salary at every anniversary date: after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of professional experience. Professional experience is considered overall and not as experience solely within the Group. However, the Group is only liable for the amount proportionate to the employee’s seniority in the Group.
 The Group’s obligation under long-service awards is assessed each year by an independent expert. 
 The assumptions used for 2019 are detailed in Note 4.13. 

 3.4.15. Deferred taxes
 Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes, using the tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the asset is realised and the liability settled, on the basis of tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 Deferred tax does not arise on: 

   - the initial recognition of goodwill;

   - the initial recognition of an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the
###### accounting profit (loss) nor taxable profit (loss); 


-----

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, to the extent that it is probable they will not
###### reverse in the foreseeable future. 

 Tax on items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income, respectively, and not in the statement of profit and loss. 
 Deferred tax assets arising on temporary differences (after offsetting against deferred tax liabilities) or on tax losses and tax credits carried forward are only recognised to the extent that it is probable they will reverse and that the Group will generate future taxable earnings against which they can be utilised.
 The following are taken into account when assessing the Group’s ability to recover these assets: 

   - forecasts of future taxable earnings;

   - taxable earnings in previous years.

###### Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.

 3.4.16. Trade payables and other current liabilities
 Trade payables and other current liabilities are liabilities to be settled or renegotiated within the ordinary operating cycle or within 12 months following the end of the reporting period. Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (see Note 3.4.10). 
 These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. The value of items that will be paid over the long term is discounted.

 3.4.17. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value
 The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the end of the reporting period, either for accounting purposes or for disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. 
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 IFRS 13 sets out a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value:

   - Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

   - Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
###### liability, either directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., price-based inputs).

   - Level 3: inputs relating to the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable
###### inputs).

 The Group primarily uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, cash management financial assets and identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination. 
 The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 4.19. 


-----

###### 3.4.18. Assets classified as held for sale, businesses sold or in the process of sale and discontinued
 operations
 IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations sets forth the accounting requirements applicable to assets held for sale, along with the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.
 IFRS 5 requires assets held for sale to be presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial position for the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell, provided that they meet the definition of assets held for sale set out in the standard. 
 When the Group is engaged in a sale process resulting in the loss of control of a subsidiary, the entire assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, regardless of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the subsidiary after the sale. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable.
 The assets and liabilities concerned are reclassified in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, and no offsetting is permitted.
 Businesses sold or in the process of sale are presented on a separate line in the statement of profit and loss for the periods presented, which shows post-tax profit or loss attributable to discontinued operations and the post-tax gain or loss on the disposal or the measurement to fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups comprising the business sold or in the process of sale.
 A business sold or in the process of sale discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major line of business and meets the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale or has been sold by the Group.
 Similarly, cash flows attributable to businesses sold or in the process of sale are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods presented.
 Under IFRS 5, profits or losses related to discontinued operations are also to be shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of profit and loss, retrospectively for all periods presented. A discontinued operation can be defined as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and:

  represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; 

  is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or

  is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

 3.4.19. Presentation of the statement of profit and loss
 As permitted under IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements, the Group has chosen to present operating expenses by nature.
 “Recurring operating profit (loss)”, “Operating profit (loss)”, “Cost of gross debt” and “Cost of net debt” in the statement of profit and loss and gains and losses recognised directly in equity are presented in accordance with the criteria set out in ANC Recommendation No. 2013-03 issued by the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables).


-----

###### 3.4.20. Revenue
 Revenue for the Group results from sales of services within the scope of the ordinary operations of consolidated subsidiaries, less revenue from intragroup transactions. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. 
 In accordance with IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, and specific criteria are met by each of the Group’s businesses.

  Jointly owned property management business

 From a contractual and legal perspective, the Group’s jointly owned property management business is mostly conducted through mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services such as:
  preparing, convening and organising General Meetings; 

  managing the joint owners’ council;

  managing the financial operations and keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association; 

  managing the jointly owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations; 

  carrying out periodic visits and inspections of the jointly owned property.

 All such services are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association. Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis (over time) based on actual amounts billed (costs are in line with the billed amounts). 

 Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and disputes. Since each additional service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognised when the service is performed. 

  Rental management business 

 In its rental management business, the Group acts as agent for owners-lessors and fulfils a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These mainly concern: 

  routine management services, for example, rent reviews and collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, sending of rent receipts to lessees, and deposits;

  other one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of documentation, management of claims, administrative filings, and requests for subsidies;

  technical management services, such as on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys, and preparation of essential information documents for lessees;

  insurance against unpaid rent; 

  other insurance such as for vacant premises or property damage.

 These represent separate service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognised separately. Revenue from services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance (falling outside the scope of IFRS 4) is recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue from one-off services is recognised when those services are provided. 


-----

######  Lettings 

 Revenue is recognised at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted. The Group collects fees from owners and from lessees. 

  Transactions business/Efficity

 Revenue on the transactions business is recognised upon signature of the notarised final sale agreement (acte authentique), which is the date on which control is presumed to have been transferred. 

  Client accounts

 Interest income generated on client funds is booked in revenue.

  Assurimo

 Assurismo provides property insurance brokerage services. Revenue under comprehensive property insurance and comprehensive homeowners’ insurance policies is recognised over the term of the cover, since services in this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis. 

  Constatimmo

 Constatimmo carries out mandatory technical surveys on premises, as well as inventories of premises for lessees. Its revenue is recognised and measured when the related services are performed. 

  Seiitra

 Seiitra provides specialist IT property services and developed the Thetrawin software, which it markets through the sale of software licenses. These property management tools offer the full suite of functionalities needed to keep accounting records for client accounts and to manage suspense accounts, jointly owned properties and rentals, as well as the budget of jointly owned property associations. Maintenance fees are recognised on a straight-line, percentage-of-completion basis, since the corresponding services are provided over time. 

  Esset Management

 Esset Management provides property management services (jointly owned property management and rental services) for institutions. The accounting principles applied are the same as those explained above for the private property management business. 

  Foncia Valorisation

 Foncia Valorisation provides investment strategy consulting and arbitrage (appraisals, lending, block/unit property sales) for institutional clients or wealthy families. Its revenue is recognised at the date the notarised final sale agreement is signed and is based on a percentage of the sale price. 

  Leeemo

 Leemo, a wholly-owned Group subsidiary since 2017, is a listing service for properties for sale. It has developed a digital platform for property companies where it lists new real estate projects by different developers as well as certain older properties that are to be made available for sale to private and institutional investors. 

 It derives its revenue from two main sources: 
  fees on sale agreements: amounts billed to developers and partially retroceded to business providers. Only the net margin is recognised in revenue.
  fees on bundles of services sold to developers without any retrocession requirements. 


-----

###### Revenue from fees on sale agreements is recognised when the notarised final sale agreement is signed. Revenue from fees earned on bundles of services is recognised on a pro rata basis in the period. 

 3.4.21. Recurring operating profit (loss)
 Recurring operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, with the exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses)”.
 Recurring operating profit (loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes all items included in operating profit (loss), restated for any non-recurring items.  Costs relating to business combinations or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit (loss).

 3.4.22. Non-recurring operating income (expenses)
 This caption includes income and expense items that, owing to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as arising in the ordinary course of the Group’s operations and are therefore not reported in recurring operating profit (loss). Non-recurring items are limited, unusual and/or irregular items of a material amount. 
 They include impacts of changes in the scope of consolidation, goodwill impairment, and amortisation and impairment charged against trademarks and software. If material, non-recurring items also include the effects of certain unusual transactions such as capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring fees, fees relating to major claims and disputes, and any other income or expenses likely to affect the comparability of recurring operating profit (loss) from one period to the next.
 It should be noted that for transactions directly related to external growth and projects to transform or restructure the business (particularly mergers and reorganisations), a detailed procedure is in place to identify, classify and validate any transactions of a non-recurring nature. This procedure gives a precise indication of transactions that meet the criteria to be recorded in this category. 

 3.4.23. Operating profit (loss)
 Operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, irrespective of whether they are of a recurring nature or whether they result from one-off decisions or transactions.

 3.4.24. Cost of net debt
 The cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings, less financial income from cash investments.

 3.4.25. Income tax
 Income tax expense for the year includes current and deferred income tax expense, which are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income. 
 The Group calculates its current taxes in accordance with the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which its earnings are taxable. Current tax expense is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable profit. However, management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax authorities.
 Income tax expense includes the amounts reported by French subsidiaries in respect of the CVAE tax assessed on value added, since the Group considers this tax meets the definition of income tax set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes. 


-----

###### When they have not been set against income tax, income tax credits that are not included in the calculation of taxable profit and that are always refunded by the State are recorded as subsidies and reduce the expenses to which they relate.

 3.4.26. Earnings (loss) per share
 Earnings (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) attributable to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period (excluding treasury shares).
 Operating segments The Group is not concerned by IFRS 8 – Operating Segments. Revenue is broken down by business in Note 5.1. 

 3.4.27. Statement of cash flows
 Consolidated cash and cash equivalents, changes in which are displayed in the statement of cash flows, are defined as the net balance of cash and cash equivalents, current bank overdraft facilities and bank credit balances repayable on demand that form an integral part of the cash management strategy.
 Changes in cash from operating activities are calculated based on operating profit (loss) adjusted for transactions with no cash impact.

###### It should be recalled that on 7 September 2016, Foncia Management acquired a controlling interest in the Foncia Holding group for an enterprise value of €1,832.9 million and a purchase price of €807.5 million, in light of existing bank debt at the date control was acquired. The final goodwill allocation was completed in 2018. Goodwill was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used within the scope of the purchase price accounting. 
 The portion of goodwill allocated to the businesses sold (Foncia Pierre Gestion and Foncia Plus) or in the process of sale (Foncia Primaliance) was measured based on the businesses’ contribution to 2016 EBITDA for the Services division, taking into account an initial allocation of €267.8 million for the Services CGU. 
 Goodwill relating to Foncia Primaliance was written down in an amount of €16.5 million over the period following the remeasurement of net assets held for sale at fair value. This operation is described in the “Highlights of the year” section in Note 2.2.2. 
 The final allocation of the Lodgis purchase price led to the recognition on the statement of financial position of a trademark of €2.3 million, software of €1.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of €1 million, recorded against an adjustment to goodwill in an amount of €2.9 million.

###### 4.1.2. 2019 impairment tests
 The assumptions used in the tests and the approach applied are described below. 
 Impacts of IFRS 16 on the impairment testing approach 
 IFRS 16 introduces significant changes to the inputs used in impairment tests, including the net amount tested, debt and valuation multiples. It therefore requires entities to reconsider their testing approach. In this regard, several different approaches have been proposed by the regulators to assist entities in their transition to IFRS 16. 
 The first, which complies with IAS 36, involves increasing the carrying amount of the CGU by the amount of the right-of-use asset, without taking into account the IFRS 16 lease liability. This approach represents a change of practice and introduces a degree of complexity into the calculation of value in use, since (i) cash flows relating solely to fixed lease payments or similar are excluded from the calculation insofar as they constitute the new lease liability, (ii) the cash outflows required to renew the right-of-use assets are to be estimated (future reinvestment flows affecting both the series of annual projections and the terminal value), and (iii) the discount rate is to be adjusted (estimated impact on the WACC of the new cost of capital/cost of debt ratio).
 The second approach is similar to the one described above and involves eliminating the lease liability from the carrying amount of the CGU and from the value in use. This approach leads to similar difficulties as those seen above. 
 The third solution is to maintain the pre-IFRS 16 approach in terms of projecting future cash flows. Although the carrying amount of the CGU changes (increase in the value of the right-of-use asset net of the lease liability), the calculation of value in use is not affected: 

 - projected cash outflows relating to lease payments remain unchanged for both the annual forecasts and for the terminal value; 

 - the discount rate is determined by reference to pre-IFRS 16 inputs (no change in the cost of debt and the debt-to-equity ratio).

 As the practical complexity of the first two approaches could undermine the reliability of the calculations (insufficient hindsight regarding the adjustment of certain cash flow inputs), the Group chose to use the third approach for its impairment tests in 2019. 
 Calculation of the carrying amount of CGUs at 31 December 2019 
 Estimating the carrying amount of each CGU includes determining the value of the assets that may be directly attributed or reasonably allocated to the CGU and that will generate cash flows included in the calculation of value in use. 
 Goodwill of €1,094.9 million arising on the acquisition of a controlling interest in Foncia Holding in September 2016 (see Note 4.1.1 above) was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used within the scope of the purchase price accounting. The goodwill allocation resulted in the following: 

|Property Holding International Goodwill - €m Management Services CGU companies CGU France CGU Goodw ill (Foncia Management PPA) 1,094.9 784.2 42.9 267.8 Allocation resulting from DCF/CGU at 30 Sept. 2016 71.6% 3.9% 24.5%|Consolidated 1,094.9 100.0%|
|---|---|
|Total goodwill 784 43 268|1,095|

###### For intangible assets identified during the purchase price accounting for Foncia Holding and subsequent material acquisitions, the allocation at 31 December 2019 is as follows (based on the carrying amount): 

 • Property Management France CGU: €354.7 million to the Foncia trademark and €333.7 million to client relationships; 
 • Property Management International CGU: €21.6 million to the Brolliet, Domicim and Trévi trademarks and €7.5 million to client relationships; 
 • Services CGU: €41.6 million to the Foncia trademark and €42.9 million to client relationships. 
 The holding company’s residual economic assets following the asset allocation shown above were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU to reflect the cost allocation of the holding company used to draw up the business plans.
 Calculation of the recoverable amount of CGUs at 31 December 2019
 In accordance with the Group’s impairment testing approach (see Note 3.4.7), and in the absence of observable fair values in an organised market, the recoverable amount of CGUs corresponds to their value in use, which is defined as the sum of their net cash flows based on the latest forecasts for each CGU, determined using:

  a business plan prepared by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performance, forecast changes in the economic environment, and expected market trends;

  a terminal value calculated by capitalising normative cash flows obtained by extrapolating cash flows from the final year of the business plan, with a stable growth rate or a growth rate increasing steadily over the long term;

  expected cash flows discounted at a rate determined by reference to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
 The financial forecasts used in the impairment tests carried out at 31 December 2019 were prepared by management and cover a period of six years. They provide a consolidated view as well as a breakdown by CGU.

 It should be noted that all holding company expenses not allocated in the consolidated business plan were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU. Corporate functions are managed at individual country-level for the Property Management International CGU and are considered not material for the Services CGU. 

 The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated based on a sample of comparable European companies. A WACC was estimated for each foreign country, with the impacts of IFRS 16 eliminated
##### among the sample companies in order to obtain a pre-IFRS 16 segment financial structure. A WACC was then
###### calculated for the entire Foncia Group based on a weighting of each country’s contribution to total EBITDA. On this basis, a single weighted discount rate of 7.4% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs. 

**Group WACC**

**Country** **WACC** **2019 EBITDA (%)** **WACC contribution**

France (Property Management + Services) 7.4% 94.9% 7.0%
Belgium 7.6% 1.3% 0.1%
Germany 7.1% 1.3% 0.1%
Sw itzerland 7.8% 2.5% 0.2%

**Group WACC** **7.4%**

###### The activities of the Services CGU are closely linked to the activities of the Property Management France CGU and the Group therefore considers that these two CGUs are exposed to a comparable level of risk. 
 A long-term growth rate of 1.8% was used for the tests. This rate was estimated using information provided by public databases such as the IMF and EIU (Economic Intelligence Unit).


-----

##### Results of impairment tests

###### The strategic plan used for the tests forecasts a rise in cash flow from operations and hence a significant increase in the terminal value included within value in use. 
 The table below presents the values in use obtained for the three CGUs, compared with the carrying amounts of their respective economic assets. 

|Summary of work performed|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|WACC PGR Carrying € millions Value in use Difference Margin (%) Assumptions Assumptions amount|||
||Assumptions|Assumptions|
|Property Management CGU 2,000 1,587 413 26.0% International CGU 227 61 166 271.3% Services CGU 738 398 339 85.2%|7.42% 7.57% 7.42%|1.8% 1.8% 1.8%|
|Group CGU 2,965 2,046 919 44.9%|7.43%|1.8%|


###### As the value in use of each CGU exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment needed to be recognised against the Group’s assets at 31 December 2019. 
 Sensitivity analyses:
 As recommended by IFRS, the results of these impairment tests were verified by determining sensitivity to changes in certain inputs:

  +/- 1% change in the long-term growth rate used in the business plan;
  +/- 1% change in the discount rate (WACC); 
  normative EBITDA growth rate. 
  normative capital expenditure/depreciation and amortisation. 
 The sensitivity analyses show no specific risk of impairment for the CGUs.

###### Trademarks 

 At the date on which Foncia Management acquired a controlling interest in Foncia Holding (September 2016), the Foncia Group and Domicim trademarks were recognised at an amount of €414.2 million based on their valuations. The Group also estimated the value of the Brolliet trademark at CHF €13.7 million (i.e., €12.5 million at 31 December 2019). 

 Changes in the scope of consolidation reflect the derecognition of the Foncia Pierre Gestion trademark, which had been valued at €6 million during the purchase price accounting for Foncia Management. 
 Concessions, patents and software 

 Concessions, patents and software include the systems measured in connection with the purchase price accounting for Foncia Management at €10.4 million, as well as the management software used by Lodgis representing €1.7 million. The Syndic+ software had been written down in full at end-June 2019 in an amount of €4.3 million (impairment recognised within non-recurring expenses). 

 Investments in the period amounting to €2 million mainly concern the Swiss entities for €1.2 million (DBS Immobilier and Gribi). 

 Other changes amounting to €32.7 million chiefly concern (i) the capitalisation of intangible assets in progress, including €17.6 million for the Seiitra network in respect of upgraded Thetrawin (Powimo project) and regulatory (Thetrawin Legacy) modules, and (ii) Foncia Groupe for €5.6 million in respect of miscellaneous ongoing IT projects.
 Business goodwill/client relationships 

 At the time of Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting, the fair value of the Foncia Group’s client relationships was estimated at €460.8 million, breaking down between the Group’s three CGUs as follows: (i) Property Management France (excluding the transactions business): €396.2 million, (ii) Property Management International (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium): €2.2 million, and (iii) Services: €62.5 million.

 Following the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Brolliet group in September 2016, client relationships were valued at CHF 7.5 million (€6.9 million at 31 December 2019).

 Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €5.8 million reflect the derecognition of Foncia Pierre Gestion client relationships. Similarly, the Foncia Primaliance client relationship was reclassified within assets held for sale in an amount of €3 million. 

 Investments totalling €1.3 million primarily relate to acquisitions of business goodwill within the scope of external growth transactions carried out in the period.

###### Other intangible assets 

 Other intangible assets essentially comprise the cost of acquiring new business. The €5 million increase in this item during the period reflects the capitalisation of the costs of acquiring new mandates, rebilled to other firms in the network. Decreases totalling €1.5 million relate to the retirement of these costs for lots that were not secured in the period.

 Machinery and equipment 

 Investments in machinery and equipment amounting to €7.4 million notably relate to the replacement of IT equipment (screens, phones, etc.) at Foncia Groupe for €3.7 million. 

 Other changes representing €5.7 million primarily concern the reclassification of (i) new hosting facilities for €2 million, reported within intangible assets in progress at 31 December 2018, and (ii) capitalised costs relating to IT equipment for €2.8 million. 

 Changes in the scope of consolidation chiefly concern IT equipment resulting from businesses acquired (Gribi for €0.4 million and Sigla for €0.2 million).

 Other changes relate to the commissioning of fittings work.
 Finance leases 

 Assets held under finance leases in accordance with IAS 17, previously shown within property, plant and equipment, are now included within right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16. This is because they are considered to be costs that were incurred in order to obtain the lease and are therefore inseparable from that lease.

###### Most leases relate to Group business premises. These contracts are managed using a dynamic approach directly in line with the operating performance of the Group’s branch network and its real estate strategy. In France, around 808 property leases were included in this caption, of which more than 44% are automatically renewable. At 1 January 2019, the most important such leases relate to the head office at Antony, Esset Management’s premises at Aubervilliers, and the Boulevard Haussmann and Boulevard de Courcelles premises in Paris. Changes in the period can be explained as follows: 
  Changes in the scope of consolidation concern property leases taken on from the various companies acquired
 in the period, notably Sigla (€3.8 million), Bourgeois Immobilier (€1.9 million) and OTIM (€1.3 million). 
  Reductions in the lease term mainly relate to the derecognition of Esset Management’s Aubervilliers lease
 for €8.7 million (the company moved its premises to Courbevoie at the end of the year) and to the early derecognition of the Foncia Paris Rive Droite lease at 6-8 boulevard Haussmann in Paris for €4 million. 
  New leases for €32.9 million concern a total of 53 new contracts. However, the six main leases account for
 almost 64% of right-of-use assets. These include the lease of the Rue Raymond Losserand premises in Paris for €7.5 million and the lease of Esset Management’s new premises in Courbevoie for €6.7 million. 

 For the vehicle fleet in France, the first-time application of IFRS 16 resulted in the reclassification of CIC lease contracts measured at €2.6 million under IAS 17 and the measurement of 188 Arval contracts for €1.7 million at 1 January 2019. New leases concern 860 new vehicles delivered by Arval in 2019, which had a €5 million impact on lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Reductions in the lease term relate to the derecognition of 570 CIC vehicle leases, with only two vehicles under CIC leases still on the road at 31 December 2019.

###### Receivables owed by the State chiefly concern CICE tax receivables for €25.3 million and VAT receivables in France for €45.8 million.
 Shareholder accounts receivable at 31 December 2019 relate mainly to financing granted by the Group to companies in the process of being acquired and therefore not consolidated. 
 As from the date of first-time application of IFRS 16, prepaid expenses recorded in respect of leases have been eliminated in the statement of financial position since they are included as part of the carrying amount of right-of-use assets. At 31 December 2019, residual prepaid expenses mainly concern insurance costs (primarily the third party and professional liability premium), IT repair and maintenance costs and management fees paid to guarantee funds.

###### Deferred tax liabilities mainly arise from the recognition of intangible assets within the scope of the purchase price accounting for Foncia Management in September 2016. Changes in the year primarily reflect the 28.92% income tax rate used to determine deferred taxes under the liability method (compared to a rate of 25.83% previously). 

 Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €2.9 million reflect the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities on the Foncia Pierre Gestion trademark and client relationships. 

 Other non-monetary changes representing a negative amount of €3.3 million concern: 

 (i) deferred tax liabilities recognised by Lodgis for €1 million following the finalisation of the purchase price accounting process and the recognition of a trademark and software for a total of €4 million; 

 (ii) the reclassification of tax representing a negative amount of €1.6 million, recorded against deferred taxes on other adjustments. 

 Changes in deferred taxes on other adjustments attributable to changes in the scope of consolidation for €6.9 million reflect the cancellation of existing business goodwill in the individual statement of financial position of companies consolidated for the first time during the period. 

 Deferred taxes on temporary differences mainly arise on acquisition-related fees, provisions for employee profit-sharing and paid leave, and the tax treatment of translation adjustments.

The Foncia Group holds the remaining 95% of Teck-way, with a capital contribution of €1.9 million at 31 December 2019.

###### As described in the “Highlights of the year” section, the Group carried out various transactions in the year involving its syndicated credit facility: 

  On 3 May 2019, it arranged a new senior facility B tranche for €178 million, intended to refinance the full amount drawn under the revolving credit facility, the authorised overdraft as well as the debt restructuring fees.
  On 31 July 2019, it arranged an additional new senior facility B tranche for €110 million in order to refinance the full amount of the second-lien loan. 

 The applicable terms and conditions for these new tranches are closely aligned with those of the term loan B. The characteristics of the Group’s main financing facilities are set out below in Note 4.12.3. 

 The fees for these two operations represented €3.1 million and €0.8 million, respectively, and will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method. 
  The Group also extended the amount available for drawdown under its revolving credit facility by €70 million, bringing the total amount of the facility (including the authorised overdraft) to €220 million. The fees for this operation represented €650,000. At 31 December 2019, the revolving credit facility had been repaid in full. 
 It should also be noted that the 2015 CICE prefinancing credit was refunded in 2019 in an amount of €7.8 million.
 Following the Group’s 22 May 2019 acquisition of the 55% stake in the Initiative et Partenaire sub-group that it did not already own, the €3.2 million liability representing the minority put was reversed against consolidated equity. Similarly, the earn-out on FIPM shares was cleared in February 2019 for €3 million. 
 Update on the financial liabilities recognised in respect of the preferred shares issued within the scope of the Leemo/Primonial transaction
 By way of reminder, at 31 December 2018 these preferred shares were classified within financial liabilities by default and included within net debt for €7 million, since the basis on which the shares issued within the scope of the aforementioned transaction could be converted did not represent a fixed basis. 

 At the end of each reporting period, the Group is required to assess the convertibility of these preferred shares in 2021, which depends on changes in the respective contributions of the Foncia Group and Primonial to Leemo’s net revenue. An analysis of each group’s contribution could allow either (i) Primonial to increase its interest in Leemo to a maximum of 48,457 shares (49% of the share capital), or (ii) the Foncia Group to collect up to €2 million in cash compensation. 

 Based on 2019 revenue, the situation favours the Foncia Group. However, a conservative approach was adopted when preparing the 2019 financial statements and no receivable was recognised.

###### The actuarial estimate of provisions for retirement benefits and long-service awards was based on the report drawn up by Mercer, the firm mandated to estimate post-employment benefit obligations for the entire Group. A provision is set aside for all outstanding obligations, estimated based on rights accrued and salary projections, taking into account mortality rates, employee turnover and a discount assumption. 
 For France, the increase in provisions for retirement benefits is mainly attributable to the service cost totalling €1.3 million, reflecting the increase in the net obligation resulting from the contributions of Foncia personnel in 2019. 
 Net actuarial gains of €0.5 million reflect:

 (i) an increase of €0.8 million in the obligation attributable to new beneficiaries resulting from companies acquired in 2018; 

 (ii) a decrease of €0.3 million related to the revised turnover table based on actual employee turnover rates in
 the 2013-2018 period. It should be specified that in accordance with IAS 19, this table only reflects natural attrition and therefore excludes lay-offs and terminations by mutual agreement (rupture conventionnelle). 

 These actuarial gains are recognised in consolidated equity net of tax.

 The increase in long-service awards essentially results from actuarial gains of €1 million. These actuarial gains are attributable to various factors, including: 

 (i) €0.7 million related to experience adjustments (owing mainly to new beneficiaries resulting from companies acquired in 2018); 

 (ii) €0.4 million related to the revised turnover table, which takes into account forced departures.

 The take-up rate for long-service awards has been set at 100%, as in 2018.

 Obligations in respect of long-service awards are included within other long-term benefits in accordance with IAS 19. In this respect, any actuarial gains and losses are to be taken to profit or loss in the period. Since these actuarial gains and losses result from exceptional events, they were included in non-recurring operating items.

###### In Switzerland, the increase in provisions over the period chiefly reflects the measurement of net benefit obligations relating to the acquired companies Gribi and Guinnard, representing €2.8 million and €0.1 million, respectively (127 employees at Gribi and 7 at Guinnard), along with €2.8 million in net actuarial losses resulting from: 

 (i) an increase of €5.9 million in benefit obligations owing to the change in the discount rate from 0.90% to
 0.20%; 

 (ii) a decrease of €4.8 million in benefit obligations owing to a better-than-expected return on plan assets; 

 (iii) an experience loss of €1.8 million.
 Calculation assumptions used 
 Actuarial calculations are based on a number of long-term assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis.

###### Changes in provisions for risks on client accounts 
 Based on a detailed analysis of Esset Management client accounts, the Group adjusted the provisions it had accrued at the time of the 2016 acquisition, resulting in a reversal of €3.4 million, of which €2.9 million was recognised in non-recurring operating items.

###### Changes in provisions for other disputes 
 The significant decrease in provisions for other disputes follows the reversal of provisions for Orpi and franchisee disputes, with an impact of €1.6 million and €0.8 million, respectively, on non-recurring operating items. 

  Update on the dispute with franchisees

 As a reminder, in 2014-2015 former franchisees had brought proceedings against the Foncia Group after receiving notice that their contracts would not be renewed. They accused the Group of wrongful termination and various breaches of the franchise agreements. Of the 21 initial lawsuits representing an aggregate €19.3 million, disputes with only seven franchisees were still ongoing at the reporting date, representing €4.5 million. At 31 December 2019, the provision set aside in respect of these disputes was reduced to €0.5 million. In January 2020, an initial decision was handed down in favour of Foncia Franchise, in which the court dismissed all of the franchisee’s claims (including those that had been successful in first instance). The six other disputes will be heard by the same court between end-May and end-June 2020. 

  Update on the ORPI dispute 

 A preliminary agreement was negotiated with ORPI providing for the payment of €0.5 million in compensation to settle the dispute between four Foncia entities and ORPI. The related provision was written back in full at 31 December 2019. 
 Changes in provisions for employee disputes 

 Provisions for employee disputes concerned 98 lawsuits compared to 108 lawsuits at 31 December 2018. Out of the 98 lawsuits, 27 are in progress and relate to amounts in excess of €100,000. In all, the claims represent approximately €13.3 million. The resolution of employee disputes in the period resulted in expenses of €0.8 million and a write-back of €1.6 million from the provision. 
 Changes in provisions for URSSAF social security audits 

 This caption includes provisions for URSSAF audits that had been measured in the opening statement of financial position after a risk was identified on benefits in kind for €0.9 million. Since a portion of the reassessment risk has exceeded the statute of limitations, the Group partially wrote back this provision, with the resulting €0.5 million reversal recorded in non-recurring operating items.

###### Other miscellaneous payables include outstanding balances payable on acquisitions of securities. At 31 December 2019, liabilities in respect of outstanding purchase price balances concerned 38 acquisitions, including Gedim (€0.7 million), BIG (€0.4 million), Bellavita and ABL (€0.6 million) and Ouest Immo (€0.3 million).

 Deferred revenue chiefly concerns Assurimo for €15.8 million. 

 The “Group and equity-accounted companies” line includes miscellaneous amounts payable under shareholder accounts to sellers of companies not yet consolidated. At 31 December 2019, the main item in this line concerned ABL for €0.4 million. Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €10.8 million reflect shareholder account financing of newly consolidated companies that were refinanced by the Group following their acquisition.

###### Client accounts and “Article 55” transaction (Hoguet law) accounts
 Accounting for client accounts is a separate and autonomous form of accounting. At 31 December 2019, the balance of client accounts and “Article 55” transaction accounts therefore represents all of the transactions carried out for each client account. This balance totalled €530.9 million, reported under assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2019. 
 France’s ALUR law requires the use of separate accounts for jointly owned properties comprising more than 15 main lots as from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, Foncia decided not to present separate accounts for its joint ownership association management activities in its statement of financial position. The ordinance dated 31 October 2019 now requires separate accounts to be established for all jointly owned properties by 31 December 2020 at the latest. As a result, funds held in respect of jointly owned properties are expected to decrease sharply in 2020. 
 The statement of financial position does not include any amount for Germany or Belgium, which only use separate accounts.

###### In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, which set out the rules for measuring and recognising financial instruments, instruments with a positive fair value are recognised in assets and those with a negative fair value are recognised in liabilities. Fair values of financial instruments are provided by the financial institutions with which the transactions are carried out.

 4.18.1. Interest rate derivatives 
 Further to its refinancing on 7 September 2016, the Group entered into an interest rate cap agreement on 7 December 2016 under the terms and conditions set out below: 

 • Notional amount: €527.9 million 
 • Floating rate hedged: 3-month Euribor 
 • Hedged rate: maximum rate of 1% 
 • Hedging period: 7 December 2016 to 6 December 2019. This hedge was no longer in force at 31 December 2019. 
 On 19 October 2017, the Group also entered into an additional deferred interest rate cap agreement under the following terms and conditions: 

 • Notional amount: €400 million 
 • Floating rate hedged: 3-month Euribor 
 • Hedged rate: maximum rate of 1.5% 
 • Hedging period: 7 December 2019 to 6 December 2020 
 The historic premiums paid in respect of these two cap agreements totalled €915,000.
 On 24 May 2019, the Group entered into an additional interest rate cap agreement under the following terms and conditions:

 • Notional amount: €70 million (7 June 2019 to 9 September 2019), then €200 million (9 September 2019 to 7 September 2020)
 • Floating rate hedged: 3-month Euribor 
 • Hedged rate: maximum rate of 1.25% 
 • Hedging period: 7 June 2019 to 7 September 2020  
 The premium paid in respect of this cap agreement in 2019 totalled €5,000.
 Given the prevailing negative interbank interest rate environment, these derivative instruments have a fair value of zero in the 2019 financial statements.

(1) Comparative information has been restated to reflect the change in accounting presentation for Leemo revenue (see Note 2.7). Due to this change in

accounting presentation, the Group now shows billed amounts net of the costs of fee retrocessions in order to present only those fees attributable to the
Group. Statement of profit and loss figures for 2018 have been restated, leading to a negative impact of €14.9 million on revenue as presented.

###### In 2019, the property management business in France represents almost 60% of the Group’s total revenue. Revenue from this business chiefly comprises rental management fees (including rent payment and occupancy guarantees), jointly owned property management fees and letting fees. 

 In all, 88% of the Group’s business is generated in France. 
 The significant growth in revenue between 2018 and 2019 reflects: 

 (i) the impact of acquisitions carried out in 2019 for an amount of €73.2 million; 

 (ii) an increase of some €2.3 million in organic growth; 

 (iii) a positive currency effect of €2.5 million related solely to Switzerland, with the average EUR/CHF exchange rate
 decreasing from 1.16 in 2018 to 1.11 in 2019.

###### Issuance fees for the syndicated loan, totalling €34.6 million at 31 December 2019, are recognised over the term of the loan by adjusting the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability to the financial liability’s carrying amount. 
 Additional drawdowns on senior facility B in May (€178 million) and July 2019 (€110 million) explain the €5.4 million increase in interest on this facility (see Note 2.3 “Highlights of the year”). Similarly, the €8 million decrease in interest expenses on the ICA second-lien loan is attributable to the repayment of €77 million on this facility in August 2018, followed by the remaining €110 million in July 2019.
 In 2018, the early reclassification of expenses still to be amortised concerned the ICA loan further to the partial repayment amounting to €77 million.

###### Foreign exchange gains recognised in 2018 resulted from fluctuations in CHF up to 29 June 2018, the date on which the net investment hedge was recognised in respect of the loan granted to Foncia Switzerland by Foncia Groupe. As from this date, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the loan have been taken to other comprehensive income (equity) under foreign currency translation reserves and therefore no longer impact profit or loss. 
 Net income of €1.1 million on unwinding the discount reflects the time value of housing loans and is attributable to the decrease in the discount rate used, from 1.57% in 2018 to 0.7% in 2019. 
 In 2018, “Other” mainly concerned fees due on the early repayment of the second-lien ICA loan for €1.5 million.

###### It should be recalled that following the acquisition of Foncia Holding by Foncia Management on 7 September 2016, a new tax group was formed, effective as of 1 January 2017. The new group opted for a tax loss carry-forward system along the lines of the former tax consolidation group, but with a broader scope. 
 The tax group reported consolidated tax income of €2 million for 2019, notably reflecting the add-back of €13.9 million in non-deductible financial expenses (tax base) and the utilisation of €7.3 million in tax losses carried forward by the tax consolidation group (tax base).

###### Current income tax expense excluding the tax consolidation group essentially concerns Foncia Pierre Gestion for €1.2 million and Foncia Brette for €0.5 million. Current income tax expense for foreign companies relates mainly to Switzerland for €1.1 million and Belgium for €0.9 million.
 A provision for tax contingencies was set aside by Esset Management on 18 December 2019 after the company received notification from the French tax authorities of a tax reassessment related mainly to unjustified expenses. This provision has been reclassified within current income tax expense in accordance with IAS 12. 
 Deferred tax income recognised in the year mainly relates to the decrease in the deferred tax rate in France, from 28.92% in 2018 to 25.83% in 2019. 
 Tax loss carry-forwards 
 Tax loss carry-forwards within the tax consolidation group at 31 December 2019 are as follows (after utilisation in the current period):

 • Loss arising on tax consolidation: €16.6 million. This tax loss has been recognised in full in view of the high probability that sufficient future taxable profit will exist against which it can be utilised. 

 • Proprietary tax losses of consolidated companies: €20.7 million, of which €20 million were not recognised, mainly relating to Foncia Holding (€8.9 million), IDHA (€4.8 million) and Syndic+ (€2.8 million).
 New deductibility rules for financial expenses in France 
 New rules applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 redefine the applicable framework for deductible financial expenses in France. The new rules are designed to implement Article 4 of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) into French law. Financial expenses were previously deductible at a single rate of 75% (“rabot” rule). This single rate has been replaced by a new approach introducing a cap to be calculated for each company or each tax consolidation group, as applicable. 
 Although the tax group is thinly capitalised on the basis of debt-to-equity rules, its debt-to-equity ratio is lower than that of the consolidated group. Accordingly, it deducted financial expenses at the statutory rate of 30% of its taxable EBITDA. By demonstrating its “financial independence” and therefore its eligibility for the safeguard clause, the tax consolidation group was granted an additional right to deduction representing up to 75% of net non-deducted expenses. 
 Impact of the decrease in the income tax rate on deferred tax liabilities 
 In line with the phased reduction in income tax in France through to 2022 (2020 budget), the Group cut its deferred tax rate for French entities to 25.83% from 28.92% previously. In accordance with IAS 12, adjustments related to this change in the tax rate are accounted for in a symmetrical manner and mainly included in profit or loss (when they relate to items themselves recognised in profit or loss). Taking into account a target tax rate for deferred tax bases resulted in a reduction of €15.8 million in net deferred tax liabilities and led to a corresponding increase in profit under the liability method.
 This significant decrease is attributable to a change in management’s assessment of projected cuts in this tax rate, finally agreed in 2018 after various postponements that had cast doubt on its introduction, and to the long-term timeframe for disposing of intangible assets.

###### NOTE 8. FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE

 Interest rate risk
 The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises mainly on its borrowings. These borrowings are denominated solely in euros and are managed on a centralised basis. They are mainly indexed to 3-month Euribor. The risk management policy is set by management. 

 Cash flow surpluses and working capital requirements for the Group’s companies are centralised under a cash pooling agreement and managed by the Group’s Treasury department. 

 The Group’s Treasury department selects investment vehicles for cash surpluses – either for proprietary cash or client cash (excluding separate accounts) – within the framework set by the management policy, which prioritises liquidity and security. Interest received is indexed to 3-month Euribor or is at fixed rates (term accounts).

 At 31 December 2019, interest rate risks can be broken down by management outlook as follows, taking into account interest rate maturities applied to the asset/liability financing position:

**Credit risk** **€ thousands**
Client accounts 530,860

- Term accounts (client funds) (248,888)
+ Net cash and cash equivalents 84,764
**Assets** **366,736**

 - Credit line (1,706,997)
+ Interest rate cap 470,000

- CICE (8,852)
**Liabilities** **(1,245,849)**

**Net position** **(879,113)**

###### A sudden 1% increase in short-term interest rates applied to the net position of assets and liabilities affected by interest rate fluctuations at the end of the reporting period would result in a rise of €8,791,000 in financial expenses.

 In 2019, the Group still has hedges in place for its credit facilities with an underlying valued at €470 million. The two caps in place fix the maximum 3-month Euribor rate at 1.5% and 1.25%, respectively.

 Foreign exchange risk
 The Group is exposed to two types of foreign exchange risk:

   - A foreign exchange risk on assets resulting from the Foncia Group’s shareholdings in its Swiss subsidiaries:
###### although this risk is measured, it is not subject to specific risk management as the investments are intended to be held over the long term.

   - A foreign exchange trading risk arising on commercial and financial transactions carried out by the Group’s
###### companies in currencies other than their local currency. 

 This risk arises solely on the business of Swiss subsidiaries and concerns the Swiss franc. Since the vast majority of local transactions are carried out in Swiss francs, this risk is not material. 
 It should be noted that Foncia signed an amendment to the agreement for the loan granted by Foncia Groupe to its subsidiary Foncia Switzerland on 29 June 2018, eliminating all repayment clauses. Given that no repayments have been made and that no repayment plan has been set for the foreseeable future, this loan is now considered as a monetary item and as part of the net investment in Foncia Switzerland as quasi-equity, in accordance with IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Since this date, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the loan have been included in other comprehensive income (equity) under foreign currency translation reserves.

###### NOTE 10. LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
 Update on the UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) dispute 
 On 1 October 2014, UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) brought proceedings against Foncia Groupe before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance (regional court) seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by lessees of Foncia-managed properties who were unduly charged for receiving notices to pay (avis d’échéance). 
 More specifically, UFC is seeking payment from Foncia Groupe of an amount of €2.30 per month and per lessee over a period of five years and estimates the number of lessees concerned at 318,400, bringing the total damages to €44 million. 
 In its defence, the Group argues that the French law of 6 July 1989 on residential lease agreements, upon which basis UFC filed its claim, made no provision for class actions at the time of the alleged offence; that no law existed preventing lessees being charged for receiving notices to pay; and that this was therefore a lawful practice. 
 Oral arguments were exchanged before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance in March 2018. The decision handed down in May 2018 dismissed UFC’s claims on the grounds that they fell outside the scope of a class action. 
 UFC has appealed the decision and the hearings before the Court of Appeal are scheduled for 23 April 2020.
 The Group considers that no provision needs to be accrued in this respect in its financial statements at 31 December 2019. 
 NOTE 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 Signing of a preliminary agreement to sell Foncia Primaliance shares
 Following the 1 August 2019 signing of an agreement in principle with a major asset manager in France, the Group signed the preliminary agreement for the sale of Foncia Primaliance shares on 6 March 2020. 

 Covid-19 epidemic
 Context 
 The unprecedented public health crisis caused by the Covid-19 epidemic that has spread across the globe is affecting economies and businesses around the world and having significant impacts on all industries and geographic areas. Governments have taken steps to address the crisis. 

 The impacts of the epidemic include: 

  direct and immediate impacts on certain business activities owing to the fall in demand for certain services;
  widespread impacts such as the temporary closure of premises, disruptions in the supply chain, the unavailability of human resources and the potential liquidity difficulties of certain debtors;
  more generally, a downturn in the economy as a whole, with considerable uncertainty as to the length and severity of the disruption.


-----

###### Consequences of the impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic on the financial statements at 31 December 2019 
 Based on the situation at 31 December 2019 (i.e., limited cases of the virus and the lack of any global health warning by the World Health Organization (WHO) at that date), the Group considers that the consequences of the public health and economic crisis caused by Covid-19 relate to the 2020 financial period and do not confirm a situation existing prior to 31 December 2019, insofar as the events create a situation that did not exist at 31 December 2019 and which does not compromise the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern (the most important measures of the business continuity plan put in place by management are presented below). Accordingly, the amounts reported at 31 December 2019 may not be adjusted. 
 Consequences of the impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic on the Group’s businesses in 2020
 In accordance with the decisions taken by the government in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all Foncia Group premises (branches and head offices) are closed to the public until further notice, as well as to employees (barring exceptional cases). Real estate agents can no longer travel to sign mandates, make visits or meet with notaries.

 The general lockdown measures imposed on the French population have effectively frozen the property market and the transactions business is virtually at a standstill. Physical visits of properties are forbidden during the lockdown period and those that had been scheduled were cancelled. The rental market is also affected by the crisis, as the removal industry along with the utility vehicle rental business are severely disrupted, effectively blocking the departure and arrival of lessees. 

 The rental management market can continue to function normally from a purely administrative perspective. There is little movement in rental properties. However, there is a significant risk that fees on unpaid rent will be collected later than expected, even though rent must still be paid by law. 

 The jointly owned property management business remains and will remain fairly sheltered from the crisis, although it may generate an increased workload from an administrative, legal and commercial perspective. The chain of continuity for services continues to function, despite delays regarding joint ownership property charges. However, the Group expects a fall in revenue from incidental fees such as for transfers or renovation work. It should be noted that several ordinances have been issued by the French government to protect and support companies operating in the real estate sector. One of these ordinances concerns the guaranteed continuity of mandates for jointly owned property associations, even if they expire in the period from 12 March to 31 December 2020. 

 Without compromising the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, direct impacts are expected and have already been observed in 2020 on revenue, margins and operating cash flows relating to the transactions and lettings businesses and, to a lesser extent, to the French and international jointly owned property business. 
 Business continuity plan

  Human resources and organisation 

 The different procedures put in place to address this unprecedented environment are designed to protect the health of employees but also to ensure that a minimum and critical level of business can continue, subject to changes in government regulations: 

 • Homeworking has been introduced for all employees whose work can be performed from home and who have the necessary tools available. 

 • More specifically, in its property management and transactions network, an exceptional travel certificate has been granted to managers so that they can carry out minimum duties alongside senior executives. An exceptional, occasional travel certificate subject to restrictions has also been issued to critical employees dealing, for example, with incoming correspondence, cash inflows and payments, and handovers. 

 • For employees facing increasingly difficult working conditions such as lettings negotiators, developers or real estate consultants, short-time working arrangements have been put in place. 


-----

###### Each department is currently finalising its own organisational and communications guidelines for these exceptional circumstances using various procedures.

  Financing 
 Out of prudence, the Group made two drawdowns on its revolving credit facility on 16 and 19 March 2020 for a total of €190 million in order to secure its liquidity. Certain due dates for payments under major leases have been pushed back in order to protect cash levels, particularly in the transactions business. 

  External growth strategy

 Wherever possible, the Group has pushed back corporate sale agreements due to be signed during the lockdown period to 1 June 2020 at the earliest.

_This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditor’s report issued in French and is provided solely_
_for the convenience of English speaking readers. This report includes information specifically required by_
_European regulations or French law. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in_
_accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France._

**Foncia Management**

France

To the sole shareholder,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us pursuant to your articles of association, we have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management for the year ended
31 December 2018.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2018 and of the results of its
operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for opinion**

**_Audit framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the
Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated financial statements” section of our report.

**FONCIA MANAGEMENT**

**_Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements_**

**_For the year ended 31 December 2018 - Page 2_**

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules applicable to us, for
the period from 1 January 2018 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any
non-audit services prohibited by the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory
Auditors.

**Emphasis of matter**

Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter set out in Note 3.2.2 – Changes
in the accounting standards, to the consolidated financial statements concerning the entry into force of
IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, which are mandatorily applicable as of 1 January 2018.

**Justification of assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following
assessments that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements.

These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole,
and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate
opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

The Group tests goodwill and assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis, in
accordance with the methods presented in Notes 3.4.7 – Impairment losses on goodwill, intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment and 4.1.3 – Assumptions used in the 2018 impairment tests,
to the consolidated financial statements. We examined the methods used by the Group to test for
impairment, together with the cash flow forecasts and assumptions relied upon for that purpose. We
further verified that the notes provide appropriate disclosures. As part of our assessments, we also
ensured that the estimates used were reasonable.

**Specific verifications**

As required by legal and regulatory provisions and in accordance with professional standards
applicable in France, we have also verified the information pertaining to the Group presented in the
Chairman’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the**
**consolidated financial statements**

Management is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements giving a true and fair view
in accordance with French accounting principles and for implementing the internal control procedures

**FONCIA MANAGEMENT**

**_Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements_**

**_For the year ended 31 December 2018 - Page 3_**

it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or
to cease operations.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Supervisory Board.

**Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated**
**financial statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of
material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance
on the viability or quality of the Company’s management.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit.

They also:

  - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

  - obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to

design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

  - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements;

  - assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a
going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are

required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a
qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;

  - evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether

these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation;

  - obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities

or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. The Statutory Auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and
performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed
thereon.

(1) On 8 June 2018, the Group acquired the residual 5% stake in Foncia Deutschland Co & KG for €0.2 million,

###### bringing its interest in all of the German entities to 100%. This led to the reclassification of a negative amount of €0.9 million between non-controlling interests and equity attributable to owners of the parent. 
 In March 2018, the Group purchased the 25% stake in Somhome that it did not already own for a total purchase price of €0.1 million, bringing its interest in this company to 100%. At 31 December 2017, a liability representing the put option granted to non-controlling shareholders had been carried in the statement of financial position in an amount of €0.6 million. This liability was written back against equity (see Note 4.11 “Net debt”). 
 Lastly, on 30 November 2018 Primonial acquired a 40% equity interest in Leemo following a partial asset contribution consisting of its entire sales brokerage division for new and existing properties (see Note 2.3 of “Highlights of the period”). 

 Consideration for this contribution amounting to €7 million took the form of preferred shares that do not meet the criteria for recognition as equity instruments. Accordingly, the contribution was recognised by default within financial liabilities. Ultimately, the transaction led to the reclassification of the negative amount of €0.4 million between non-controlling interests and equity attributable to owners of the parent. 

(2) This primarily concerns the net tax effect of an adjustment made to amortisation charged against software

###### NOTE 1. GENERAL PRESENTATION

 Information concerning the Foncia Management Group
 Foncia Management is a French simplified joint stock company (société par actions simplifiée) with a sole shareholder, subject to all regulations governing commercial companies in France, and in particular the provisions of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Its registered office is located at 13 avenue Lebrun, 92160 Antony, France.

 Description of Group businesses
 Foncia Groupe is a European leader in residential property services. It assists its clients at all stages of the property life cycle, with a comprehensive, integrated service offering that includes management of jointly owned properties, round-the-clock assistance, rental management, rentals, sales, purchases, holiday lettings, appraisals, insurance, technical surveys and energy brokerage. 
 Foncia operates in France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.

 Information presented
 Statutory 2017 consolidated financial statements
 The Foncia Management Group (the “Group”) comprising Foncia Management and its subsidiaries, was created on 7 September 2016 further to the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Foncia Holding group. The Group prepared its consolidated financial statements for the first time for the period ended 31 December 2017. 
 These financial statements covered: 

   - 20 months of operations for Foncia Management, from its creation in May 2016 to 31 December 2017;

   - 16 months of operations for the Foncia Holding group, from its acquisition by Foncia Management on
###### 7 September 2016 to 31 December 2017. 
 Since this does not allow a meaningful comparison with results of operations for an equivalent 12-month period, profit and loss data for the period ended 31 December 2017 are not used as comparative data. They are included for information purposes under “2017 (presented)”. 
 Pro forma 2017 consolidated financial statements

 The pro forma 2017 results of operations include 12 months of operations for Foncia Management and the Foncia Holding group. The main accounting policies applied are the same as those applied to prepare the statutory consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management. 
 However, the Group applied IFRS 15 on revenue recognition and IFRS 9 on financial instruments for the first time in 2018. Accordingly, the first-time application impacts have been separated out for 2017 to enable a meaningful comparison. 
 The consolidated results of operations for the period ended 31 December 2017 have been restated to reflect the application of these standards as if they had been applied from 1 January 2017. These restated figures appear throughout as “2017 (restated pro forma)”. 
 2018 consolidated financial statements
 The 2018 consolidated financial statements reflect the statutory financial statements and do not contain any pro forma restatements. They have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and


-----

###### interpretations (IAS/IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at 1 January 2018. Consequently, they include the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9. 
 NOTE 2. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIOD

 External growth investments (acquisitions) and changes in the scope of consolidation
 The Group acquired 54 companies in the period, thereby continuing its acquisition-led growth. The companies concerned are mainly property management companies with the exception of Lodgis, whose furnished property rental business rounds out the Group’s commercial offering.
 None of these acquisitions are subject to any specific contingent consideration or earn-out clauses.

###### However, the number of consolidated entities is slightly lower than in the previous period owing to the various restructuring operations carried out in 2018. The list of consolidated companies is presented in Note 13.
 External growth investments represented a total of €113.2 million in 2018 (securities and business goodwill), of which €108.2 million has been disbursed and €5 million recognized in current liabilities in respect of the outstanding purchase price balances. 
 Additional goodwill arising on these acquisitions represents €81.1 million (see Note 4.1). 

 Efficity
 In April 2018, the outstanding balance of the initial earn-out negotiated at the time of the Efficity acquisition in 2015 was allocated to its historic founders and managers in an amount of €4.5 million (€5.2 million had already been paid in 2017). 
 To secure the founders’ and managers’ loyalty and their commitment to Efficity’s future development, the Group entered into a new agreement with them using a specific legal structure based on the creation of an intermediate holding company (Foncia Saturne) controlling Efficity’s entire share capital.
 The Group offered the aforementioned founders and key managers the possibility of reinvesting part of the proceeds from this earn-out in the holding company’s capital increase carried out for a total of €7 million (the historic founders invested €3 million, while the Group contributed €4 million). This reinvestment gives the founders the opportunity to realise a potential capital gain at the end of a four-year period, depending on future trends in the company’s operating performance. 


-----

###### In light of the terms and conditions of the transaction driven by the Group’s interests, the acquisition was accounted for as an extension of the initial earn-out clause. The value of the initial earn-out was therefore recalculated (to the extent of the €3 million reinvested by the founders) at the date the new agreement was signed. 

 ➢ Since the partner-founders are exposed to the risk that they may lose the capital invested if the “bad leaver”
 clause applies, non-recurring income of €3 million was recognized in the period. This income reflects the remeasurement of the initial earn-out liability (from €4.5 million to €1.5 million). 
 ➢ Efficity continues to be fully consolidated, since the Group intends to retain sole control of the entity upon
 completion of the transaction. 

 Leemo/Primonial partial asset contribution
 Overview of the transaction
 The Primonial and Foncia groups set up Leemo, a joint venture, to pool their respective skills and resources in terms of listing new and existing properties via their digital platform. 
 On 30 November 2018, Primonial acquired a 40% equity interest in Leemo (the percentage interest is subject to change depending on certain criteria owing to the preferred shares issued in consideration of the contribution – see below) through a partial asset contribution consisting of Primonial’s entire, stand-alone sales brokerage division for new and existing properties. A 10-year shareholders’ agreement was signed with the Primonial group.
 Consideration for the contribution 
 Based on an estimated value of €7 million for the division, consideration for the contribution consisted of 33,624 preferred shares each with a par value of €1, bringing Leemo’s share capital to 84,059 shares. The resulting contribution premium was €6,966,376. The contribution consisted mainly of intangible assets, which were measured by mutual agreement at €7 million. 
 Conversion of preferred shares 
 Besides carrying the same rights as ordinary shares, preferred shares may also be automatically converted into ordinary shares in 2021 in a proportion based on the “outperformance” achieved, as assessed according to changes in the respective contributions of the Primonial and Foncia groups to Leemo’s net revenue. 
 An analysis of each group’s contribution could allow either (i) Primonial to increase its interest in Leemo to a maximum of 48,457 shares (49% of the share capital), or (ii) Foncia to collect up to €2 million in cash compensation.
 Accounting treatment applied 
 Based on the majority shareholding in Leemo and the governance arrangements in place, the Group decided that it retained sole control of Leemo and that it would therefore continue to fully consolidate the company. 

 The basis on which preferred shares may be converted also led the Group to consider that the financial asset adopted as consideration for the contribution (ordinary shares after conversion) did not represent a fixed basis for the exchange at 31 December 2018. Accordingly, it cannot demonstrate that a fixed number of ordinary shares will be offered as consideration for the aforementioned preferred shares. 
 From the perspective of applicable accounting standards and IAS 32 in particular, this consideration prevents the preferred shares from being recognised as equity instruments. The preferred shares are therefore classified as financial liabilities by default. 
 At 31 December 2018, considering that the “neutral” scenario was most likely, the liability was measured at 40% of Leemo’s enterprise value, i.e., €7 million, and was classified within non-current borrowings.

###### Implementation of a free share plan by Foncia Stark
 Characteristics of the plan:

 - Grant date: 23 May 2018  - Date on which the continuing employment condition is assessed: 23 May 2020  - Vesting period for the shares: between 23 May 2018 and 23 May 2020 - Maximum number of shares awarded: up to 205,000 free shares in the company, representing 5.125% of its share capital - Maximum aggregate amount of the free share plan: €410,000 - The shares awarded are monetised through a new liquidity contract which prices the share using a calculation formula. - Corporate social contribution (forfait social): 20% of the free share plan
 The value of the free shares awarded represents discretionary compensation granted to employees. Since a liquidity contract has been set up, the shares awarded to beneficiaries will be settled in cash. The free share plan therefore meets the definition of a “cash-settled” plan set out in IFRS 2. Consequently, the service cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period against a related liability. 
 At 31 December 2018, the service cost amounted to €149,000 and was recognized within capitalised production with an adjusting entry to employee-related payables. It will be amortised as from the date the “Millenium” project (development of new management software for the property management network) enters into service. The service cost will be reviewed each year in light of budget assumptions and turnover. 

 Debt restructuring
 On 18 July and 3 August 2018, the Group restructured its borrowings with its lenders in order to secure better interest terms.

 (i) Modification of the ICA tranche on 18 July 2018 

 - Reduction of 50 bps in the applicable margin: the “cash margin” is reduced from 7.5% to 7%, while the “PIK margin” is reduced from 8.5% to 8%.  - Elimination of the 3-month Euribor 1% floor: in the current negative interest rate environment, the E3M benchmark rate is therefore reduced to 0%.  - Elimination of applicable 2% penalties in the event of early repayment as from 18 July 2019. 

 (ii) Partial repayment of the ICA loan on 3 August 2018 

 Repayment of €77 million of this loan. The related fees for early repayment amount to €1.5 million.

 (iii) Subscription of a new €80 million tranche (“B4”) of the senior facility
 The financing terms applicable to this B4 tranche are identical to those applicable to the B3 tranche renegotiated in March 2017 (see Note 4.11.3). The issuance fees for the new tranche amount to €1.25 million and will be recognised over the term of the facility by an adjustment to financial expenses at the effective interest rate as calculated at 3 August 2018 (3.68%). 
 IFRS 9 accounting treatment 
 From an accounting perspective, this restructuring is part of an overall initiative to optimise the Group’s borrowing costs. The modifications were therefore analysed as a whole to determine whether they are substantial and therefore ascertain the appropriate accounting treatment to be used. 


-----

###### Based on this analysis, using both quantitative and qualitative tests, there were substantial modifications to the initial terms of the ICA loan. As a result, the initial accounting treatment was discontinued, with all related unamortised expenses charged to profit or loss in an amount of €4 million. The fees due on early repayment were immediately expensed in an amount of €1.5 million. 

 Economic and Social Unit (UES)
 On 21 August 2018, in response to strong employee demand for a single and harmonized framework within which to exercise their duties, the Versailles Tribunal d’Instance recognised the existence of an Economic and Social Unit (Unité Économique et Sociale – UES) between the various legal entities belonging to the network comprising the Property Management France/Transactions businesses, plus Foncia Carrières et Compétences (124 companies at 21 August 2018). This decision signals the start of a new, inclusive modus operandi as the basis for implementing the Group’s growth strategy and securing the commitment of all employees within its network.

###### NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS

 General principles used to prepare the financial statements
 The accounting policies described in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the standards adopted as described in Note 3.2.2, effective as of 1 January 2018, including those relating to the first-time application of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments.
 The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for assets held for sale and related liabilities, measured in accordance with IFRS 5, and certain financial instruments carried at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9. 
 The consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management at 31 December 2018 were adopted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting of 11 April 2019, and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the General Meeting on 29 June 2019. 
 They are presented in thousands of euros and amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest thousand unless otherwise specified. Consequently, the sum of these amounts may differ slightly from the total amounts reported.

 Accounting standards

 3.2.1. Basis of preparation of financial information
 Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 297/2008 of 11 March 2008, the 2018 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at 1 January 2018. The full text of the standards adopted by the European Union can be consulted on the European Commission’s website: 
 https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting_en
 At the end of the reporting period, there was no difference between the IFRS used to prepare these financial statements and the standards adopted by the IASB and applicable for the period presented.
 The accounting policies and bases of measurement applied to prepare these consolidated financial statements are described in Note 3.4 below. 

 3.2.2. Changes in accounting standards
 Main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations in force within the European Union and mandatorily applicable as of 1 January 2018
 The accounting policies and bases of measurement used by the Group to prepare its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 are identical to those used by the Group at 31 December 2017, with the exception of:

   - IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers

###### On 28 May 2014, the IASB published IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which impacts the timing of revenue recognition by the Group. IFRS 15 sets out a single model framework to account for revenue arising on contracts with customers. According to the fundamental principle of the new standard, revenue is recognised based on when the goods and services promised in the contract are provided to the customer, and for the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange.


-----

###### IFRS 15 sets out a five-step model framework for recognising and measuring revenue. The new standard, which replaces IAS 18, was not early adopted by the Group.
 It was applied retrospectively at 1 January 2018 using the simplified retrospective transition method, i.e., the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 15 is recognised at 1 January 2018 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity. Accordingly, equity at 31 December 2017 has been restated for the impacts of IFRS 15. A summary of the impacts of IFRS 15 on each line of the statement of financial position is provided below.

###### In accordance with the simplified retrospective method, the Group recognised the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 was only applied to contracts in force at 1 January 2018.
 Summary of the estimated impacts of applying IFRS 15 on pro forma profit (loss) for 2017 (12 months)
 In accordance with the simplified retrospective method, IFRS 15 is applicable only to contracts in force at the date of first-time application. This results in two non-comparable revenue figures: revenue as determined under IFRS 15 and revenue as determined under IAS 18. Accordingly, the Group has decided to also present the impacts that IFRS 15 would have had on profit (loss) for the 2017 reporting period, as compared with IAS 18. For comparative purposes, all data presented in relation to profit (loss) for the 2017 reporting period has been restated for the impacts of IFRS 15.

###### • Rental: Revenue is recognised at the time of the moving-in inventory. Until 2017, revenue was recognised upon
 signature of the lease. 
 • Transactions business/Efficity: Revenue on the Transactions business is now recognised upon signature of the
 notarial deed (acte authentique). It was previously recognised when the conditions precedent set out in the sales agreement had been met. Sales recorded at the end of the 2017 reporting period were reversed at the start of the period and recognised in 2018 at the date on which the agreement was signed. Revenue generated by these two businesses in the 2017 reporting period, as restated for IFRS 15, represents €124.8 million, which is consistent with the operating data on revenue collected in 2017.

###### At the level of operating profit, only variable costs directly attributable to the restated revenue were taken into account, i.e., fees and commission, advance fee and commission payments, the related social security contributions and bonuses paid to business providers. From an accounting standpoint, the Group considers that wages and other fixed costs would have remained the same irrespective of the restated revenue, in the same way as transaction bonuses and premiums calculated on the basis of signed notarial deeds only. 
 • Assurimo: Revenue is recorded over the term of the contract, since services in this brokerage business are provided
 on a straight-line basis. Up to 2017, revenue was chiefly recognised when customers were invoiced for insurance premiums (mostly at the end of the year). Revenue restated for IFRS 15 was calculated based on recognition on a straight-line basis applying a stable seasonality factor equal to 8% of total revenue.

   - IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments

###### On 24 July 2014, the IASB published a new standard on financial instruments replacing most of the existing provisions under IFRS, and particularly IAS 39. The Group did not early adopt IFRS 9. 
 The requirements of the standard in terms of the classification, measurement and impairment of financial instruments are applied by the Group retrospectively, with no adjustments to information for comparative periods. 

 • Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities 
 IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and liabilities based on the entity’s business model and the applicable contractual terms. 
 Under IFRS 9, all equity instruments should be measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, with gains and losses either taken to profit or loss or recognised through other comprehensive income in accordance with an option taken by the entity that cannot subsequently be revoked. In this case, only dividends will tend to be recognised in profit or loss. 
 The Group has reviewed and measured its financial assets at 1 January 2018 in light of the facts and circumstances existing at that date, and considers that the first-time application of IFRS 9 would not have a material impact on the classification and measurement of the items concerned. The only impact is on the Group’s shareholdings in Swiss property companies and cooperatives, some of which were sold during the year. 
 Classified as held to maturity under IAS 39 (and therefore carried at amortised cost), these shareholdings have been reclassified within equity instruments carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. In this respect, they were remeasured at 1 January in an amount of €685,000, with an adjusting entry posted to total equity.
 Concerning the measurement of financial liabilities, IFRS 9 introduces very few changes to the requirements that existed under IAS 39, and no impacts were identified as a result of the new standard in the 2018 financial statements. 
 The Group had analysed its debt repricing operations in 2017 in light of the principles of IAS 39 but also taking into account the changes introduced by IFRS 9. Accordingly, the first-time application of IFRS 9 did not have any retrospective impact in the 2018 financial statements in this respect.

 • Phase 2: Impairment
 As a basis for financial asset impairment, IFRS 9 requires use of an expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model under IAS 39. The expected loss model requires entities to recognise expected losses on its receivables, with any changes in these losses to be recognised at the end of each reporting period in order to reflect changes in the credit risk since initial recognition. 


-----

###### Since impairment is not material in the Group’s B-to-C business, no changes were made to the accounting policies used to recognise impairment provisions. The Group is exposed to limited bad debt risk on its commercial receivables as the risk is concentrated mainly in Foncia IPM’s operations, which accounts for less than 4% of consolidated revenue. 

 • Phase 3: Hedge accounting
 The new requirements for general hedge accounting maintain the three hedging categories identified under IAS 39. IFRS 9 offers greater flexibility as regards transactions that may be eligible for hedge accounting, particularly in terms of instruments that may be designated as hedging instruments and the type of risks that may be hedged in a non-financial hedge. The hedge effectiveness test has also been revised and replaced by the notion of an “economic relationship” between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is no longer required. Broader disclosure requirements for entities in terms of risk management have also been introduced. 
 The Group does not use instruments meeting the definition of hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

   - Amendments to IFRS 4 – Applying IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” with IFRS 4 “Insurance Contracts”

   - Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2014-2016 cycle

###### The first-time application of these standards, amendments and interpretations does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 Other new standards and guidance applicable after 1 January 2019 and not early adopted by the Group

   - IFRS 16 – Leases

###### IFRS 16, the new standard on leases, was published on 13 January 2016 and will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and any related IFRIC and SIC interpretations. 
 The new standard no longer applies a distinction between operating and finance leases. Accordingly, the Group will be required to recognise in its statement of financial position all of its lease obligations within the meaning of IFRS 16 in the same manner as currently required under IAS 17 for finance leases. The rights and obligations resulting from a lease contract will therefore be recognised in assets and liabilities, respectively, rather than in off-balance sheet commitments as is currently the case for operating leases. 
 The Group will apply IFRS 16 for the first time at 1 January 2019 using a simplified retrospective approach, with no restatement of comparative figures.
 The Group has a large number of leases across its entire French and international branch network. There are many different types of leases, from property leases to vehicle leases. The first-time application of IFRS 16 will therefore have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 To prepare for its first-time application of the standard, the Group has been functionally assisted by an external service provider in charge of leading and coordinating the project at the level of all affected divisions (finance, operations, property). The project has involved: 

 - compiling data on leases for the France scope;  - reviewing the data compiled for the international scope;  - analysing data reliability based on a sample of different contract types; - validating the scope of application of the standard and its exclusions; 


-----

###### - calculating the Group’s incremental borrowing rates;  - quantifying the impacts;  - identifying criteria and options affecting the measurement of lease assets.
 All leases concerned by the standard have now been identified and their data analysed. In 2019, around 705 property leases in France will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16, including 281 contracts which are automatically renewable. This figure does not include any new leases that may begin in 2019, including those resulting from acquisitions. 
 The exemptions provided for by the standard as regards short-term leases (with a term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets will not be applied. 
 The Group is currently reviewing quantified estimates of the IFRS 16 impact.

   - Amendment to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

   - Amendment to IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business

   - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material

###### These standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted or are in the process of being adopted by the European Union. Subject to their adoption, they are applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group is currently analysing the potential impacts of applying the requirements set out in these texts for the first time.

 Use of management estimates in applying the Group’s accounting standards
 The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the measurement and presentation of certain assets and liabilities and any disclosures provided in respect of contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. 
 Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given the circumstances. 
 These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Where applicable, a sensitivity analysis may be performed if the estimates are material. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 The estimates made by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. 
 ▪ Measurements used in testing goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment
 The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. 


-----

###### As with any estimate, the assumptions used in these calculations are partly based on uncertain factors and may therefore need to be adjusted in subsequent periods. Note 4.1.3 sets out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same note. 
 ▪ Measurement of provisions

 The Group used the best estimate of its commitments and obligations to calculate the corresponding provisions.
 ▪ Measurement of employee benefits 

 The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. 
 Note 4.12 sets out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. 
 ▪ Measurement of fair value (Level 1)

 The Group uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure unlisted derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents (see Notes 3.4.18 and 4.18). 

 ▪ Measurement of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax expense
 The Group’s tax position (see Notes 4.8 and 5.11) is based on its best estimate of future taxable earnings.
 ▪ Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business
 combination

 The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount. 
 ▪ Assessment of criteria for identifying discontinued operations
 In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the Group is required to exercise judgement in determining whether an asset or group of assets meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. IFRS 5 criteria are also used to identify any assets to be classified as discontinued operations. These assessments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in light of changes in the relevant facts and circumstances.
 In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, the Group uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements:

 ▪ present a true and fair view of the Foncia Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows;

 ▪ reflect the economic substance of transactions;

 ▪ are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects.
 Detailed disclosures in this regard are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.


-----

###### Basis of measurement

 3.4.1. Basis of consolidation
 The financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using the same accounting policies and over the same period as those of the parent company. 
 Controlled entities 
 Companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or is entitled, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity in question and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Control is analysed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the inputs used to assess control has changed.
 A subsidiary is consolidated as from the date control is acquired, which is usually upon signature of the share transfer and disposal agreements (see “Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period” below). Consolidation ceases when control is relinquished. 
 Any interest in the subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recognised within non-controlling interests. Profits and losses and each component of other comprehensive income relating to subsidiaries are allocated to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
 Changes in the percentage interest held in subsidiaries that do not lead to a change in control are treated as equity transactions, since the transactions take place between owners acting in their capacity as owners. The impact of these transactions is shown in equity net of tax and does not therefore impact consolidated profit or loss. These transactions are also shown in the statement of cash flows under cash flows relating to investing activities.
 Investments in equity-accounted companies (associates and joint ventures) 
 Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling those policies.
 A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
 Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s interest in the profits, losses and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. 
 IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments is applied to determine whether investments in associates or joint ventures need to be tested for impairment. Where necessary, the total carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets. 
 Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period 
 Non-consolidated investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and mainly consist of shares in property management companies that will subsequently be consolidated.


-----

###### Before acquiring shares in a property management company, the Group agrees to acquire the shares and pays 10% of the estimated price to the seller. This part payment is included in “Downpayments on acquisitions of securities” within non-current financial assets. The remaining 90% is booked in “Off-balance sheet commitments” (see Note 9). 
 Upon signing the share transfer or disposal agreement, the Group pays an additional 70% of the estimated price to the seller. The estimated purchase price is included in equity investments, and the part payment already recognised is also reclassified to this caption. The acquired company is then consolidated. 
 Following a review of the acquired company’s financial statements, the Group pays the remaining balance and adjusts the purchase price of the shares. 
 Non-consolidated investments 
 Companies with the following characteristics are not included in the scope of consolidation:

 ▪ they are in the process of being wound up or are dormant;

 ▪ their business is not strategic for the Group.
 In accordance with IFRS 9, non-consolidated investments are carried at fair value. There are no material obligations or liabilities relating to these entities.

 3.4.2. Elimination of intragroup transactions
 All intragroup transactions and balances as well as any income, expenses, gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions and included in the carrying amount of assets are eliminated on consolidation.
 When a Group entity carries out a transaction with a joint venture or associate, the related gains and losses are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the interests held by third parties in the joint venture or associate. 

 3.4.3. Foreign currency translation
 Presentation currency
 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
 Functional currency and translation of the financial statements of foreign companies
 A consolidated entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the local currency. However, certain entities must adopt a functional currency other than their local currency when that currency represents the currency of the major transactions carried out by the entity and accurately reflects its economic environment. 
 The financial statements of foreign entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are translated using the “closing rate” method. 
 Under this method, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period, while profit and loss and cash flow items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting currency translation differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income within equity under “Translation adjustments”. 
 Goodwill relating to foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro are treated as assets acquired or liabilities assumed and therefore translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. 


-----

###### Foreign currency transactions
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedged rate. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the closing exchange rate, with the resulting gains and losses included in foreign exchange gains and losses under other financial income and expenses in the statement of profit and loss. 
 Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined.

 3.4.4. Business combinations and goodwill
 In accordance with the revised IFRS 3, business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. According to this method, assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed that meet the recognition criteria under the revised IFRS 3 are measured at fair value.
 Goodwill is measured as the difference between the consideration transferred (purchase price plus the fair value of any previously-held interest and the value of any non-controlling interests) and the estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. It is recorded under “Goodwill” in the statement of financial position. 
 Goodwill is calculated on a provisional basis at the time of the acquisition and is adjusted within 12 months of the acquisition date. 
 When the business combination is a bargain purchase, negative goodwill is identified. The corresponding gain is included in profit or loss in the period of the acquisition. 
 For each business combination, the Group may choose to account for non-controlling interests: 

   - either at acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of goodwill on the non-controlling interests
###### (“full goodwill” method);

   - or based on the share of net identifiable assets of the acquired entity measured at fair value, in which case
###### goodwill is only recognised on the portion attributable to owners of the parent (“partial goodwill” method).
 If the business combination is carried out in stages, the acquisition-date carrying amount of the previously-held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date.  Any resulting gains or losses are taken to profit or loss.
 In the event of deferred settlements, the future amounts payable are discounted to present value at the settlement date. The discount rate used is the same as that used to estimate the value of the assets.
 Any adjustments to the potential price are estimated at acquisition-date fair value. The initial measurement may only subsequently be adjusted against goodwill if new information is obtained arising from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date and to the extent that the measurement is still provisional (maximum measurement period of 12 months). Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price not meeting these criteria are included in liabilities or receivables, with an offsetting entry to profit or loss.
 During the 12-month measurement period, changes to the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed relating to recognised acquisitions are treated as retrospective adjustments to goodwill. After the end of the measurement period, changes to the estimated value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognised in profit or loss, with no adjustment to goodwill.


-----

###### In accordance with the revised IFRS 3, costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The value of goodwill is reviewed each year and may also be impaired (see Note 3.4.7). 
 Earn-out payment
 The revised IFRS 3 gives certain indications as regards the accounting for contingent payment arrangements with employees or selling shareholders. These arrangements may be part of the business combination or may be considered as separate from the acquisition agreement for the target entity. In certain acquisitions, earn-out payments were considered part of the consideration for post-acquisition services rendered and are therefore expensed in the periods concerned and in future periods.

 3.4.5. Intangible assets
 Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets with no physical substance. 
 In accordance with IAS 38, intangible assets that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost when the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are carried at fair value separately from goodwill. 
 Intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite useful life (software and licences) are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives: 

   - Client relationships: 18-21 years

   - Software programs: 1-10 years

   - Other intangible assets: 5 years

###### Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. They are included with other assets within cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment using the discounted cash flow method at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. 
 When the recoverable amount of these assets calculated based on criteria prevailing at the acquisition date falls below their carrying amount, an impairment provision is recorded. 

 Trademarks
 Identifiable trademarks are measured using a multi-criteria approach which takes into consideration both their reputation and profitability. 
 The Group classified its main “Foncia” trademark along with the “Trévi” trademark in Belgium and the “Domicim” and “Brolliet” trademarks in Switzerland as indefinite-lived intangible assets. 

 Business software programs
 Software acquired is carried at cost (purchase price plus ancillary expenses). When allocating the purchase price, certain software programs may also be measured using the replacement cost approach.

 Business goodwill and client relationships
 Client relationships include the list of mandates held by the Group’s companies. A mandate is an instrument by which a person (the principal) gives another person (the agent) the power of proxy. France’s Hoguet Law requires


-----

###### professional property agents to hold a written mandate in order to put properties up for sale or let, and to manage property.
 Client relationships are measured based on the excess earnings method.

 Other intangible assets
 Other intangible assets mainly comprise the cost of acquiring new business.

 3.4.6. Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment are measured at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including customs duties and non-recoverable taxes, and any costs directly incurred to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the purchase price. Subsequent expenditure is recognised in expenses, unless it improves the asset’s initial performance, prolongs its useful life, or reduces the operating costs previously determined.
 Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives. In accordance with IAS 16, property, plant and equipment are recognised using the component approach, with each component depreciated separately over its useful life: 

   - Buildings: 20-50 years

   - Fixtures and fittings: 8-10 years

   - IT equipment: 4 years

   - Vehicle fleet: 5 years

   - Furniture: 10 years

   - Office equipment: 4 years

###### Useful lives are reviewed each year and may be adjusted if expectations differ from previous estimates.
 Gains and losses on asset disposals are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset concerned.

 3.4.7. Impairment losses on goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
 The carrying amounts of non-current non-financial assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in order to identify any potential impairment: 

   - goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually and
###### whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired;

   - all other assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired.

###### External indicators of impairment include changes in the general economic and financial environment, downtrends in local economic environments and changes in economic performance. These are analysed by the Group to determine whether the assets concerned should be tested for impairment more frequently. 

 For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs ) or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies arising on the business combination.  The Group decides whether or not to recognise an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities in a CGU or group of CGUs with their recoverable amount. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets for internal management purposes. 


-----

###### The Group has identified the following three CGUs corresponding to its major development and investment strategies:

   - Property management companies – France

   - Property management companies – International

   - Other activities (service companies and other entities)

###### The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value (generally market price) less costs to sell and its value in use. 
 Fair value less costs to sell is calculated based on available information used to establish the best estimate of the selling price net of costs to sell in an arm’s length transaction between fully informed, willing parties. 
 Value in use as calculated by the Group generally corresponds to the present value of the future cash flows attributable to a CGU or group of CGUs, taking into account their residual value and based on the most probable assumptions adopted by management. 
 The assumptions used are based on the budgets and business plans prepared by management for each business. These budgets are the latest budgets approved by the Supervisory Board at the date of preparation of the financial statements. Other assumptions affecting the calculation of the recoverable amount include the growth rate, operating margin, the discount rate and the tax rate (see Note 4.1).
 The discount rate used to discount post-tax cash flows to their present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Where there is no specific discount rate for the assets tested, the average cost of capital is used. The discount rates are post-tax rates and are applied to post-tax cash flows. The recoverable amount calculated using post-tax discount rates is equal to that which would have been obtained using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36. 
 If the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the related assets are written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and then to the carrying amount of the other assets of the CGU, in proportion to their carrying amount. This must not result in the carrying amount of an individual asset falling below the higher of its fair value, value in use and zero. Impairment losses are recognised in other operating expenses and may not be reversed. 

 3.4.8. Financial assets
 The measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities is defined by the new IFRS 9 – Financial instruments.
 Unlike IAS 39, IFRS 9 applies a single analytical framework to all financial assets in order to determine the classification and basis of measurement to be used for accounting purposes. The four IAS 39 categories have been replaced by three categories, each associated with a specific measurement approach.
 More specifically: 

 ✓ Debt instruments held in a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows that are solely
 payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, are generally carried at amortised cost. 
 ✓ Debt instruments held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
 flows (whose contractual conditions give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest [SPPI] on the principal amount outstanding) and selling financial assets, are typically carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
 ✓ All other debt and equity instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. 


-----

###### A summary of these new financial asset classification and measurement requirements is set out below:

###### Operating leases
 Payments made under operating leases are expensed in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental income is included in income on a straight-line basis.

 Finance leases
 The Group acquires certain property, plant and equipment used in its operations under finance leases. These assets are recognised in assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.
 In accordance with IAS 17, assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, with a matching entry to liabilities for the equivalent value of the assets. The Group subsequently applies the cost model rather than the remeasurement approach, in accordance with IAS 16 and IAS 38.
 Payments under finance leases recognised in the annual financial statements are restated to reflect the gradual reduction in the liability and the fixed or floating-rate interest intrinsic to the lease. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the same periods as assets of a similar nature that are acquired directly.

 3.4.10. Cash and cash equivalents
 The amount shown in cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position includes cash at bank and cash equivalents (short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value). 
 Short-term investments are remeasured at market value at the end of each reporting period. 
 Investments in listed equities, investments with an initial maturity of over three months and no early exit option and restricted (i.e., blocked) bank accounts are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and classified as current or non-current financial assets. 
 Short-term bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings within current liabilities in the statement of financial position


-----

###### For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents include the items defined above, net of short-term bank overdrafts. 

 3.4.11. Client accounts 
 Under their mandates, property management companies hold client funds consisting of guarantee deposits received, rent and expenses, joint ownership working capital and renovation funds, and funds received in connection with the Transactions business. As an agent, the Group undertakes to hold client accounts and to recognise them for each activity (transactions, rentals and management).

 3.4.12. Recognition and measurement of financial liabilities
 Borrowings are initially measured at the fair value of the amount received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. 

 Borrowings
 After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments to the net carrying amount of the financial liability in order to determine its amortised cost.

 Other financial liabilities
 Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost.

 3.4.13. Derivative instruments
 The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks on floating-rate borrowings and foreign exchange risks. 
 In accordance with IFRS, hedge accounting may be applied to a hedging transaction provided that:

   - the hedge is documented (entity’s objectives, hedging strategy, identification of the components of the
###### hedging relationship, etc.);

   - the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. A
###### hedge is highly effective if it meets all of the following hedge effectiveness criteria:

 - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument,

 - the credit risk is not of a magnitude that it dominates the value changes that result from the economic relationship,

 - the hedge ratio is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item;

   - effectiveness can be measured reliably and is calculated in the context of continuing operations.

###### For the periods presented, no interest rate or foreign currency derivatives used by the Group are classified as hedging instruments. 

 In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, derivative instruments are measured on the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in the fair value of instruments not eligible for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss under other financial income and expenses.


-----

###### 3.4.14. Current and non-current provisions
 A provision is recognised when, at the end of the reporting period, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party resulting from a past event that is likely to give rise to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
 When the Group expects partial or full repayment of the provision, for example owing to an insurance policy, the repayment is booked as a separate asset but only if such repayment is virtually certain. 
 Since provisions are estimated based on assumptions regarding future contingencies and expenses, the amount thereof is based partly on uncertain factors and may be adjusted in future periods. The impact of discounting is taken into account only if it is material.
 Items giving rise to provisions (trade and labour disputes, etc.) are reviewed regularly to allow for any adjustments. The amount accrued in provisions represents the Group’s best estimate of the net outflow of resources.
 Provisions may also be recognised for contingent liabilities arising on business combinations. In this case, they are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. At the end of subsequent reporting periods, they are measured at the higher of the amount recognized in accordance with IAS 37 and the amount recorded on initial recognition, less any cumulative income recognised in accordance with IFRS 15.
 Employee-related provisions (labour disputes, lay-offs, etc.)
 At the end of each reporting period, a provision is recognised and adjusted in line with the risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Human Resources department on a case-by-case basis.
 Provisions for rent payment guarantees
 A rent payment guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. Foncia bears the cost of any unpaid rent and advances to owners. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts (deriving from the del credere agreement) and are accounted for as follows:

   - the related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are deducted
###### from rents in the same way as basic fees;

   - once rent is reported as unpaid, a provision is recorded, calculated in accordance with IAS 37.

###### The Group has set up a provision for risks relating to rent payment guarantees based on a progressive provisioning rate that increases in line with the age of the debt. 
 Provision for occupancy guarantees
 An occupancy guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. 
 Provision for URSSAF social security audits
 A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the related risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Payroll department on a case-by-case basis.


-----

###### Provisions for risks on client accounts
 A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the risk exposure on customer accounts (debit accounts, etc.), as assessed by the Group’s Customer Operations department on a case-by-case basis.
 Provisions for third party and professional liability
 These provisions are recorded based on information provided by senior managers in charge of monitoring claims against the Group. The Audit, Legal and Accounting departments have the final decision in terms of whether or not to record a provision.
 Provisions for other disputes
 These provisions are intended to cover disputes, litigation and other foreseeable contingencies in connection with the Group’s businesses, along with miscellaneous contingencies and expenses.
 Update on the UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) dispute 
 On 1 October 2014, UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) brought proceedings against Foncia Groupe before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance (regional court) seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by lessees of Foncia-managed properties who were unduly charged for receiving notices to pay (avis d’échéance).
 More specifically, UFC is seeking payment from Foncia Groupe of an amount of €2.30 per month and per lessee over a period of five years and estimates the number of lessees concerned at 318,400, bringing the total damages to €44 million. 
 In its defence, the Group argues that the French law of 6 July 1989 on residential lease agreements, upon the basis of which UFC filed its claim, made no provision for class actions at the time of the alleged offence; that no law existed preventing the company from charging lessees for receiving notices to pay; and that this was therefore a lawful practice. 
 Oral arguments were exchanged before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance in March 2018. The decision handed down in May 2018 dismissed UFC’s claims on the grounds that they fell outside the scope of a class action. UFC has appealed this decision and the case is pending hearings before the Court of Appeal. 

 The Group considers that no provision needs to be accrued in this respect in its financial statements at 31 December 2018. 
 Update on the dispute with franchisees 
 Certain franchisees brought proceedings against Foncia after having been notified that their contracts would not be renewed. They accuse the Group of wrongful termination and various breaches of the franchise agreements. Of the 19 initial lawsuits in 2014, Foncia either settled (most sensitive disputes), or won (before the lower court or on appeal) the cases. Only eight franchisees took their case to the Cour de Cassation (supreme court), which partially struck down the appeal rulings that had found in favour of Foncia. 
 The eight cases therefore face a retrial before a court of appeal to which the case has been referred. The decisions are expected in early 2020.

 At 31 December 2018, the provision set aside in respect of these disputes represented €1.1 million. 


-----

###### 3.4.15. Provisions for employee benefits

 Share-based payment
 As indicated in the “Highlights of the period” section, a free share plan was set up by Foncia Stark on 23 May 2018. The main characteristics of the plan along with the accounting treatment applied are explained in Note 2.4. 
 There are no stock option or free share plans in place at Foncia Management.

 Pensions and other post-employment benefits
 Short-term benefits 
 Short-term benefits (wages and salaries, payroll taxes, paid leave, etc.) are expensed in the period in which the corresponding services are provided by the employee. Any amounts not paid at the end of the reporting period are carried in current liabilities.
 Post-employment benefits 
 In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which the Group operates, Foncia participates in, or operates, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Virtually all of the Group’s employees are entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by the Foncia Group to the beneficiaries when the rights allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds funded in accordance with the applicable obligations and government regulations.

   - Defined contribution plans

###### Defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans are expensed as incurred in the statement of profit and loss.

   - Defined benefit plans

###### Defined benefit plans may be funded by investments in various instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds. Pension obligations and expenses are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
 This method is based on assumptions that are reviewed on a yearly basis, including the probability that the employee will remain in the Group until retirement, expected future salary trends, life expectancy and an appropriate discount rate for each of the countries in which the Group operates a pension plan. 
 The assumptions used in respect of 2018 are detailed in Note 4.12. 
 A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position for the difference between the related projected benefit obligation (actuarial liability) and any plan assets as measured at fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses.
 Expenses under defined benefit plans comprise three components, accounted for as described below:

 - Service cost is recognised in personnel costs. It includes service cost for the period, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments, which are recognised in full in profit or loss for the period in which they arose, and gains and losses arising on plan settlements.

 - Interest cost is recognised in other financial income and expenses and reflects the impact of discounting the obligations, net of the expected return on plan assets as measured using the discount rate applied to calculate those obligations.


-----

###### - Gains and losses on remeasuring the benefit obligation (plan asset) are recognised in other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss, and essentially comprise actuarial gains and losses, i.e., changes in the benefit obligation and in plan assets attributable to changes in assumptions and experience adjustments. Experience adjustments represent the difference between the expected impact of certain actuarial assumptions applied to previous measurements of the obligation and actual experience.
 If plan assets exceed the benefit obligation, a financial asset is recorded up to the amount of the present value of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
 Other benefits: long-service awards
 In France, the collective bargaining agreement for the real estate industry stipulates that all active employees who so request are entitled to one month’s salary at every anniversary date: after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of professional experience. Professional experience is considered overall and not as experience solely within the Group. However, the Group is only liable for the amount proportionate to the employee’s seniority in the Group.
 The Group’s obligation under long-service awards is assessed each year by an independent expert. 
 The assumptions used in respect of 2018 are detailed in Note 4.12. 

 3.4.16. Income tax
 Income tax for the period includes current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income. 
 The Group calculates its current taxes in accordance with the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which its earnings are taxable. Current tax expense is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable profit. However, management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax authorities.
 Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on: 

   - all temporary differences between the tax base and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, excluding
###### goodwill; 

   - tax loss carryforwards.

###### Deferred tax is calculated based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability settled.
 Deferred tax assets arising on temporary differences or on tax losses and tax credits carried forward are only recognised to the extent it is probable that they will reverse and that the Group will generate future taxable profit against which they can be utilised.
 The following are taken into account when assessing the Group’s ability to recover these assets: 

   - forecasts of future taxable earnings;

   - taxable earnings in previous years.

###### Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the entity has a right to set off a current tax asset against a current tax liability and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same tax entity or on different tax entities when there is an intention to settle the amounts on a net basis.


-----

###### In accordance with the CNC (Conseil National de la Comptabilité – former French accounting standards-setter) position statement published on 14 January 2010, the Group has used its judgement in determining how to treat the CVAE (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée) tax assessed on value added in France. The Group considers that since the base for the CVAE tax is the difference between income and expenses, the tax falls within the scope of IAS 12. Accordingly, the CVAE tax is included under “Income tax benefit (expense)”.

 3.4.17. Current liabilities
 Current liabilities are liabilities to be settled or renegotiated within the ordinary operating cycle or within 12 months following the end of the reporting period.
 Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts shown in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable estimates of their market value. The value of items that will be paid over the long term is discounted.

 3.4.18. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value
 The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the end of the reporting period, either for accounting purposes or for disclosure in the notes. 
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 IFRS 13 sets out a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value:

   - Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

   - Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
###### liability, either directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., price-based inputs).

   - Level 3: inputs relating to the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable
###### inputs).

 The Group primarily uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, cash management financial assets and identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination. 
 The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 4.18. 

 3.4.19. Assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations
 IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations sets forth the accounting requirements applicable to assets held for sale, along with the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations.
 A non-current asset or disposal group is held for sale when its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. 
 The assets and liabilities concerned are reclassified in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, and no offsetting is permitted. Assets reclassified in this category are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their carrying amount, i.e., at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortisation and impairment losses, and are no longer depreciated/amortised.
 A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major line of business and meets the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale or has been sold by the Group.


-----

###### Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line in the statement of profit and loss for the periods presented, which shows post-tax profit or loss attributable to discontinued operations and the post-tax gain or loss on the disposal or the measurement to fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups comprising the discontinued operation.
 Similarly, cash flows attributable to discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods presented.
 A discontinued operation can also be defined as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and:
 ▪ represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; 

 ▪ is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or

 ▪ is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

 3.4.20. Presentation of the statement of profit and loss
 As allowed under IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements, the Group has chosen to present operating expenses by nature.
 “Recurring operating profit (loss)”, “Operating profit (loss)”, “Cost of gross debt” and “Cost of net debt” in the statement of profit and loss and gains and losses recognised directly in equity are presented in accordance with the criteria set out in ANC Recommendation No. 2013-03 issued by the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables).

 3.4.21. Revenue
 Revenue corresponds to proceeds from sales of goods and services within the scope of the ordinary operations of fully consolidated companies. 
 All revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes. 
 In accordance with the new IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity, and specific criteria are met by each of the Group’s businesses.
 Negotiation fees and commission (sales and rentals) are recognised in revenue when they are received or effectively due at the end of the reporting period. Interest income arising on client funds is also booked in revenue.

 3.4.22. Recurring operating profit (loss)
 Recurring operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, with the exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses)”.
 Recurring operating profit (loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes all items included in operating profit (loss) restated for any non-recurring items. Costs relating to business combinations or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit (loss).

 3.4.23. Non-recurring operating income (expenses)
 Non-recurring operating income and expenses are recorded if a major event occurs during the reporting period that could distort the interpretation of the entity’s performance. Non-recurring items are limited, unusual and/or irregular items of a material amount and are detailed in Note 5 8


-----

###### 3.4.24. Operating profit (loss)
 Operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, irrespective of whether they are of a recurring nature or whether they result from one-off decisions or transactions.

 3.4.25. Cost of net debt
 The cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings, less financial income from cash investments.

 3.4.26. Earnings (loss) per share
 Earnings (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) attributable to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period (excluding treasury shares).

 3.4.27. Segment reporting
 The Group is not concerned by IFRS 8 – Operating Segments. Revenue is broken down by business in Note 5.1.

###### 4.1.3. Assumptions used in the 2018 impairment tests

 Impairment tests were conducted based on the financial statements at 30 November 2018, since figures for 31 December 2018 were not yet available at that date. 
 The assumptions used in the tests and the method applied are described below. 
 Calculation of the carrying amount of the CGUs at 30 November 2018 
 Estimating the carrying amount of each CGU includes determining the value of the assets that may be directly attributed or reasonably allocated to the CGU and that will generate cash flows included in the calculation of value in use. 
 Goodwill of €1,094 million arising on the acquisition by Partners Group of a controlling interest in Foncia Holding in September 2016 was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used in connection with the purchase price accounting. The goodwill allocation resulted in the following:

###### Regarding intangible assets identified within the scope of the purchase price accounting, the allocation is as follows: 

 • Property Management France CGU: €354.7 million to the Foncia trademark and €354.1 million to client relationships; 
 • Property Management International CGU: €20.7 million to the Domicim and Brolliet trademarks and €7.6 million to client relationships; 
 • Services CGU: €50.7 million to the Foncia trademark and €55.1 million to client relationships.

###### The holding company’s residual economic assets following the asset allocation shown above were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU to reflect the cost allocation of the holding company used to draw up the business plans.
 Calculation of the recoverable amount of the CGUs at 30 November 2018
 In accordance with the Group’s impairment testing approach (see Note 3.4.7), and in the absence of observable fair values in an organised market, the recoverable amount of CGUs corresponds to their value in use, which is defined as the sum of their net cash flows based on the latest forecasts for each CGU, determined using:

 ▪ a business plan prepared by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performance, forecast changes in the economic environment, and expected market trends;
 ▪ a terminal value calculated by capitalising normative cash flows obtained by extrapolating cash flows from the final year of the business plan, with a stable growth rate or a growth rate increasing steadily over the long term;
 ▪ expected cash flows discounted at a rate determined by reference to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
 The forecasts used in the impairment tests carried out at 30 November 2018 are taken from the consolidated “Low Case” business plans prepared by management in March 2018 covering a specified period of three years. These business plans were validated by the Board in March 2018 and presented to the Statutory Auditors in June of that year. The forecasts used were extrapolated through to 2022, to ensure that revenue, depreciation and amortisation approached normative levels.
 It should be noted that all holding company expenses not allocated in the consolidated business plan were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU. Corporate functions are managed at individual country-level for the Property Management International CGU and are considered not material for the Services CGU. 
 The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated based on a sample of six comparable European companies. A WACC was estimated for each foreign country based on their tax rates and the yield on their sovereign bonds. A WACC was then calculated for the entire Foncia Group based on a weighting of each country’s contribution to total EBITDA. On this basis, a single weighted discount rate of 7.4% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs. 

**Country** **WACC** **2018 EBITDA** **WACC contribution**

France 7.4% 96.8% 7.2%

Sw itzerland 7.1% 0.6% 0.0%

Germany 7.2% 1.1% 0.1%

Belgium 7.2% 1.5% 0.1%

**WACC used** 7.4%

###### The activities of the Services CGU are closely linked to the activities of the Property Management France CGU and the Group therefore considers that these two CGUs are exposed to a comparable level of risk. 
 A long-term growth rate of 1.8% was used for the tests. This rate was estimated using information provided by public databases such as the IMF and EIU (Economic Intelligence Unit).

##### Results of impairment tests

###### The strategic plan used for the tests forecasts a rise in cash flow from operations and hence a significant increase in the terminal value included within value in use. 

|Country WACC 2018 EBITDA WACC contribution France 7.4% 96.8% 7.2% Sw itzerland 7.1% 0.6% 0.0% Germany 7.2% 1.1% 0.1% Belgium 7.2% 1.5% 0.1%|WACC|2018 EBITDA|WACC contribution|

###### The table below presents the values in use obtained for the three CGUs, compared with the carrying amounts of their respective economic assets. 

 €m Value in use Carrying amount  Difference Margin (%) Group CGUs 2,574.4 1,873.9 700.5 37.4% Property Management France CGU 1,809 1,344 464 35% Property Management International CGU 123 60 64 107% Services CGU 642 470 173 37%
 As the value in use of each CGU exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment needed to be recognised against the Group’s assets at 30 November 2018. The value of the assets to be tested for impairment at 31 December 2018 is €27 million higher than the value tested at 30 November 2018. In light of this, the results of the earlier impairment test are still relevant and no impairment needs to be booked at 31 December 2018.
 Sensitivity analyses and break-even points
 As recommended by IFRS, the results of these impairment tests were verified by determining sensitivity to changes in certain inputs:

 ▪ +/- 1% change in the long-term growth rate used in the business plan;
 ▪ +/- 1% change in the discount rate (WACC); 
 ▪ normative EBITDA growth rate. 
 The sensitivity analyses show no specific risk of impairment for the CGUs.

###### Trademarks 

 At the date on which Foncia Management acquired a controlling interest in Foncia Holding (September 2016), the Foncia Group and Domicim trademarks were recognised at an amount of €414.2 million based on their valuations. The Group also estimated the value of the Brolliet trademark at CHF €13.7 million (i.e., €12.1 million at 31 December 2018). 
 Concessions, patents and software 

 Concessions, patents and software include the systems measured within the scope of Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting at €16.2 million. Investments in the period amounting to €2.7 million mainly concern Foncia Groupe for €1.6 million. 

 Other changes amounting to €17 million chiefly concern the capitalisation of intangible assets in progress for €13.8 million, along with a €2.4 million adjustment to amortisation charged against software included in Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting. 
 Business goodwill/client relationships 

 At the time of Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting, the fair value of the Foncia Group’s client relationships was estimated at €460.8 million, breaking down between the Group’s three CGUs as follows: (i) Property Management France (excluding the Transactions business): €396.2 million, (ii) Property Management International (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium): €2.2 million, and (iii) Services: €62.5m.

 Following the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Brolliet group in September 2016, client relationships were valued at CHF 7.5 million (€6.6 million at 31 December 2018).

 Investments totalling €5.6 million primarily relate to acquisitions of business goodwill over the period. 

 Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €7 million reflect Primonial’s contribution of its entire stand-alone division as part of the business combination with Leemo (see Note 2.3 of “Highlights of the period”). 
 Other intangible assets 

 Other intangible assets essentially comprise the cost of acquiring new business. The €3.8 million increase in this item in the period reflects the capitalisation of the costs of acquiring new mandates, rebilled to other firms in the network.

###### Fixtures and fittings 

 Fixtures and fittings mainly relate to investments made in the branch network. The €4.7 million increase in the year relates mainly to work on the Métropole project in Toulon (€0.4 million), new branch openings in Marseille (€0.3 million) and Montpellier (€0.3 million), the relocation of Assurimo to its new premises in Lyon (€0.2 million), and miscellaneous work carried out in the branches. Other changes concern the commissioning of fittings work for the Foncia Groupe staff canteen (€1.2 million). 
 Machinery and equipment 

 Changes in machinery and equipment result mainly from the replacement of IT equipment within Foncia Groupe for €4.1 million, and from depreciation charged against this equipment amounting to €2.2 million for the period. 
 Property, plant and equipment in progress 

 Other changes relate to the commissioning of fittings work.

###### In early December 2018, a change in financial lessor on vehicle leases led to the early derecognition of 144 vehicles out of the 987 restated in France. This transfer will continue until the end of first-half 2019. Since these leases do not meet the IAS 17 measurement criteria (sum of future lease payments over three years less than 90% of the residual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term), they are not carried within assets on the statement of financial position.

###### Consolidated investments classified as available-for-sale securities mainly comprise shares in property management companies that will be included in the scope of consolidation. These recent acquisitions were made at fair value. There were no changes in fair value up to the end of the reporting period.
 Other long-term investments mainly include shares in the real estate investment trust Cap’ Hebergimmo, along with historic shareholdings in Swiss property companies and cooperatives. The Group sold some of its Swiss holdings during the period for a price of €1 million. Proceeds from the sale are shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows under proceeds from disposals of non-current assets. As these investments were carried at amortised cost in accordance with IAS 39, the €685,000 disposal gain was recognized in equity pursuant to the first-time application of IFRS 9. 
 Deposits and guarantees paid reflect the net value of guarantee deposits on leases amounting to €5.2 million and deposits paid to guarantee funds (SOCAF, FNAIM, GALLIAN) for €1.6 million. 
 Other long-term receivables mainly include housing loans discounted over a 20-year period totalling €5.3 million, along with advances paid to owners in connection with pre-letting renovation work on their properties for €3.2 million.

 Deferred tax on remeasurement adjustments chiefly concerns the deferred tax arising on Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting.

###### At 31 December 2018, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of tax loss carryforwards chiefly concern tax consolidation arrangements (€6.9 million), tax losses reported by companies in the tax consolidation group (€1.9 million) and Efficity (€2.8 million). 
 The impact of the first-time application of IFRS 15 is an adjustment to the equity of the companies concerned totalling €31.1 million. However, this impact was deducted for tax purposes through an off-book deduction of the same amount (the amount had already been subject to tax in 2017). In the consolidated financial statements, the tax saving resulting from the first-time application of IFRS 15 was allocated to total equity in accordance with the simplified retrospective approach. 
 Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €4 million on other adjustments concern deferred taxes arising on the neutralisation of business goodwill existing before the companies concerned were consolidated.

###### Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position include cash at bank and short-term deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months. These short-term deposits are highly liquid, readily convertible into a known amount of cash, and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
 Cash investments are shown at their market value at the end of the reporting period, with any changes in value recorded in financial income and expenses. The increase in cash investments reflects the consolidation of companies acquired.
 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is chiefly attributable to the large number of acquisitions carried out in the period.

###### On 3 August 2018, the Group repaid ahead of term its ICA loan in an amount of €77 million (see Note 2.5 of “Highlights of the period”). This repayment was financed by subscribing to a new €80 million tranche (“B4”) of its senior facility. The issuance fees for the new tranche amount to €1.2 million and will be recognised over the term of the facility by an adjustment to financial expenses at the effective interest rate as calculated at 3 August 2018 (3.68%).

 The initial accounting treatment was discontinued, with all related unamortised expenses allocated to the ICA loan (€4 million) charged to profit or loss under “Cost of net debt” (see Note 5.9). 
 Since 15 March 2018, the Group has continuously drawn on its revolving credit facility as part-financing for its external growth investments (acquisitions). The Group also draws on its €30 million authorised overdraft facility when necessary. 
 Liabilities relating to the put option granted to Trévi non-controlling shareholders (on 8% of the shares) and to the non-controlling shareholders of the Initiatives group and partners (on 55% of the shares) were remeasured based on actual 2018 figures against equity. Following the acquisition of an additional 25% stake in Somhome in March 2018, the €0.6 million liability relating to the put option granted to non-controlling interests was reversed against total equity. 

 4.11.2. Maturity of borrowings and debt

###### At 31 December 2018, the actuarial estimate of provisions for retirement benefits and long-service awards was based on the report drawn up by Mercer, the firm mandated to estimate the post-employment benefit obligations for the entire Group. 
 The decrease in provisions for retirement benefits and long-service awards in France is a result of the new IPM wage agreements that came into force. 
 The decrease in the Group’s benefit obligation in Switzerland during the period mainly corresponds to the €2.5 million in past service costs (around 27% of the net benefit obligation at 1 January 2018), following the pooling of employees’ supplemental health, life and disability insurance plans into a single fund as opposed to many different collective funds as was previously the case.

###### The amount shown for the past service cost also follows a subsequent decision taken by the Board of the fund to reduce the pension conversion rate in order to ensure its long-term viability. This decision automatically reduces the long-term obligation, since pensions gradually decrease for the same level of paid-in contributions. 
 The net decrease in obligations recognised in other comprehensive income in an amount of €1.7 million primarily results from the significant fall in headcount since 1 January 2018 (departure of 71 employees), and from the increase in the discount rate used from 0.7% to 0.9% (see below). 
 Calculation assumptions used 
 Actuarial calculations are based on a number of long-term assumptions which are reviewed on an annual basis.

###### The provision for risks on client accounts is designed to cover the non-collection risk on lost client accounts in debit, as well as other risks on client accounts. The provision covers 80% of these client accounts. Following a detailed analysis of IPM client accounts, a net provision of €0.7 million was booked at 31 December 2018. IPM provisions accounted for almost half of provisions for risks on client accounts. 
 Provisions for other disputes concerned 71 disputes at 31 December 2018. The decrease in provisions for other disputes is chiefly attributable to writebacks of provisions for disputes booked by Foncia Groupe.

###### Provisions for occupancy guarantees are calculated on a statistical basis. This enables the Group to determine the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The maximum term of claims is 180 days. 
 The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent.
 Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated).
 Provisions for labour disputes concerned 108 lawsuits compared to 117 lawsuits at 31 December 2017. Out of the 108 lawsuits, 32 relate to amounts in excess of €100,000. In all, the claims represent approximately €10 million. The resolution of labour disputes in the period resulted in expenses of €1.1 million and a writeback of €1.9 million from the provision.

###### Employee-related payables include amounts due in respect of paid leave (€29.4 million), amounts due to social security bodies (€27.7 million), variable pay components (€9.6 million), and bonuses and discretionary profit-sharing (€9 million). Earn-out liabilities represented €6.3 million at 31 December 2018. The negative €6.8 million IFRS 15 impact concerns fees and commission in the Transactions business in an amount of €5.8 million, and letting fees for €1 million. 
 The “State” line relates to VAT liabilities totalling €29.7 million and to miscellaneous levies on wages for €7.5 million.
 The significant increase in deferred revenue results from the change in revenue recognition for Assurimo following the first-time application of IFRS 15. Revenue is now recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, whereas up to 2017, revenue had typically been recognised as and when the insurance premium bills were sent out (mostly at the end of the year).

###### At 31 December 2018, client accounts and “Article 55” transaction accounts, recorded under assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position, amounted to €557.9 million.
 France’s ALUR Law requires the use of separate accounts for jointly owned properties comprising more than 15 main lots as from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, Foncia decided not to present separate accounts for its joint ownership association management activities in its statement of financial position. 
 The statement of financial position does not include any amount for Germany or Belgium, which only use separate accounts.

###### In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, which set out the rules for measuring and recognising financial instruments, instruments with a positive fair value are recognised in assets and those with a negative fair value are recognised in liabilities. Fair values of financial instruments are provided by the financial institutions with which the transactions are carried out.

 4.17.1. Interest rate derivatives 
 Further to its refinancing on 7 September 2016, the Group entered into an interest rate cap agreement on 7 December 2016 under the terms and conditions set out below: 

 • Notional amount: €527.9 million 
 • Floating rate hedged: 3-month Euribor 
 • Hedged rate: maximum rate of 1% 
 • Hedging period: 7 December 2016 to 6 December 2019
 On 19 October 2017, the Group also entered into an additional deferred interest rate cap agreement under the following terms and conditions: 

 • Notional amount: €400 million 
 • Floating rate hedged: 3-month Euribor 
 • Hedged rate: maximum rate of 1.5% 
 • Hedging period: 7 December 2019 to 6 December 2020 
 The premiums paid in respect of these cap agreements totalled €915,000.

 4.17.2. Foreign exchange derivatives
 To hedge some of the foreign exchange risk on the loan granted to its subsidiary Foncia Suisse, the Group had entered into hedging contracts through to end-December 2019. Further to the amendment to the loan agreement acknowledging the absence of any repayment date and the adoption of net investment hedge accounting as from 29 June 2018, the Group unwound all of its hedging positions.
 This transaction, which had no impact on profit or loss, led to a cash inflow of €787,000, recorded in the consolidated statement of cash flows under other cash flows from (used in) financing activities.
 At 31 December 2018, the Group no longer had any financial instruments hedging its foreign exchange risk.

###### In 2018, the Property management business in France represents almost 60% of the Group’s total revenue. In all, 89.7% of the Group’s business is generated in France. 
 The significant growth in revenue between 2017 and 2018 reflects: 

 (i) the impact of acquisitions carried out in 2018 for an amount of €36.6 million;  (ii) an increase of some €6.3 million in organic growth;  (iii) an adverse currency effect in Switzerland, with the average EUR/CHF exchange rate increasing from 1.08 to
 1.15 in 2018.

 Other operating income
 Other operating income is primarily composed of gains on client accounts, property rentals re-invoiced to third parties, and retrocessions of fees for the Assurance Privilège product in Assurimo’s comprehensive homeowner’s insurance portfolio.

###### The 1-bp decrease in the margin following the repricing in 2017 (0.75 bps lower at end-March and 0.25 bps lower on 20 December 2017) accounts for the €2.2 million decrease in interest on senior facility B. Lower interest costs on borrowings are linked to the partial early repayment made on 3 August 2018. 
 Drawdowns made on the rollover credit facility since 15 March 2018 lead to much higher interest than in 2017. These interest expenses are partly offset by a decrease in commission on undrawn amounts. 
 Issuance fees for the syndicated loan totalling €30.1 million at 31 December 2018 are recognised over the term of the loan by adjusting the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability to the financial liability’s carrying amount.

###### It should be recalled that following the acquisition of Foncia Holding by Foncia Management on 7 September 2016, a new tax group was formed, effective as of 1 January 2017. The new group opted for a tax loss carry-forward system along the lines of the former tax consolidation group, but with a broader scope. 
 In 2018, the tax consolidation group benefited from an off-book deduction of €29.9 million in respect of the IFRS 15 impact, recognised in equity in the individual financial statements. This amount had already been subject to tax in 2017. Based on the allocation by the holding company of deductible financial expenses and the deduction of the share of acquisition fees of Foncia Holding securities in an amount of €5.4 million, an additional tax loss of €5.6 million was generated in 2018.
 Within the tax consolidation group, tax loss carry-forwards at 31 December 2018 are as follows:

 • Loss arising on tax consolidation: €23.8 million (after a tax loss of €5.6 million generated in respect of 2018). This tax loss has been recognised in full in view of the high probability that sufficient future taxable profit will exist against which it can be utilised. 

 • Proprietary tax losses of consolidated companies: €25.4 million, of which €18.6 million were not recognised, mainly relating to Foncia Holding (€8.9 million), IDHA (€4.8 million) and Foncia Développement (€2.8 million).


-----

###### It should be recalled that in 2017, the Group was eligible for relief in respect of the CVAE in the amount of €7 million, further to a claim filed (QPC). Excluding this relief, the CVAE expense for 2017 amounted to €5.1 million. Besides this impact, the €3.8 million increase versus 2017 is notably due to the sustained pace of the Group’s acquisition-led growth.

 NOTE 8. FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE

 8.1.1. Interest rate risk
 The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises mainly on its borrowings. These borrowings are denominated solely in euros and are managed on a centralised basis. They are mainly indexed to 3-month Euribor. The risk management policy is set by management. 
 Cash flow surpluses and working capital requirements for the Group’s companies are centralised under a cash pooling agreement and managed by the Group’s Treasury department. 
 The Group’s Treasury department selects investment vehicles for cash surpluses – either for proprietary cash or client cash (excluding separate accounts) – within the framework set by the management policy, which prioritises liquidity and security. Interest received is indexed to 3-month Euribor or is at fixed rates (term accounts).
 At 31 December 2018, interest rate risks can be broken down by management outlook as follows, taking into account interest rate maturities applied to the asset/liability financing position:

 Credit risk € thousands Client accounts 557,899
 - Term accounts (client funds) (176,027) + Net cash and cash equivalents 3,268 Assets 385,140

 - Credit line (1,513,760) + Interest rate cap 527,850
 - CICE (15,962) Liabilities (1,001,872)

 Net position (616,732)

 A sudden 1% increase in short-term interest rates applied to the net position of assets and liabilities affected by interest rate fluctuations at the end of the reporting period would result in a rise of €6,167,000 in financial expenses.

 In 2018, the Group still has hedges in place for its credit facilities with an underlying valued at €527,850,000. The cap in place fixes the maximum 3-month Euribor rate at 1%.

|Credit risk € thousands|Col2|

-----

###### 8.1.2. Foreign exchange risk
 The Group is exposed to two types of foreign exchange risk:

   - A foreign exchange risk on assets resulting from the Foncia Group’s shareholdings in its Swiss subsidiaries.
###### Although this risk is measured, it is not subject to specific risk management as the investments are intended to be held over the long term. 

 At 31 December 2018, the Group’s foreign currency positions were as follows:

 CHF thousands Assets 327,831 Liabilities 212,001 Net position before hedging 115,830 Forex hedging 0 Net position after hedging 115,830 Currency value 0.8854 Net position after hedging (equivalent value in € thousands) 102,556

 Accordingly, the Group’s foreign exchange risk exposure on assets is not material. 

   - A foreign exchange trading risk arising on commercial and financial transactions carried out by the Group’s
###### companies in currencies other than their local currency. 

 This risk arises solely on the business of Swiss subsidiaries and concerns the Swiss franc. Since the vast majority of local transactions are carried out in Swiss francs, this risk is not material. 
 It should be noted that currency options had been set up through to December 2019 to guarantee the CHF/EUR exchange rate with respect to the loans granted by Foncia Groupe to its subsidiary Foncia Suisse. On 29 June 2018, Foncia Groupe unwound its entire CHF 13.7 million forex hedge, generating proceeds of €787,000. 
 Foncia in fact signed an amendment to the loan agreement between Foncia Groupe and Foncia Suisse on 29 June 2018, eliminating all repayment clauses. Given that no repayments have been made and that no repayment plan has been set for the foreseeable future, this loan is considered as a monetary item and as part of the net investment in Foncia Suisse as quasi-equity, in accordance with IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. As from this date, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the loan will be taken to other comprehensive income under translation reserves.
