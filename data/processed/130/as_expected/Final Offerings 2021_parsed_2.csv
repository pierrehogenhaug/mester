Unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”).

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the reports of the statutory auditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the Audited Financial Statements. A free English language translation of their audit reports thereon is included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

On January 1, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16. We applied IFRS 16 using the cumulative catch up approach, and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of application, while comparative financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 has not been restated and instead apply IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, which were the equivalent predecessor accounting standard in effect at that time. IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and requiring the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short term leases and leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 exclude €36.0 million and €40.2 million, respectively, of rent costs not incurred as operating expenses as a result of the application of IFRS 16.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. For more information about how we define these non-IFRS measures, see “Summary—Summary Historical _Financial Information and Other Data—Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary Other Financial and Operating Data—Other financial data.” Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our_ performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently and, consequently, our presentation may not be readily comparable to other companies’ figures.

In this Offering Memorandum: “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA before asset disposal, completed acquisition, minority interest and COVID-19 impacts. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue for the relevant period. “Adjusted Revenue” means revenue as adjusted for asset disposals, completed acquisitions, minority interests and COVID-19 revenue impacts for the relevant periods. “current capital expenditures” means the funds used to buy, maintain, or improve our fixed assets, including on information technology, branches refurbishments, excluding the expenditures used in connection with acquisitions. “cost of net debt” is calculated as the cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings, less financial income from cash investments. ----- “EBITDA” is defined as net profit before net loss from discontinued operations, Income tax expense, share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies, other financial income and expenses, net income from cash and cash equivalents, cost of gross debt, non-recurring operating income (expenses) and elimination of net additions to depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets. “EBITDA Margin” is calculated as EBITDA divided by revenue for the relevant period. “Operating Cash Flow” refers Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA adjusted for provisions, change in net working capital, change in CICE (a tax credit for employment and competitiveness created in 2013 in France) and current capital expenditures. “Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA” is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for the pre-IFRS-16 impact on leases at our French and international premises. “Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate” is calculated as Operating Cash Flow divided by Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA for the relevant period. “Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin” is calculated as EBITDA pre-IFRS-16 divided by revenue for the relevant period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, for pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin, total revenue was adjusted for asset disposals. “Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for the expected EBITDA impact of closed acquisitions in 2021, acquisitions with signed share purchase agreement expected to close in the first half of 2021, acquisitions under exclusivity expected to close in the first half of 2021, additional synergies from acquisitions (from 12 to 18 months), capped transfer fee since June 1, 2020 and Agency of the Future / Millenium cost and efficiency gains for the relevant periods. “Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA divided by Pro Forma M&A Adjusted Revenue for the relevant period. “Pro Forma M&A Adjusted Revenue” means Adjusted Revenue as adjusted for the expected revenue impact of closed acquisitions in 2021, acquisitions with signed share purchase agreement expected to close in the first half of 2021, acquisitions under exclusivity expected to close in the first half of 2021, additional synergies from acquisitions (from 12 to 18 months), capped transfer fee since June 1, 2020 and Agency of the Future / Millenium cost and efficiency gains for the relevant periods. “Recurring operating profit (loss)” includes all income and expenses directly related to our businesses, with the exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses).” Recurring operating profit (loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes all items included in operating profit (loss), restated for any non-recurring items.

We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding the real estate industry are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data, statistics and other information are inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such data, statistics and other information are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of data and statistics for different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data and statistics. Market data are inherently forward-looking and subject to uncertainty, and do not necessarily reflect actual market conditions.

We assist our residential and commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with competitive and comprehensive service offerings. Our RRES business is the leader in France, operating under the Foncia brand through a unique network of over 500 branches. We also hold leading positions in Switzerland and Germany and have a strong presence in Belgium and Luxembourg in which we operate under various brands through a network of over 100 branches. We have expanded our size and reach through bolt-on acquisitions and completed over 220 acquisitions since 2016. In addition to our successful M&A track record, our recent performance has been marked by achievements in operations, digitization, and our IT and communications infrastructure. We believe our success is the result of a unique integrated ecosystem of real estate services, which provides the opportunity for organic growth via cross-selling of additional services with recurring revenues and external growth through bolt-on acquisitions. We operate an integrated business model across a wide range of real estate services and divide our real estate services into the following businesses: - **Residential Real Estate Services (representing 60% of 2020 revenue) consisting of - **Joint Property Management (representing 30% of 2020 revenue) through which we are mandated by landlords to manage jointly owned building areas and equipment. - **Lease Management and Renting (representing 30% of 2020 revenue) through which we manage properties on behalf of landlords and assist landlords and tenants throughout their rental process. - **Real Estate Brokerage (representing 13% of 2020 revenue) through which we assist property owners and buyers throughout the real estate sales process. - **Ancillary Services (representing 6% of 2020 revenue) through which we provide services that are complementary to our RRES and Brokerage businesses, including insurance and inventories services. - **Digital Services (representing 4% of 2020 revenue) through which we operate services relying on digital platforms such as online real estate valuation and brokerage. - **B2B Services (representing 4% of 2020 revenue) through which we provide real estate services to our commercial and institutional customers, as well as adjacent real estate services such as insurance and diagnostics. - **International Services (representing 13% of 2020 revenue) through which we provide the full spectrum of real estate services through our international operations in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Sector leadership focused on strongest economies in Western Europe providing competitive advantages,"We have established ourselves as a leader for residential real estate services in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg by delivering high quality, reliable and innovative services uniquely suited to the needs of our customers. As of August 2019, we were the number one player in the French real estate services market, with approximately 13% market share, according to an international report provider. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we managed approximately 1.8 million dwellings in France, which is approximately two times the number of dwellings managed by our next closest competitor according to publically available information for the year ended 2020. Outside of France, we hold leading positions in Switzerland and Germany and have a strong presence in Belgium and Luxembourg. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we operated over 100 branches in these countries, which collectively accounted for 13% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our scale, operations and service offerings provide us with a clear competitive advantage. Our centralized processes result in lower internal costs and enable improved customer service compared to our typically small, individual-owned competitors. Our comprehensive range of innovative services, such as FONCIA 24/7 (our assistance service for our joint property management customers), Prowen (our centralized energy service that reduces client costs on gas and electricity), and Assurimo, (our real estate insurance service), differentiate us from competitors. Our comprehensive network of over 500 branches covering all major French cities is one of the largest offerings in the market and results in close proximity to our customers and the dwellings that we manage; unique market positioning in negotiations with third-party repair and maintenance service suppliers resulting in decreased costs; and financial resources that allow us to expand our customer portfolio through acquisitions. We have been able to successfully enter markets through acquisitions and expanded our operating geography, despite the regulatory and technological requirements that create barriers to participation in the real estate services market. Our regional and national regulatory and real estate industry expertise and our leadership team’s extensive experience in the real estate services industry are key to meeting and complying with such requirements. Our strong reputation for quality and service and multi-branded strategy have also supported our ability to grow in existing markets and enter new markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,Loyal and diverse customer base and synergetic business model in a resilient market,"Our large and diversified client base, integrated ecosystem of residential real estate services and high customer retention rates drive a high level of recurring revenues (75% in the year ended December 31, 2020). We have grown our diversified customer base to approximately 1.5 million dwellings in our French Joint Property Management business and over 330,000 dwellings in our French Lease Management business as at December 31, 2020. Through our synergetic business model, we are able to cross sell our services to our diverse customer portfolio across our business lines, which in turn leads to further organic growth. For example, our proven ability to cross-sell is highlighted by the high penetration rates of Assurimo, our specialized property insurance brokerage unit (providing property insurance, homeowners’ insurance policies and brokerage services) through which we currently provide insurance services to 61% of our French Joint Property Management buildings. Similarly, we currently provide technical services to approximately 88% of our Lease Management customers through our dedicated business, Constatimmo. We believe that we are well positioned to target new customers, including B2B customers, given our knowledge regarding fulfilling requirements for our B2C customers. The addressable markets in which we operate are characterized by high outsourcing rates, with a high and stable portion of joint property or condominium owners (85% in France) under external management, as of August 2019 using services like our Joint Property Management business. Property owners tend to rely on expert services such as ours due to the volume of work and amount of legal and accounting know-how required to directly interface with tenants and other counterparties. Moreover, landlords rarely switch leasing managers during a tenancy, given the risks and costs involved in switching service providers and the limited potential benefit. We believe that through the integrated ecosystem of high-quality services we consistently provide we have established high customer retention rates, and long lasting customer relationships, certain of which last more than 20 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we lost only 3.5% and 8.4% of customers from our Joint Property Management and Lease Management businesses, respectively. Moreover, 36% of our customers from our Joint Property Management business in France entered into contracts of three or more years and 24% for two to three years for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to our broad and diverse customer base, we are not reliant on any particular customer. ----- According to an international report provider, the French property management market is estimated to be €12.2 billion in August 2019, of which €5.3 billion is captured by property management companies, with the rest serviced in-house. The externally serviced property management market has grown by approximately 2% annually between 2014 and 2019. This stable growth has been driven by population dynamics and the construction of collective units.

Our trend of improving EBITDA conversion rates has continued with a Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate, of approximately 76% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 71% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Despite our regular M&A activity, our discretionary spend on acquisitions provides us with flexibility to manage our cash flow and reduce our financial leverage. In addition, from 2016 to 2019, we reduced our total net leverage by approximately 0.6x on average per year. Further, our business requires limited maintenance capital expenditures, (accounting for approximately 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020), and is characterized by limited working capital requirements. Our revenue increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 up from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our margin resilience is supported by an adaptable cost structure for the more cyclical flow Brokerage business, as Brokerage salary costs include a significant variable portion that is indexed on commissions. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 26.9%, 26.8% and 22.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our recurring, stable revenue is in part due to our complementary business profiles across our branches, experienced management and sales force teams, and fee-based services in connection with our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses which accounted for 69% of our revenue in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, our high proportion of recurring revenues (75% in 2020) and balanced portfolio of services split between stock and flow businesses with limited correlation have supported our resilience during adverse economic conditions, achieving a substantially stable performance in 2020 despite unprecedented government measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,Continuous investments in operational improvement through our innovative technology platforms reinforces our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains,"We continuously invest in cutting edge technology in order to offer the best multi-channel services to our customers. Since 2017, we have upgraded a significant portion of our IT and communication infrastructure including utilizing a mix of integrated and outsourced solutions, transitioning to a single telecom provider, and streamlining our finance and human resources functions with Workday, which enabled us to quickly and effectively transition to a work-from-home environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also leveraged our technological know-how combined with our knowledge of the real estate industry to design and launch a go-live version of our new ERP system, Millenium, which we have piloted at one of our branches in France in 2020. Millenium integrates all of our IT and resource planning functions into one database to better meet our customers’ needs and address internal business challenges. Millenium increases the digitization of our activities with the aim of helping customers by creating greater transparency and improving our operations with standardized, digital processes to increase efficiency and to improve the speed at which we can serve our customers. We believe our high levels of investment in IT for our corporate platform and customer interface service such as over recent years give us a competitive edge in the current environment. The digitization, standardization and automation offered by Millenium complement our already synergetic business model and will allow us to more quickly leverage our customer database to identify cross-selling opportunities leading to greater operating efficiencies and inter-business synergies. We believe that Millenium’s compatibility with big data, AI and IoT, will allow us to explore new business opportunities and provide access to a number of revenue-enhancing opportunities. For example, we are developing a new operational model called “Agency of the Future” which will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real estate services and aims at improving client satisfaction and reducing our customer churn rate, which we believe will, in turn, lead to greater opportunities for organic growth. In addition, we believe that the gains of Millenium and the development of Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in 2022. We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technology to continually improve our internal ----- operations in order to provide our customers with product offerings that meet their needs and make us the number one choice among residential real estate service providers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

We completed 220 acquisitions from January 2016 to December 2020, which represented approximately €386.0 million of acquired revenues (including gross revenues for Leemo netted for commissions to agents in our financial accounts). In the year ended December 31, 2020, we made 61 acquisitions in our primary French market and in other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management dwellings and approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings and approximately €111.0 million of acquired revenues. We completed 61 acquisitions which contributed to our Adjusted EBITDA that reached €286.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consolidation is a natural trend in the highly fragmented markets we operate in, accelerated by increasing regulations, and we play a key role in the market by defining new quality standards and unrivalled execution processes. We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is dedicated to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our five geographical regions. Our long-standing integration experience, including a dedicated post-acquisition integration team, enables us to extract full synergy potential from acquired businesses, with both cross-selling and cost synergies.

Our management team comes from various industries and geographies and is supported by five heads of region, who have extensive experience in real estate and enable us to provide our customers with tailored expertise and service. We believe that the collective industry knowledge and leadership of our management team positions them well to continue our successful organic and external growth and execute our strategies. Further, our management team encourages growth through a focus on operational efficiency and innovation including through the management’s dynamic external growth policy that enabled us to, among others, establish our market leading presence in Germany, successfully divest our non-core businesses to focus on our core, synergetic businesses and more recently, by the ongoing overhaul of our IT infrastructure, including the development of Millenium and enabling our planned transition to our new operational model, “Agency of the Future.” This is demonstrated by the consistent increase in our revenues which increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (€1,013 million excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic) up from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Our most recent digital innovation, Millenium, an in-house developed ERP system that is device-agnostic, cloud-based and driven by artificial intelligence, will allow us to fully digitalize all of our businesses and establish a highly personalized digital relationship with our customers. We believe that Millenium will also allow us to better, more efficiently serve our customers, cross-sell across our platforms and therefore capture greater market share from existing customers and generate business from new customers. Our IT and data platforms are subject to a process of continuous improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investments, such as the team of over 80 developers and specialized professional we hired to create Millenium. We believe that our robust investments in our IT and data platforms provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses have been required to transition to a work-from-home environment. Additionally, our ongoing and historical use of big data, AI and IoT to create new business opportunities enables us to maintain a cutting edge development ----- program while minimizing the risks traditionally associated with experimentation. For example, we are in the process of developing our new operational model, Agency of the Future, which we believe will generate significant savings, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain tasks that were previously done manually, such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges. Since 2018, we have invested approximately €100 million into our IT projects, and we believe that the gains of Millenium and Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in 2022. We have developed, and continue to develop, innovative solutions based on emerging trends that are aimed at providing our customers with the highest quality, optimal solutions for their real estate needs.

We intend to continue to benefit from this growth through expanding our service offerings by introducing new business lines. In addition, we aim to reduce our customer churn rate further by improving client satisfaction, including as a result of the overhaul of our IT systems. In addition, we have made, and intend to continue to make, bolt-on acquisitions in our core French market and the other geographies in which we operate to supplement our organic growth, solidify our current market position and expand our presence. We have a strong track record of successfully identifying, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions. From January 2016 to December 2020, we completed approximately 220 acquisitions. We believe that our strong brand, broad platform and our dynamic infrastructure have allowed us to generate growth and operating cash flows through acquisitions. Recent examples of targeted acquisitions in France that have accelerated our growth and have allowed us to better address customer needs include Gérance de Passy and LoftOne, in our RRES business, Yxime and Perial in B2B and in the German B2B segment, Paul Immobilien and SogerTec. We intend to continue to further strengthen our strong position in the market by pursuing opportunistic acquisitions in our existing geographies to accelerate our growth, and we aim to do so by leveraging our internal expertise.

We intend to leverage our expertise and know-how as well as our highly localized real estate providers to penetrate European markets where there is an unmet demand and an opportunity for further expansion, as evidenced by factors such as population dynamics and the construction of collective units, accompanied by increases in price and service level and a higher degree of outsourcing driven by regulatory changes. We strategically pursue new markets while remaining committed to expanding in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg as these markets offer us proximity to existing customers and expansion opportunities in countries where we have established brand recognition. We also plan to enter European markets, where we believe local markets have strong fundamentals, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Scandinavian countries, Austria and various other Eastern European countries where we aim to become the market leader.

130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Recent Developments,9.6.1,Current Trading,"Based on our management accounts, we estimate that for the month ended January 31, 2021 compared to the month ended January 31, 2020, our revenue increased by approximately 7.3%, from approximately €74.7 million for the month ended January 31, 2020 to approximately €80.2 million for the month ended January 31, 2021. We estimate that our reported EBITDA for the month ended January 31, 2021 increased by approximately 7.8% from approximately €17.1 million for the month ended January 31, 2020 to approximately €18.5 million for the month ended January 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, we estimate that we had cash and cash equivalents of €63.8 million. While our operations have remained resilient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and we are fully operational across all business areas, we expect some carry-over impact notably as a result of the November 2020 lockdown in France during which fewer property transactions took place, which will be reflected in our first quarter 2021 financial statements, in line with the customary three month lag between signing of brokerage transactions and revenue recognition upon closing. This impact is expected to primarily affect the results of our Joint Property Management (mainly on our additional fees) and Brokerage businesses. _Joint Property Management_ In the one month ended January 31, 2021, we estimate that our Joint Property Management business revenues increased by 7% compared to the one month ended January 31, 2020 to €25.3 million. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors _Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.” Brokerage Business_ In the one month ended January 31, 2021, we estimate that our Brokerage business revenues decreased by 3% compared to the one month ended January 31, 2020 to €9.9 million. This decrease was primarily related to the November 2020 lockdown in France and due to property viewings being limited as fewer customers purchased, rented or sold properties. We expect that the impact of the November 2020 lockdown will be reflected in our 2021 financial statements because we recognize revenue in our Brokerage business up to three months following the signing of a transaction. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.” The information presented above relating to our performance for the one month ended January 31, 2021 is derived from internal management accounts.

The Post-Closing Collateral includes, among other security, pledges over the shares of the Pledged Opcos. The Pledged Opcos do not provide a guarantee and the share pledge over such Pledged Opco does not constitute a debt obligation of the Pledged Opcos but rather a security interest in the shares of such entities and, upon enforcement, creditors could take control of the Pledged Opcos and sell the property and assets of such Pledged Opcos to satisfy their direct obligations and their indirect claims.

(b) Data for 2018 has not been restated to reflect the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16. We began applying IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information. Under this approach, a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. However, following additional analyses carried out in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 15 (related to revenue from contracts with customers), in the year ended December 31, 2019, we changed our accounting presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to the reclassification of the contracts to be classified as contracts where we act as agent, as opposed to contracts where we act as principal, as was previously the case, and the statement of profit and loss figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been restated accordingly and net profit (loss) from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests was adjusted to correct a minor presentation error.

We define Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the IFRS-16 impact on leases at our French and international premises and includes IAS 17 adjustments for leasing for vehicles, copy machines and laptops, and also reflects the impact of certain asset disposals for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. As a result, we experienced an increase in EBITDA of €40.2 million and €36.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to rent costs no longer being incurred as operating expenses. Our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 is already presented on a pre-IFRS-16 basis. We present Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA as additional information because we believe it is helpful to investors in facilitating comparability of our results across the periods presented and evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However, Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. (2) Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin and EBITDA Margin is calculated as Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA and EBITDA, respectively, divided by revenue for the relevant period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, for pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin, total revenue was adjusted for asset disposals. (3) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures. We define EBITDA as net profit before net loss from discontinued operations, Income tax expense, share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies, other financial income and expenses, net income from cash and cash equivalents, cost of gross debt, non-recurring operating income (expenses) and elimination of net additions to depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before asset disposal, completed acquisition, minority interest and COVID-19 impacts. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as additional information because we believe they are helpful to investors in highlighting trends and evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However, other companies may present EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and therefore comparability may be limited. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net profit as an indicator of our operating performance, profitability, liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

(b) Represents the estimated pro forma impact of closed acquisitions during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the target for the next 12 months, without double counting the results already included in the relevant period, based on its historical data. The number reflects the estimated impact of the churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model, which are calculated based on the historical churn and cost savings we have achieved with prior acquisitions. These figures are diligenced in connection with each acquisition and validated by our operational and regional teams who will integrate the target as part of their perimeter and track the performance against budgeted figures. Most of the acquisitions are integrated within three to six months and are then part of the organic perimeter of the Group. The types of synergies that are recognized in the first year following an acquisition, many of which are recognized on day one, typically include target management costs if they do not stay with the business, staff costs related to functions such as headquarters and accounting, advertising costs, non-recurring items such as recruitments fees and subcontracting, and accounting adjustments such as for taxes and leases, which we record below EBITDA.

(d) Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns. While our Joint Property Management and Lease Management businesses have been relatively resilient as our employees were able to service customers from a remote working environment; they did experience a slight fall in revenues due to impacts such as a reduction in transfer fees in Joint Property Management and disruptions with the postal service, which led to delays in sending invoices and receiving fees in Lease Management. We also experienced some offsetting effects such as government programs to supplement salaries for employees who were unable to work as well as a decrease in headquarter costs and performance bonuses. The following table presents the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EBITDA across our businesses for the year ended December 31, 2020. For purposes of determining our Adjusted EBITDA, we have only included the €20.8 million estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our recurring stock business lines as those are generally more stable and predictable. In addition, we also estimate that we experienced a €10.3 million impact on our Brokerage and Letting business lines, which are primarily non-recurring flow businesses. We calculated the adjustments by assessing our actual performance against our budgeted metrics for these business lines based on historic performance, while taking into account offsetting effects such as government programs and cost savings, as well as identifiable impacts unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Our Brokerage business line was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first lockdown from March to May 2020. During this time, we were not able to recognize revenue due to the cessation of notary services, and the closure of our agencies and the limited ability for people to move led to a reduction in new transactions. As a result of the restrictions imposed during the second lockdown in France lasting approximately two months from October 30, 2020 (the “second lockdown”), the number of new transactions was impacted, but not as significantly, and notaries were allowed to work, which enabled us to recognize revenue during this period. The renting side of our Lease Management and Renting business is a transaction-based business that also experienced a decline in revenue when the French government largely prohibited people from moving to new properties during the initial lockdown and, to a lesser extent, during the second lockdown. Constatimmo, which performs diagnostic and inventory reviews, experienced a similar decrease in revenue as a result of fewer lettings and therefore fewer individuals requiring its services. For a more detailed description of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including the breakdown of lost revenue by business line, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors affecting _results of operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_ The above information and adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. This information has not been audited, reviewed or verified by our statutory auditors in accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards and the resulting financial information, including our Adjusted EBITDA, are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. In particular, the adjustments take into account our estimated lost revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic based on our internal budgets and historic performance. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA _Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_ (4) Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. We define Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA after giving pro forma effect to the estimated impact of closed acquisitions in 2021, acquisitions with signed share purchase agreement expected to close in the first half of 2021, acquisitions under exclusivity expected to close in the first half of 2021, additional synergies from acquisitions (up to 18 months), capped transfer fees since June 1, 2020 and Agency of the Future / Millenium cost savings and efficiency gains. We present Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA as additional information because we believe it is helpful to investors in highlighting trends and evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However, other companies may present Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and therefore comparability may be limited. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as nonrecurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net profit as an indicator of our operating performance, profitability, liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. ----- The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA for the period to Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA for the period presented:",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the target for the full year based on its historical data and includes the impact of estimated churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to each acquired company’s integration in our operational model, which are calculated based on the historical churn and cost savings we have achieved with prior acquisitions. These figures are diligenced in connection with each acquisition and validated by our operational and regional teams who integrate the target as part of their perimeter and track their performance against budgeted figures. Most of the acquisitions are integrated within three to six months and are then part of the organic perimeter of the Group. The types of cost synergies that are recognized in the first year following an acquisition, many of which are recognized on day one, typically include target management costs if they do not stay with the business, staff costs related to functions such as headquarters and accounting, advertising costs, non-recurring items such as recruitment fees and subcontracting and accounting adjustments such as taxes and leases, which we record below EBITDA. (b) Represents the pro forma impact of potential acquisitions where we have signed share purchase agreements and expect to close in the first half of 2021, as if such acquisitions had closed at the beginning of the period. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the acquisition for the full year based on its historical data and includes the impact of the estimated churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model. These figures are calculated on the same basis as described in footnote (3)(a) above. (c) Represents the pro forma impact of potential acquisitions that we have under exclusivity arrangements and expect to close in the first half of 2021, as if such acquisitions had closed at the beginning of the period. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the acquisition for the full year based on its historical data and includes the impact of the estimated churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model. These figures are calculated on the same basis as described in footnote (3)(a) above. Based on our M&A track record since 2016, we have a 95% success rate for closing an acquisition when we have a transaction under an exclusivity arrangement. However, there can be no guarantee that the same rate will materialize with respect to future acquisitions. For purposes of determining our Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, we have only included €7.1 million out of the €12.9 million estimated impact from the total number of acquisitions under exclusivity which are expected to close in the first half of 2021. (d) Represents additional further synergies and churn from acquisitions in the 12 to 18 months after the closing date, in addition to those already considered in pro forma EBITDA figures in the first 12 months. These synergies include cost synergies related to employee costs, rents, Millenium gains and other costs such as accounting, insurance, IT maintenance and legal costs, travel expenses and bank fees and revenue synergies related to, for example, insurance implementation, the GLI guarantee and crossselling opportunities between our different divisions. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us relating to each individual acquisition and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates. (e) Since June 1, 2020, transfer fees have been capped by the French government at €317 (excluding VAT) per transaction by the French government. We estimate this will decrease the average transfer fee by €80, which results in a yearly impact of a loss of €4.8 million on a full-year basis based on an estimated 60,000 transfer fee transactions. In order to offset this €4.8 million impact, we have set up initiatives to increase the penetration rate of DSP (“Pré Etat Daté”) services in our Joint Property Management business, which we estimate had a positive full-year impact of €2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which results in an overall impact of €2.1 million for the year. The adjustment of €875 thousand corresponds to the estimated negative impact of the decrease in transfer fees and gains from subsequent initiatives in first five months of 2020. (f) Represents the estimated gains from efficiencies from the Agency of the Future project by 2022, following the deployment of our new ERP system, Millenium. We are designing a new organizational model named Agency of the Future, which will be implemented following the roll-out of Millenium in 2022. As a result, we estimate gains, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees, an increase in productivity and reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitalization and automation of certain tasks previously done manually (such as collection of reminder fees or postal charges). We have quantified the impact of the plan by (i) identifying potential for productivity improvement, such as analyzing time spent by employees for their principal tasks in a select number of agencies and identifying potential for improved processes after implementing these projects, (ii) reinvesting and improving service quality by, for example, defining a goal for the joint property management and lease management business and the principal tasks of managers and assistants and quantifying the reinvestment necessary in specific roles in order to put this target organization in place and (iii) scaling of the network resulting from the options for improvement of processes and required reinvestment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures in connection with Millenium and Agency of the Future were €17 million. We anticipate capital expenditures of €19 million in the year ended ----- December 31, 2021 for the development and the deployment of Millenium. By the end of 2022, we estimate approximately €15 million in gains as a result of efficiencies due to Millenium and Agency of the Future, with approximately €20 million nonrecurring costs related to those gains. We believe that, we will experience additional gains in the following years, as a result of these projects. For more information, see “Business—Digital Transformation and IT Systems.” The above information and adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. This information has not been audited. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve for operational efficiency successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected. For more information see, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our _Business and Industry—Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve for operational efficiency successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.”_ (i) In evaluating Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, as an analytical tool, it is subject to certain limitations. In particular, run-rate cost savings and synergies are unaudited and based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forward looking in nature. We may not be able to achieve these cost savings and synergies in a timely manner or at all. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, including a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates of cost savings and synergies. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the periods presented and may not be comparable with our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these items proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our cost-saving measures. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated at the beginning of the period. The EBITDA of each of the relevant acquired companies may not be representative of what the EBITDA of such entities would have been for the period, as the case may be, had the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated at the beginning of the period.

In addition, any of these events may have a direct impact on our ability to collect payments that we are owed under our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de _loyers impayés”) and occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”), which we offer to certain residential_ landlords and lessors, respectively. See “—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or _tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_ Our results of operations are significantly impacted by economic trends, government policies and the real estate markets in the countries in which we operate. These include the following: overall economic activity, changes in interest rates, the impact of tax and regulatory policies, the cost and availability of credit and the geopolitical environment. The performance of our RRES services depends on our ability to collect fixed fees, charge variable fees for ancillary services, find tenants to bill transaction fees and collect rents. Our Joint Property Management business model is composed of fixed fees and variable fees related to additional services that could decline due to adverse economic conditions or administrative restrictions such as pandemic lockdowns. Additionally, the revenue derived from the Lease Management side of our Lease Management and Renting business is generally based on a percentage of rent collections from the properties we manage and, with respect to the renting side of the Lease Management and Renting business, from the one-off fees we receive for each new lease agreement entered into by our customers. The revenue generated by our business can be affected by many factors, including: (i) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions; (ii) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and regionally; and (iii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns. If tenants are unable to pay their rents, we are unable to collect the fees that are typically directly deducted from these rental payments. Adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also impact our Brokerage business as it may lead to a decline in property sales and/or a reduction in sales prices, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in brokering such transactions. Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty, as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets, business environment and the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our future financial performance. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Macroeconomic and market conditions.”_ Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the UK entered into a transition period which terminated on December 31, 2020, before which on December 24, 2020, the UK and the European Union agreed to a trade deal (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”) which was ratified by the UK on December 30, 2020 and is still subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the UK and the European Union could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on consumer behavior. Brexit has created political ----- uncertainty within the European Union, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth in certain jurisdictions. It is possible that other members of the European monetary union could hold similar referendums regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future. Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response thereto; the effect on our customers, our customer’s financial position and customer and tenant demand for, and ability to pay for, our services; our ability to provide our services, including the impact of travel restrictions and staff working from home; and any closures of our offices and facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic had several significant effects on our business, including decreased demand for our services as a result of the slowdown in the European economies in which we operate and our inability to offer certain services as a result of government lockdown measures. In accordance with the decisions taken by most European governments in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public during the lockdown period in France, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, from approximately mid-March to mid-May 2020 (the “first lockdown”), as well as to employees (barring exceptional cases). During that period, real estate agents were barred from traveling to sign mandates or show properties and notaries were closed, which prevented any brokerage transactions from closing. For further discussion on notary execution, see “Regulation—France—Hoguet.” Moving into new premises during this period was particularly complicated, as only moves that could not be postponed could be carried out, which resulted in reduced letting fees for the period. The first lockdown measures imposed on the French, Swiss, German and Belgian population also negatively impacted our fee collection with an increasing number of residential and commercial tenants not being able to pay their rent on time or at all, although the rents remained owed as a matter of law. The lease management market was also affected as we collect a portion of rents via check, and there were disruptions with postal service, which led to delays in sending and receiving invoices and fees. For further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our various businesses, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors _Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_ The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions, and thus the disruption caused by these factors could further impact some or all of our business divisions. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and there is a significant risk of recurring outbreaks in affected countries, and possible future mutations in the virus may prove difficult to contain. For example, many countries in Europe have reintroduced full or partial lockdowns in late 2020 in order to stem subsequent waves of higher infection rates. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or further lockdown measures could also adversely impact our ability to deliver our services. We anticipate some continuing impact on our EBITDA and revenue at least through the first half of 2021, but the impact may be longer lasting and we can offer no assurances as to when or if such impact will end. Any of these events could cause or exacerbate the risks and uncertainties described herein and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"We have numerous local, regional and national competitors across all of our businesses and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation, fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future competition.","We compete across a variety of businesses within the residential and commercial property services industry, including management of jointly owned properties, rental management and lettings, property transaction intermediation, specialized property insurance brokerage, technical due diligence and inventories and consulting services for commercial and office properties, business-specific IT services, marketing of properties by blocks or lots and technical maintenance. Although we are Europe’s leading providers of residential real estate services, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies and businesses. Depending on the geography, property type or business, we face competition from other residential or commercial real estate services providers and investment firms, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms and consulting ----- firms. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or business than we have allocated to that geography, property type or business. In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors or further consolidation of the industry. For example, increased regulation following the implementation of the 2014 French access to housing and urban renovation law, l’accès au logement et un urbanisme rénové (“ALUR law”), and the increasing need to invest in the digitization of services has led to the increased consolidation of a highly fragmented market. For further discussion on the ALUR law, see “Regulation—France—ALUR.” Reaching critical scale is important for the digitization and industrialization of processes in order to reduce costs and improve customer service. Our industry is highly fragmented among regional, local and boutique providers. Although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger or have a stronger presence on a local or regional basis or in their primary markets. We are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar services to our commercial real estate business, and it is possible that further consolidation in the residential and commercial real estate industry could lead to much larger competitors in the geographies, property types and businesses that we serve. In addition, disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to effectively compete. Further, we also face competition from service providers, who may have greater knowledge of their home markets, a better understanding of the specificities of regulations and local legislation and established reputations in their region. There is no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete, maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Moreover, our customers’ tenants could experience a change in their financial situation at any time, including as a result of global economic events, natural disasters and public health or pandemic crises. Our customers’ tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases, or expiration of existing leases without renewal, and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated or expired leases. Although a significant portion of our revenues are derived from “stock” businesses consisting of providing fee-based services to our customer portfolio, the loss of income by our customers could hinder their ability to pay such fees. Moreover, while our fees for our Joint Property Management business are expected to be paid by the landlords whether or not the property is being rented or occupied by the landlord, for our Lease Management and Renting business, our fees are paid only if the properties are being rented and paid for by the tenants. Therefore, lease terminations may result in a decrease in fees that we receive. Additionally, even if the lease continues, but the tenant fails to pay rent, we will not be able to collect our fees because they are automatically deducted from rental payments. We also are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in the winter so the effect of non-payment may be greater during that time because we will not be able to evict and re-let the property as quickly as during other times in the year. See “Regulation.” In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights and may incur substantial costs in protecting our customers and re-letting their property. If commercial leases are terminated or defaulted upon, it may be difficult to find a tenant to whom the property can be re-let. We also offer a rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés”) to certain residential landlords who have entrusted us with the management of their property. Under this guarantee, we bear the cost of any unpaid rent and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and thus represent a risk of non-recovery. We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”) to a small number of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected apartments in new buildings. As a result, we may bear the cost of any unoccupied properties under this guarantee. For example, the quantity of unpaid rent typically increases during the winter months when we are prohibited from evicting people under French law, and thus it is possible that we may experience an increase in loss of revenues if we are unable to rent such properties. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, our stock increased temporarily as it built up when we were unable to process disputes and evictions as a result of the first lockdown restrictions. In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant increase in unpaid rent or defaults, however, we cannot ensure that our revenues will not be negatively impacted as a result of future lockdowns or other COVID-19-related disruptions. ----- There is no assurance that we will receive payments that we are owed under our rent payment and occupancy guarantees; therefore, both represent a large source of potential risk. Moreover, the occurrence of any of the situations described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets, and in the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed 61 acquisitions. We plan to continue to expand our business externally through similar acquisitions depending in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient funds from our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, existing debt facilities and additional indebtedness to fund these acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we pursue largely depends on the quality of the potential target and a key point of focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary reason we decline to pursue a target after entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of the target’s client accounting. The success of our acquisition strategy depends on the ability of our senior management to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of such acquisition candidates, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals from regulatory bodies and to integrate the operations of such businesses once they are acquired. Our success in making additional acquisitions depends on the availability of, and competition for, suitable acquisition candidates. Further, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including any misjudgment of the key elements of an acquisition, quality of client accounting, competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, lack of internal resources to actively pursue all attractive opportunities and availability of capital. Even after entering into a share purchase agreement, exclusivity agreement or letter of intent, there can be no assurance that such acquisition will close until such transactions are finalized, which may also impact the Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present information _relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_ When we do identify and complete acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention and resources needed for existing operations, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, acquiring businesses that are not consistent with our long-term strategies, integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, potential dilution of our brand, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities. We have historically financed acquisitions through a variety of sources, including our own cash reserves and debt financing. While we intend to continue to finance acquisitions from these sources in the future, we may have insufficient cash reserves to fund acquisitions, and adverse market conditions or other factors may prevent us from obtaining debt finance on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy, obtain sufficient financing or integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business and prospects for growth could be negatively affected. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and disposals.”_ ----- Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful implementation of our acquisition strategies. Additionally, our strategies may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment or this may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future acquisitions or we may face unforeseen costs or liabilities. In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and bolt-on acquisitions, and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. Our ability to realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisition activities, including any anticipated sales growth, cost synergies and other anticipated benefits, will depend in large part upon whether we are able to integrate such businesses efficiently and effectively. Integration is an ongoing process, and we may not be able to fully integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. Successful integration of acquired businesses will also depend on our ability to effect any required changes in operations or personnel and may require capital expenditures or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. The integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including the following: liability related to the mishandling of customer cash accounts; difficulty in integrating the acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, including the full integration of the acquired business account management into our IT system, management information and financial control systems; unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions; significant unexpected liabilities or contingencies arising from the acquisitions; potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by our senior management’s focus on the acquired companies; and post-acquisition performance not meeting our expectations or plans. We are required to have separate customer accounts in our Joint Property Management business, and if a target has poor customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances or complying with applicable law. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions will be made on appropriate terms or at an acceptable cost or can be successfully integrated with the rest of our businesses. A failure to identify appropriate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies of past or future acquisitions could result in the lack of implementation and achievement of our growth strategy may prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both landlords and tenants in residential real estate lease transactions or our Brokerage business could have inside information about a property or the property owner’s circumstances relative to other brokers as a result of our managing that property through our RRES business. In certain cases, we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our customers. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to monitor, address and limit actual or perceived conflicts, such as an officer in charge of our risk management team, anti-bribery software, a whistleblower hotline and data compliance procedures, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate or may not be adhered to by our employees. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing customers or fail to gain new customers if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions, regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets.

It may be difficult for us or our agents (including real estate brokers and subcontractors hired by other third parties we engage) to regularly inspect such properties and manage the maintenance and upkeep on behalf of our customers and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may find it difficult to manage tenants if they encounter difficulties with the properties they rent. For example, although there are certain basic necessities that must function properly, such as heat or water, we cannot force a landlord to comply with all tenant requests if they are not mandated by law. Therefore, a tenant may have an unfavorable view of us as property manager for unresolved requests that the landlord will not approve or if they are unhappy with the quality of work commissioned by the landlord, which can present a risk to our reputation. The occurrence of any such development could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to perform the property management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, engaging the appropriate subcontractors, maintaining sufficient personnel and retaining key personnel at the number of our properties that we manage under our Lease Management and Renting and Joint Property Management businesses. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, in integrating any new personnel into our organization or in engaging with the appropriate subcontractors at reasonable costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality and maintain other necessary internal controls.

The estimates contained herein are our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. Our ability to realize the expected cost savings, gains and synergies associated with the adjustments included when calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other non–IFRS financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or industry conditions. We may be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies, and these costs are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies will not be higher than we anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings, gains and synergies within 12 months of the completion of the respective acquisitions, and may not do so at all. Further, our churn rate in respect of the bolt-on acquisitions may be higher than expected. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment in our Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings or gains. Our ability to realize these anticipated gains and synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. In addition, any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take.

Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including the personal conduct of individuals associated with our brand, the handling of customer complaints, regulatory compliance, such as compliance with anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, the use and protection of customer and other sensitive information, and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand. Our portfolio of brands and our reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside of our control.

As a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial and residential real estate services, we, and our licensed professionals and independent contractors, are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations.

These consumer organizations representing tenants are able to organize class actions in the real estate services market, which has been introduced by the French Hamon law, and file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. For example, we are currently involved in claims against us for alleged losses brought on behalf of lessees related to over charges for receiving notices to pay. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” We could be subject to claims following the acquisition of a business or subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities or regulatory agencies if they determine that we are violating licensing laws or failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations. In our residential property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide services for our managed properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our customers may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the customer relationship. We engage with subcontractors to provide a large number of building staff in facilities that we manage, and as a result, we face the risk of potential claims from such staff, such subcontractors. ----- We also face employment-related claims as an employer with respect to our corporate and other employees, for which we would bear ultimate responsibility in the event of an adverse outcome in such matters. We also face claims related to our franchisees, with respect to the termination of our franchise agreements and other claims which may arise related to such agreements. Adverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes and related or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage procured and maintained by us. Further, we face the risk of claims of illness or injury relating to premise liability given that we lease, manage and sell properties to our customers. Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance policies we maintain. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims held under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies.

With respect to cyberattacks and viruses, these pose growing threats to many companies, and we may be a target of such threats, which could expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm to our business and financial results. In addition, the operation and maintenance of our systems and networks is, in some cases, dependent on third-party technologies, systems and services providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property or disruption of our ability to provide services to or interact with our customers, contractors and vendors, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We could also face difficulties in bringing the IT systems of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our standard security procedures and protections, which could lead to interruptions or failures of our information systems. ----- Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers, our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our business relies heavily on the use of software and residential real estate data, some of which is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. A disruption of our ability to access such software, including an inability to renew such licenses on the same or similar terms, or provide data to our professionals and/or our customers, contractors and vendors or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our in-house employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software, phishing and spear phishing attacks, wire fraud and payment diversion, account and email takeover attacks, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks, including attacks that are not ultimately successful, could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of our data, and could also substantially damage our reputation. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including ransomware attacks by cybercriminals, and we expect we may experience additional attacks in the future. Cybersecurity attacks like the ones we have experienced in the past could have a substantial impact on our reputation with our customers, and stakeholders, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations that could cause us to be unable to provide our services or operate our business, which could damage our reputation. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches and other cybersecurity attacks and may incur significant additional costs to address issues caused by any such breaches or cybersecurity attacks. Our failure to prevent future security breaches or cybersecurity attacks, or wellpublicized security breaches affecting the internet in general, could significantly harm our reputation and business and financial results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Certain laws may also require us to protect the security of our employees’ personal data. In particular, we are subject to the stringent requirements of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), violation of which carries substantial fines and grants individual ----- data subjects the right to claim damages for rights violations. In addition, in connection with the processing of personal data, we are also subject to French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties as amended, which incorporates the provisions of the GDPR. A public authority, the French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l’informatique et des Libertés) (“CNIL”), is responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in France. We cannot ensure that the confidentiality of such data and information will not be breached as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, or that doubts may not arise regarding the security of the data and information collected and managed by us. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws, regulations and standards can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. If customer confidential information or personal data that we maintain is inappropriately disclosed due to an information security breach, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our confidentiality policies or other controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may incur substantial liabilities to our customers and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by governmental authorities. Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification claims with our customers and other parties and harm our reputation. In addition, any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality agreements with our customers may result in termination of their engagements, resulting in associated loss of revenue and increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.

We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have developed internally or acquired, such as Millenium, or mobile apps developed as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former in-house employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld. Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights if we are not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.

Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. We may not be covered by insurance in specific instances, such as fire, explosions, natural disasters, water damage and terror attacks. While we seek to maintain ----- appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable, and we may experience major incidents of a nature not covered by insurance. Furthermore, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.","We are subject to numerous European, national and local laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our businesses. Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of valuation services requires us, and our employees, to maintain applicable licenses in certain countries in which we perform these services. If we, and our employees, fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations regarding our licenses, we may be required to pay fines or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended, cancelled or revoked. In addition, the residential real estate industry and residential tenancies in particular remain heavily regulated and closely monitored by consumer watchdog organizations and associations that can organize class actions and file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. The latest major change came in 2014, with the introduction of the ALUR law, under which the French government introduced, among others, measures to protect individuals considering buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. A large amount of extra documentation is now required before the pre-contract (compromis de vente) can be signed, which increases the time between the initial offer and closing. We must comply with law No. 89-462 dated July 6, 1989, which grants residential tenants a statutory right of renewal and caps rents for vacant units and renewed leases at the amount of the last indexed rent paid by the previous tenant and/or of a reference rent determined by the decree. This law also restricts a limited number of landlords a right to recover service charges from tenants and requires residential leases to complete various reports on the environmental status of the property or technical features of the premises. In addition, we are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in winter, from November 1 to March 31 each year. In 2021, this period was extended in 2021 until May 31 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must also comply with articles L.145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, recently modified by law No. 2014-626 dated June 18, 2014 known as the Pinel Law, for premises leased to commercial tenants. The French commercial leases regime establishes various compulsory obligations establishing, amongst others, a minimum term of nine years, a tenant’s statutory right of renewal on lease expiry, a cap on renewed rents and a limitation on service charge recoverable from tenants. We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental, employment laws, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, and occupational health and safety regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters. As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past decade, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future. New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or customers. For example, on May 25, 2018, GDPR became effective with a greater territorial reach than existing laws, and it applies to all of our contracts and agreements throughout Europe. As a result, we updated and continue to update certain agreements and data protection practices, which may take significant time and cost. We are unable to predict how new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. Our tax returns and the tax treatment of our transactions are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties, and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief, withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, European, Luxembourg and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. In this respect, an increase in administrative efforts within our business and an impact on existing structures may occur from the current incorporation into French and Luxembourg tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit-shifting (“BEPS”) that were included in the final reports released by the OECD and the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017. The European Union intends to harmonize tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions) from January 1, 2020. Among the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules apply from January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to _Each Series of Notes—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on these rules._ Furthermore, Article 108 of the 2019 French Finance Law introduced, under French tax law, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax and aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement or a series of arrangements which are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, having been put into place for the main purpose, or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law. While the ATAD was implemented into Luxembourg domestic law by the law of December 21, 2018 and entered into force on January 1, 2019, the ATAD 2 was implemented into Luxembourg domestic law by the law of December 20, 2019 and entered into force on January 1, 2020, save for the reverse hybrid mismatch rule, which will enter into force on January 1, 2022. ----- The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016 including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It is expected to be implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and consolidation being put in place swiftly afterwards. In this respect, the European Commission has published its work program for 2020, which indicates that the CCCTB should receive priority attention this year. Furthermore, additional rules on tax dispute resolution apply since January 1, 2019 following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the 2019 French Finance Law. These regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Group’s companies are located, or operate, or may be located, or may operate, may not always provide clear-cut or definitive guidelines, the tax regime applied to the Group’s operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations (past or future) is or may sometimes be based on the Issuer’s interpretations of French, Luxembourg, or foreign tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities.

In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business and IT personnel in particular. We and our competitors use equity incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize senior management. As competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase, and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past.

Labor laws applicable to our business in certain countries, particularly France, are relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition, some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to ----- respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business. Although we believe our relations with employees are good, our operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work-slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our employees in certain countries benefit from collective bargaining agreements, and we may not be able to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms.

Certain IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB. Notably, the effectiveness of IFRS 16 (Leases) from January 1, 2019 has an impact on the manner in which we carry out our financial reporting. The application of IFRS 16 has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our reported assets, liabilities and income statement as we will recognize new assets and liabilities for our operating leases. We chose to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative information, which means that our data for the year ended December 31, 2019 cannot be meaningfully compared with data for the year ended December 31, 2018. Under this approach, a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date.

Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the New Senior Credit Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has indicated through a series of announcements that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will continue to be supported going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted., Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the New Senior Credit Facilities.

The pledges over financial securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a financial securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured creditor, either by a sale of the pledged financial securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution _judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire) of the financial_ securities to the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged financial securities. In a proceeding for attribution judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an expert is appointed (whether contractually or by the court) to value the collateral (in this case, the pledged financial securities), and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the financial securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire or an _attribution conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the_ foreclosed financial securities.

The Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, ----- whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged, because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.

Such debt includes the guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, and the obligations under the New Senior Credit Facilities. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the Senior Notes Guarantees. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Senior Notes Guarantees. Until the senior ranking debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled, but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement, shall instead be made to holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Senior Notes Guarantees. In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Notes Guarantees will provide: - customary turnover provisions (relating to certain specified amounts) by the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor; - that if a payment default on any senior ranking debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Notes Guarantees until such default is cured or waived; - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking indebtedness that permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default, such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Notes Guarantees, until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and - that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances. The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantors under the Senior Notes Indenture, and by accepting any Senior Note, each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.

In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more of each Issuer’s, the Guarantors or any other of each Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against each Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances, the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such Guarantor; - direct that each Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents (as defined herein) will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations _or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the Guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis and: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) ----- was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to each Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and the enforcement of each such Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Note Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Note Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Note Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes. Accordingly, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Note Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Note Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in relation to, indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that the recipient return the payment or any proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the French Guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or ----- security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-bycase basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the Guarantor or security provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. In addition, each of the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other document governing the Note Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the Note Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover, an increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Note Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes ----- representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuers will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indentures. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream.

The directors and executive officers of the Non-US Obligors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Non-US Obligors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under US securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of Non-US Obligors.

Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the US Supreme Court, actions of the Non-US Obligors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce: (i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Non-US Obligors and the directors and executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness.

Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their own funds over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong.

French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s own funds, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall indebtedness ratio of the group as determined under accounting consolidation rules (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group’s debts (with the exception of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the consolidated group’s own funds) to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its own funds). Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax ----- deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer from any related party) and at the level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 bis, I of the French Tax Code under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 bis, VII of the French Tax Code under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Articles 119 et seq. of the French Tax Code and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code. Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 includes specific provisions which implement into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which would be applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which would be applicable as from January 1, 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes,13.5.24,The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes.,"On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted and implemented by France, should replace the French FTT. Following the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (the “ECOFIN”) meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on FTT. The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019, indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In addition, we have established ourselves as a leader for real estate services in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg by delivering high quality, reliable and innovative products uniquely suited to the needs of our customers. We assist our residential and commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with competitive and comprehensive service offerings. We provide end-to-end assistance, from managing individual apartments and building areas jointly owned by apartment owners through our lease management and joint property management business lines, respectively, to providing renting, brokerage and digital and ancillary services such as insurance brokerage, technical diagnostic, and distribution and energy brokerage offerings through our other business lines. Our RRES business is the leader in France, operating under the Foncia brand through a network of approximately 134 and 131 branches dedicated to our RRES and Brokerage businesses, respectively, and 242 branches dedicated to both our RRES and Brokerage businesses, representing 84% of our revenue in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. We operate an additional 101 branches under various brands in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our French RRES business, Brokerage business, ancillary services, Digital services, B2B services and international business generated 60%, 13%, 6%, 4%, 4% and 13% of our total revenue, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.1,Macroeconomic and market conditions,"Our results of operations, including the demand for rental properties and our Brokerage businesses, the ability of tenants to pay rent and the level of our costs and expenses, are impacted by economic trends and market conditions such as: - changes in interest and inflation rates, unemployment rates and the level of wages; - economic growth or decline; - demographics (population size, growth and composition of a residential property); - consumer confidence in the economy or the residential property market; - local or regional economic conditions in the markets we serve; - local and regional property inventory levels, the cost of land and land use restrictions; - credit market strength and the cost and availability of mortgage financing; ----- - mortgage underwriting standards or down payment requirements; - levels of foreclosure activity in the French, German, Swiss and Belgian markets, home ownership rates and consumer preferences; - political uncertainty or other geopolitical developments, pandemics or natural disasters; - global pandemics or natural disasters disrupting day-to-day operations and activities; and - man-made disasters that disrupt local or regional markets that we serve. These factors combined with the cyclical nature of the residential property market impact supply and demand, which in turn impact, among other things, residential property prices, Brokerage business commissions and the volume of Brokerage transactions. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Macroeconomic and market conditions.”_ We believe the diversified nature of our services between recurring and transaction-based activities, our geographic coverage including nationwide presence in France and certain other geographies and the scale of our business have provided some insulation from economic cycles and resiliency to negative market conditions. We classify our revenues as either “stock” (recurring) or “flow” (transaction-tied). Within each business line, there may be stock and flow components based on the various types of revenue streams. Our stock businesses consist of recurring revenues, which by their nature provide better long-term visibility and are less sensitive to the volume of housing transactions and economic cycles. Stock revenue generation is primarily composed of, in both residential and B2B businesses, our Joint Property Management fixed fee, Lease Management fee, including fees on collected rents and insurance broker fees and fees unique to our business such as our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés” or “rent payment guarantee”) which we offered on 66% of our residential dwellings in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. For more information on our rent payment fees, see “—Rent payment and occupancy guarantees.” Our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses are examples of largely stock businesses producing a high share of recurring revenues. Notwithstanding the stability, stock businesses retain some sensitivity to changing economic or market conditions. For example, higher unemployment rates or potential decreases in wages or salaries may affect the average income of tenants or reduce their ability to pay rent and, if tenants do not make rental payments, we are unable to collect our fees which are taken by automatic deduction from rental payments. In addition, if tenants are unable to pay their rent, this could impact the property owner’s (i.e., our customers) ability to pay certain other fees and this non-payment could obligate us to make payments to the property owner under our rent payment guarantees. Where we have offered our rent payment guarantee, we bear the cost if a tenant fails to make a timely rent payment and these advances are not always recoverable. Our business model, however, aims to balance both stock and flow businesses to mitigate the impact of changing market conditions with a stable mix revenue derived from stock and flow businesses. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 62% of our revenue derived from stock businesses. Flow activities are those for which we charge transactional fees that are not automatically recurring, and are thus more dependent on the external factors listed above. Our Brokerage business is an example of a largely flow business where we only receive a fee upon the closure of a transaction and, therefore, it faces greater exposure to economic fluctuations than our stock businesses. Brokerage fees are limited to our real estate sales transactions. Other examples of flow activities include revenue generation composed of, for example, letting fees, Constatimmo (our technical due diligence and inventories services unit) activities related to brokerage and letting, some Joint Property Management variable fees, such as transfer fees, reminder fees and maintenance and repair commissions on third-party invoices. We generated 87% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 in France. Although we operate nationwide in France and therefore benefit from diversification across a range of real estate services markets, we are particularly sensitive to the economic conditions and developments in France as well as potential regulatory changes, economic shocks, or social upheaval, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The real estate services market, particularly in France, is highly fragmented, providing opportunities to add scale, market presence and revenues by acquiring businesses, ----- centralizing costs and operating as part of our diversified portfolio. These acquisitions have been a driver of the growth in our geographic scale, breadth of offerings, revenue and profit margins. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed 61 acquisitions in both our primary French market and in our other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management dwellings (bringing our total to approximately 330,005) and approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings (bringing our total to approximately 1,463,402) and approximately €111.0 million of acquired revenues. In addition, as part of our overall growth strategy, we proactively manage the composition of our portfolio. We take measures to increase efficiencies and profit and cash flows which include focusing on our RRES business offerings and occasionally disposing of certain assets that are less profitable. For more information on our business lines, see “Business—Overview.” Our results of operations are affected by the number of locations where we provide services and the geographies and market conditions in which those sites are located. As a result, our results for future periods may not be directly comparable to past periods because of the large volume of acquisition activity that we have undertaken.

We bear the cost of any unpaid rent and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. However, due to our diligent selection and recovery processes as described below, we believe these rental guarantees offer an attractive business model and by underwriting these guarantees on our balance sheet, we believe we offer a differentiating and competitive service to customers that smaller players would not be able to deliver. Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts and, while a tenant remains in the property, we account for the related payments as follows: - the rent guarantee related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are deducted from rents in the same way as basic property management fees; and - when a tenant fails to make their rent payment and after they have vacated the property, we record a provision on our balance sheet that is calculated in accordance with IAS 37 to account for the loss. The amount of the provision we set aside increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (“Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires” or “ACL”) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). From a cash flow perspective, we pay rent to the landlord when rent is due, regardless of whether rent is received from the tenant, and will take remedial measures to try to recover the payment from the tenant. Once a tenant leaves the property, we record for the direct loss. We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation” or “occupancy guarantee”) to a small number of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected apartments in new buildings. We typically only offer this occupancy guarantee in limited circumstances for highly desirable properties where we believe there is a low risk of loss. The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days. In December 2020, on average, 66% of our residential dwellings in France were covered by the rent payment guarantee and 12% of residential dwellings were covered by the occupancy guarantee. We believe we have a strong ability to assess credit risk when offering these guarantees and we undertake a detailed process to select eligible tenants and dwellings. We refer to the new, unpaid rents as a result of defaults under a guarantee each month as our new monthly aggregate of unpaid rent and the total sum of unpaid rents per month as our cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent. In December 2020, €124.7 million of rent revenues were covered by the rent payment guarantee, for which we experienced €3.5 million new unpaid rent (compared to a 2020 monthly average of new unpaid rent of €3.3 million) and the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent was €27.7 million, including outstanding rent payments from previous years. ----- The chart below sets out unpaid rents (in EUR millions) for tenants who remained in their flat versus tenants who moved out of their flat from September 2019 to December 2020, under our rent payment guarantee: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent increased temporarily as it built up when we were unable to process disputes and evictions as a result of the initial lockdown restrictions in France, but we did not experience a significant increase in the overall amounts of new unpaid rent or defaults. The cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent also typically increases during the winter, from the first of November to the end of March, when we are prohibited from evicting people under French law. See “Regulation— _France—Eviction Laws and the Winter Truce—Winter Truce.” The below chart reflects this increase of the_ cumulative aggregate amount of unpaid rents (in EUR millions) for tenants who remained in their flat, under our rent payment guarantee, that temporarily increased during the COVID-19 pandemic: We take proactive measures to insulate our business from losses under both the rent payment guarantee and occupancy guarantee including through the stringent credit assessment that we undertake before providing these guarantees and our unpaid rental collection processes. Following an eviction and the transfer of the surrogative discharge from the landlord to us, we have a strong team that seeks to recover the unpaid rent from the defaulting tenant, including by legal means. We have historically recovered approximately 35% of the unpaid rent amount over the last three years, which is added to our statement of profit and loss as revenue. Therefore, given the regulatory regime that restricts when we can evict a tenant and the time it takes to collect unpaid rent, the risk associated with the guarantees has historically been related to the timing of cash flows, rather than lost revenue. However, any unrecoverable payments under these guarantees could result in a significant loss or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Our Business and Industry—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_ -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In order to comply with government-imposed social distancing recommendations, all of our premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public during the initial lockdown (from mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France), as well as to employees, barring exceptional cases. We were most acutely impacted during this initial lockdown. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced direct impacts in the year ended December 31, 2020 on revenue, margins and operating cash flow, particularly related to the Brokerage business and, to a lesser extent, to the Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses, and our other businesses as described below. Moreover, we typically recognize revenue in our Brokerage business up to three months following the closing of a transaction. Therefore, although our Brokerage business experienced an estimated impact from the second lockdown in the year ended December 31, 2020, the full impact is not expected to be reflected in our financial statements until 2021. _Consequences of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_ The general lockdown measures imposed by the governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate effectively froze the property market from the middle of March to May 2020. In order to protect our workforce and maintain the continuity of our operations, we implemented preventative measures including allowing employees to work from home, permitting short-term working arrangements and providing exceptional travel certificates to certain employees to carry out minimum duties. See “—Business continuity plan.” These costs were all accounted as non-recurring operating income (expenses) due to their exceptional nature. Partially due to the success of the measures we have implemented, we believe we have been able to manage our operations and employee absenteeism, with minimal disruption. As the countries in which we operate progress through varying levels of restrictions and until activity resumes to normalized levels, we will continue to be impacted. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict.

We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is dedicated to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our four geographical regions. We are likely to continue to undertake expansion projects in the future to support geographic growth and profitability and improve the breadth and quality of our service offerings. The number of acquisitions we undertake depends on the quality and pricing of potential targets available for purchase at a given time. Additionally, a key point of focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary reason we decline to pursue a target after entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of their customer accounting. By law, we are required to have separate accounts for our Joint Property Management customers and if a target has poor customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances, complying with applicable law or integrating such target’s systems into our own. The price paid for a particular acquisition depends in part on the target entity’s revenues and cost base, along with competition to acquire the business. Our results of operations are therefore impacted by the quality of our due diligence, as well as by our success in integrating any acquired businesses into ours and extracting synergies, gains and cost savings from such acquisitions. Following an acquisition, we integrate the companies into our existing group structure and consolidate all administrative functions, such as payroll, human resources, IT, procurement, sales and marketing, finance and treasury and other support functions, with our central headquarters. Acquisitions we complete may also lead to improved margins and customer retention through, among other measures, the offering of ancillary services to an expanding customer base in a wider geographic network and the leveraging of our scale to procure additional premium partnerships and favorable pricing terms in our utility contracts for our customers. These initiatives have contributed to the successful integration of the acquisitions that we have made and the realization of synergies from such acquisitions. As a result of integrating the acquired business into our existing business, we may also experience an increase in one-off costs such as IT and other integration costs, accounting costs, severance costs, real estate lease agreements termination penalties, potential retention bonuses for key employees, cost related to the rebranding or other expenditures. Therefore our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place may be affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated results from the date of their combination or acquisition. We have a track record of implementing a majority of synergies immediately following the acquisition and are able to quickly realize the impact of the synergies, gains and costs savings from the acquisition. However, it may take up to 18 months to realize our expected costs and efficiency gains for an acquired business.

We are subject to laws and regulations including those related to rental access and urban planning, rents we can charge, data protection, tax reduction schemes for rental property investors and reforms to housing, planning and digital technology. For example, the French government has introduced measures to protect individuals buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. The Access to Housing and Urban Renovation Law (“ALUR”), which was introduced in March 2014, imposed restrictions on the fees agents can charge for selling or letting property and required two dedicated bank accounts for each jointly owned property, thereby resulting in loss of interest income on customer accounts and a large administrative burden. The ALUR law also required a significant amount of extra documentation before the pre-contract (compromis de vente) can be signed, which increased the time between the initial offer and closing and thereby delaying our revenue recognition. In addition, it required publication of commissions when payable by the buyer and any resulting competition from low cost agents. Notwithstanding these requirements, we have experienced certain positive impacts from the imposition of the ALUR law. For example, it required landlords to register their buildings, which became a new fee-based service we began providing. Changes in, and compliance with, such laws and regulations may entail significant costs for us and can have an impact on our results of operations. For a description of certain material regulations applicable to our business, see “Regulation.” Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, whether identified as a result of an investigation or otherwise, could lead to adverse publicity, harm our reputation or divert management time and other resources. In addition, non-compliance could result in disciplinary action, imposition of fines, the revocation of a license or authorization or the need to take remedial action. In particular, the loss of a license or authorization could mean that we are no longer able to carry out the business or activity for which we were previously authorized or licensed and any remedial action that may need to be undertaken could result in a significant cost. Finally, such laws, rules and regulations may subject us to more onerous conduct of business and administrative requirements, limit the types of fees or services we can charge and provide or otherwise alter the current regulatory or tax environment, each of which can have a significant impact on the manner in which we conduct our businesses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our businesses, financial condition, results _of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.

Our principal costs include staff costs and marketing and IT costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, staff costs accounted for 55.9% of revenue. Our business (excluding brokerage activities) has a largely fixed cost base. Our fixed costs, which do not fluctuate with business volumes, consist primarily of salaries and wages (excluding variable commissions, employee profit shares and bonus arrangements), rental costs, most of our information technology (“IT”) costs, as well as other general costs. Our Brokerage business, which is more exposed to real estate services market cycles in which our employees are paid based on commission, operates primarily with variable costs, with approximately 26% of fixed costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Since variable costs tend to fluctuate with business volumes, we will need to react quickly in the future by decreasing such costs if we forecast a potential downturn in business volumes or increase in such costs as the market recovers. The management of our cost base is an important factor impacting our results of operations and cash flow. We are able to initiate cost cutting measures when required, such as using temporary employees and limiting travel, entertainment and office expenses and reducing variable compensation. In addition, our management team sponsors a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce fixed costs. For example, we launched a pilot version of Millenium, our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in March 2020 at one of our branches in France, and we expect for it to be completed at the end of 2021 or early 2022. We have invested significant resources in Millenium including a team of 80 developers and specialized professionals in order to build this innovative and advanced real estate platform. Our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by our ability to successfully implement Millenium and other initiatives to improve our operational performance. We believe that the improved standardization and digitization Millenium offers, will allow us to reduce administrative inefficiencies and achieve greater productivity. In parallel to the deployment of Millenium, we have been designing a new organizational model called Agency of the Future ----- which will be implemented following the roll-out of Millenium. Our vision for Agency of the Future sets out four key goals (i) industrialize tasks with low added value; (ii) distinguish ourselves thanks to our expertise in joint property management and rental management; (iii) have close proximity to our clients; (iv) reinforce our attractiveness for staff. As a result of this new organization model, we expect to generate significant cost and efficiency gains mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain tasks previously done manually (such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges). We believe Millenium and Agency of the Future will enable us to achieve greater organization among our businesses allowing our employees to focus on customer satisfaction with the potential to lead to improved customer retention. In the coming years, we plan to fully digitize all business of our businesses, internal processes and our customer relationship management with Millenium. For the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures in connection with Millenium and Agency of the Future were €17 million. We anticipate capital expenditures of €19 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 for the development and the deployment of Millenium. By the end of 2022, we estimate approximately €15 million in saving and gains as a result of efficiencies due to Millenium and Agency of the Future, with approximately €20 million non-recurring costs related to those gains. We believe that, we will experience additional gains in the following years, as a result of these projects.

The French government largely prohibited people from moving to new properties during the initial lockdown which impacted our ability to generate revenue during that period. Our Lease Management business continued to mostly function normally from an administrative perspective, but disruptions to the postal service did lead to delays in delivering customer invoices and receiving customer checks by mail. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is also a risk, particularly in our commercial Lease Management business, that fees on unpaid rent will be difficult to collect on the scheduled timetable or at all. Commercial customers from our Lease Management business represent 5% of our Lease Management dwellings. Certain of our customers negotiated for, and we agreed to, a rent holiday or reduced rental payments for a fixed period after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite some lost revenue, we believe these negotiations were more advantageous than initiating eviction proceedings and finding a new tenant in this market in the event a customer missed a rental payment. The collection of fees and rent from our residential Lease Management customers was also partially impacted in certain regions such as Marseille as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Brokerage business was virtually at a standstill during the initial lockdown beginning in March 2020 since we do not recognize revenue until after finalizing a transaction and physical visits of properties were not possible during this period. In addition, during this lockdown, real estate agents were not able to travel to sign mandates or make visits, and notaries were closed through May 2020. The cessation of notary services and prohibition on visits in particular resulted in limited production and revenue recognition during this lockdown. During the government lockdowns that followed, notaries were permitted to work and although in-person property viewings for customers remained limited or prohibited, real estate professionals were allowed to show properties via video chat. Therefore, while we were able to close transactions in the second lockdown which took place from October 30 to November 28, 2020, the ongoing lockdown restrictions had some impact on our revenue. Since the French government has determined that notaries can work through lockdown measures, it is unlikely we will experience a period of zero production in the future. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly changing as well as actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, and thus we cannot predict the impact it may have on our business, financial condition and results of our operations. Our Joint Property Management business was relatively resilient with minor impact to revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic because our employees continued operations from a remote working environment in which they were able to successfully service customers. In addition, Joint Property Management business experienced a fall in revenue from incidental fees such as transfer fees since people were not moving as frequently, and fees for additional services. Joint property owners pay these additional fees as commission for a specific service they request for additional works. These fees are typically approved at the general assembly meetings of joint property owners, which were often delayed when in-person meetings were banned as a result of lockdown measures. However, these general assembly meetings are now primarily held online and the incurrence of these incidental fees has resumed. Our other businesses were impacted to varying degrees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Lodgis, our platform for letting furnished apartments, which largely targets temporary residents such as international students and professionals, experienced a large drop in revenue as a result of a significant decrease in the number of expatriate students and professionals moving to the countries in which we operate. For more information on Lodgis, see “Business—Overview.” Revenue for Constatimmo, which prepares diagnostic and inventory reviews before a tenant enters an apartment, is largely linked to the brokerage and renting market cycles so it experienced a similar decrease in revenue as a result of fewer lettings that require such review. For more information on Constatimmo, see “Business—Overview.” Through our Assurimo business, we offer specialized property insurance to joint property owners. The general assemblies of the joint property owners in France are typically key events at which we engage with these customers and market and contract for these insurance products. When lockdown restrictions largely prohibited in-person meetings and many of these events were postponed from March to May 2020, we experienced an initial drop in revenue in this business line, but it rebounded later in the year. Esset, our B2B business which comprises all lines of business with commercial and institutional customers, did not experience a significant ----- impact. However, revenue did decrease initially when we were not able to carry out renovation work in France due to lockdown restrictions in March 2020. Revenue for our Swiss and Belgian businesses experienced similar trends as those in France. Germany was less impacted than the other jurisdictions in which we operate, but also broadly followed analogous trends. Our resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic has been in part due to the initiatives implemented by our leadership team which included utilizing government assistance programs in France and Switzerland to supplement salaries for furloughed employees who were unable to work and implementing cost-saving measures such as reducing the number of contracts dedicated to individual properties and hiring temporary employees. Our business Efficity also received a cash loan with a state guarantee in the amount of €1.4 million for a period of one year. This loan was repaid in December 2020. In addition, unplanned cost-savings benefits were achieved as employee travel costs were eliminated due to travel restrictions imposed by the governments across all countries in which we operate and bonuses, which are linked to employee performance, were lower than budgeted. _The above information and adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. This information has not been audited, reviewed or verified by our statutory auditors in accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards and the resulting financial information, including our Adjusted EBITDA, are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. In particular, the adjustments take into account our estimated lost revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic based on our internal budgets and historic performance. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.

These procedures included: - Work from home for all employees whose work can be performed from home and who had the necessary tools available. - In RRES and our Brokerage businesses, an exceptional travel certificate was granted to managers so that they could carry out minimum duties alongside senior executives. An exceptional, occasional travel certificate subject to restrictions was issued to critical employees dealing, for example, with incoming correspondence, cash inflows and payments and handovers. - For employees facing increasingly difficult working conditions such as lettings negotiators, developers or real estate consultants, short-time working arrangements were put in place. We designed organizational and communication guidelines for businesses in order to optimize our organization during these exceptional circumstances using various procedures. We believe we were able to quickly adapt to the changing circumstances presented by teleworking and the COVID-19 pandemic without significant additional costs as a result of investments in IT and digitalization that we had undertaken in the past. As a precautionary measure, on March 19 and 24, 2020 we drew an aggregate amount of €190 million under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to ensure liquidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but have subsequently repaid such amounts.

In the income statement, this standard application results in an amortization and interest expenses recognition. These changes become effective from January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and high-value equipment, requiring that leases be placed on balance sheet by recognizing a “right-of-use” asset, representing the lessee’s right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability, representing the lessee’s obligation to make lease payments. In the income statement, the application of this standard results in amortization and recognition of interest expense. The changes resulting from IFRS 16 became effective as from January 1, 2019. In accordance with IAS 8, we applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach in the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, with no restatement of comparative information for 2018. As a result, the financial information presented in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 does not give effect to the application of IFRS 16. In 2020, in light of the changes in lease accounting under IFRS 16, we initiated a strategic project aimed at reexamining (and if necessary re-estimating) the terms of lease arrangements. As a result of this change, the duration taken into account for the valuation of leases in France that were to be tacitly renewed was revised to be increased to three years, which can be explained by the imperatives in terms of continuity of the operations, which encourage the continuation of the initial lease, and our strategy based on external growth. _2019 Restatement_ In the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2020, the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2019 and the consolidated income statement and cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 were restated to give effect to application of the definitive decision of the IFRS IC and subsequent position statement of the ANC on determining the lease terms of certain real estate leases. This decision of the IFRS IC included interpretation guidelines for the determination of a lease term, in particular with regard to French commercial leases. ----- It includes a reminder that the lease term that when evaluating the debt associated with the lease is the period for which it is enforceable, a lease no longer being enforceable when the lessee and the lessor each has the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty. It also provides a clarification that in order to determine how long a lease is enforceable and whether a penalty is insignificant under IFRS 16.B34, it is necessary to take into consideration the broader economics of the contract and not just contractual termination payments. The notion of a penalty thus must include any economic incentive to not terminate the contract. In its decision, the IFRS IC also noted the need for consistency between the lease term for a lease for the determination of the debt associated with the lease and the useful life of related non-removable leasehold improvements. Moreover, the French accounting standards setter (the Autorité des Normes Comptables or the “ANC”) published on July 3, 2020 a new position statement related to the determination of the lease terms of commercial leases known as “3-6-9 leases” (known as such because such leases are signed for at least nine years, with unilateral termination possible by the tenant after three or six years). This new position statement replaced a prior position statement dated February 16, 2018. In particular, in this update, the ANC concluded that the lease term should reflect the term for which the tenant is reasonably certain to continue the lease and that, when the legal length of the lease is nine years, this length is “generally nine years at the outset.” In 2020, we initiated a strategic project to re-examine (and, if necessary, re-estimate) the lease terms of our real property leases in light of the decision of the IFRS IC and the updated position statement of the ANC. As a result of the completion of this project, the lease term that was taken into account for the evaluation of real property leases in France that were to be tacitly renewed was revised upward to three years, based on imperatives in terms of continuity of operations, which encourage the continuation of the initial lease, and our particularly active and opportunistic real property strategy for the rationalization of our real property (including in particular as a result of several restructurings due to our external growth). We had previously applied nine months as a lease term in our 2019 financial statements when first applying IFRS 16 at January 1, 2019 (based on the soonest possible surrender date, taking into account a legally required six-month notice period after the end of the first quarter in the calendar year) and six months at December 31, 2019. In accordance with IAS 8, the impacts related to these changes in lease terms and that directly result of the application of the IFRS IC decision have been accounted for using the retrospective method. See note 3.2 to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. We refer to the restatements described above as the “2019 Restatement.” For ease of comparative review, we present financial data reflecting the 2019 Restatement when comparing information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 with information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. _2018 Restatement_ In 2019, following additional analyses carried out in connection with the application of IFRS 15, initially adopted in 2018, we changed our income statement presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to a separate classification of revenue from contracts where we act as agent, as opposed to in aggregate with revenue from contracts where we act as principal as was previously the case. Furthermore, revenue from contracts where we act as agent is now presented net of the cost of fees in accordance with IFRS 15. Since this does not allow a meaningful comparison of consolidated revenue (and the related external charges) between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the statement of profit and loss figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 has been restated accordingly, leading to a negative impact of €14.9 million on revenue as presented and a similar positive impact on “Purchases consumed and external charges.” This change in presentation has no impact on recurring operating profit for 2018. In addition, net profit (loss) from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests was adjusted to correct a minor presentation error. See note 2.7 to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. We refer to the restatements described above as the “2018 Restatement.” For ease of comparative review, we present financial data reflecting the 2018 Restatement when comparing information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Our results include incremental revenues and expenses following the completion date of an acquisition. In addition, there is generally an initial adverse impact on net income from an acquisition as a result of preacquisition due diligence expenditures, transaction/deal costs and post-acquisition integration costs, such as fees from third-party advisors engaged to assist with onboarding and process alignment, retention and severance expense, early lease termination costs, and other integration expenses. We have historically used strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale within existing capabilities and to expand our presence in new or existing geographic regions globally. We believe that strategic acquisitions will increase revenue, provide cost synergies and generate incremental income in the long term. _Recent Developments_ On December 31, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Loft-One, one of the largest property administration companies in the Southwest of France. We paid a temporary purchase price of €27.7 million, and we acquired 14,062 properties in rental management and 38,734 in condominium management. We believe that through this acquisition, we are emerging as the leader in the local market. On December 11, 2020, we completed our acquisition of OP Property Management (Office des Propriétaires), a management property company based in Brussels. We paid a total purchase price of €14.5 million, and we acquired four branches. We believe that this acquisition will further our goal of becoming a leader for real estate services in Belgium. Due to timing of these two acquisitions, we have not consolidated the results into our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. In accordance with IFRS 15, we recognize revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to us, and specific criteria are met by each of our businesses, as further described below. _Joint Property Management business_ From a contractual and legal perspective, our Joint Property Management business is mostly conducted through mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services. All such services are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association. Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis (over time) based on actual amounts billed (costs are in line with the billed amounts). ----- Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and disputes. Transfer Fees are also invoiced directly to a landlord selling its property. Since each additional service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognized when the service is performed. _Lease Management and Renting business_ In the lease management line of our Lease Management and Renting business, we act as agent for ownerslessors and fulfil a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These represent separate service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognized separately. Revenue from services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance is recognized on a percentageof-completion basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue from one-off services is recognized when those services are provided. In our lettings business, revenue is recognized at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted. We collect fees from owners and from lessees. _Brokerage business /Efficity_ Revenue in the transactions business is recognized upon signature of the notarized final sale agreement (acte _authentique), which is the date on which control is presumed to have been transferred. Client accounts_ Interest income generated on client funds, limited to rental cash deposits, is booked in revenue. _Assurimo_ Assurimo provides property insurance brokerage services. Revenue under comprehensive property insurance and comprehensive homeowners’ insurance policies is recognized over the term of the cover, since services in this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis. _Constatimmo_ Constatimmo carries out mandatory technical surveys on premises, as well as inventories of premises for lessees. Its revenue is recognized and measured when the related services are performed. _Seiitra_ Seiitra provides specialist IT property services and developed the Powimo software, which it markets through its software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions model. These property management tools offer the full suite of functionalities needed to keep accounting records for client accounts and to manage suspense accounts, jointly owned properties and rentals, as well as the budget of jointly owned property associations. Maintenance fees are recognized on a straight-line, percentage-of-completion basis, since the corresponding services are provided over time. _Esset Management_ Esset Management provides property management services (jointly owned property management and rental services) for B2B customers such as national and international insurance, real estate and financial institutions. Once contracts are signed and invoices are issued, revenue recognition follows IFRS 15. _Foncia Valorisation_ Foncia Valorisation provides investment strategy consulting and arbitrage (appraisals, lending, block/unit property sales) for institutional customers or wealthy families. Its revenue is recognized at the date the notarized final sale agreement is signed and is based on a percentage of the sale price. ----- _Leemo_ Leemo, a wholly owned subsidiary since 2017, is a listing service for properties for sale. It has developed a digital platform for property companies where it lists new real estate projects by different developers as well as certain older properties that are to be made available for sale to private and institutional investors. It derives its revenue from two main sources: - fees on sale agreements: amounts billed to developers and partially retroceded to business providers. Only the net margin is recognized in revenue; and - fees on bundles of services sold to developers without any retrocession requirements.

See “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain changes in _accounting standards and accounting policies.”_ (b) Data for 2018 has not been restated to reflect the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16. We began applying IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information. Under this approach, a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. However, following additional analyses carried out in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 15 (related to revenue from contracts with customers), in the year ended December 31, 2019, we changed our accounting presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to the reclassification of the contracts to be classified as contracts where we act as agent, as opposed to contracts where we act as principal as was previously the case, and the statement of profit and loss figures for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been restated accordingly. For further details see, “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain _changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—2018 Restatement” and “—Results of Operations—Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.”_ (c) In 2018, net loss from discontinued operations concerned the impairment of Somhome assets after the business was discontinued. _Revenue_ On a restated basis, revenue increased by €78.0 million, or 9.0%, from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €943.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in total revenue was mainly attributable to the impact of acquisitions carried out in 2019 for an amount of €73.2 million, an increase of €14.7 million in organic growth apart from our acquisitions and a positive currency effect of €2.5 million related to our business in Switzerland, with the average EUR/CHF exchange rate decreasing from 1.16 in 2018 to 1.11 in 2019 partially offset by negative impact of registration fees for an amount of €8.6 million. ----- The following table sets forth a breakdown of revenue by business for the periods indicated.

This increase was mainly attributable to the increase in revenue from our Joint Property Management business by €22.2 million, or 8.6%, from €258.9 million to €281.1 million and the increase in revenue from Lease Management and Renting by €13.4 million, or 5.0%, from €270.3 million to €283.6 million. This increase was mainly driven by price effect in Joint Property Management and in Lease Management, partially offset by customer turnover in Joint Property Management and Lease Management, and a decline in market conditions for the rental activity in 2019. Revenue for the Brokerage business (French network) increased by €11.3 million, or 9.5%, from €118 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

This increase was primarily driven by higher revenue from Assurimo due to the increased number of buildings that we managed, partially offset by lower revenue deriving from the B2B segment. Revenue for our International business increased by €17.6 million, or 19.4%, from €91.0 million to €108.6 million.

The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon certain conditions described further under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” The Indenture governing the Notes offered hereby will contain, and the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future opportunities and capital needs, or pursue business opportunities and activities.

These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Where applicable, a sensitivity analysis may be performed if the estimates are material. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. _Measurements used in testing goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment_ The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. As with any estimate, the assumptions used in these calculations are partly based on uncertain factors and may therefore need to be adjusted in subsequent periods. The notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum set out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same notes. _Measurement of leases_ IFRS 16 requires entities to use a significant degree of judgement as well as certain key estimates. These involve determining: - whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised; - the lease term; - the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments; and - the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the contract. The main assumptions we use to prepare the audited financial statements are described in the notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. _Measurement of provisions_ We use the best estimate of our commitments and obligations to calculate the corresponding provisions. _Measurement of employee benefits_ We operate both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. The notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum set out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. We consider that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. _Measurement of fair value (Level 1)_ We use fair value on a recurring basis in our statement of financial position to measure unlisted derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents. _Measurement of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax expense_ Our tax position is based on our best estimate of future taxable earnings. ----- _Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination_ The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount. _Assessment of criteria for identifying discontinued operations_ In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, we are required to exercise judgement in determining whether an asset or group of assets meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. IFRS 5 criteria are also used to identify any assets to be classified as discontinued operations. These assessments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in light of changes in the relevant facts and circumstances. In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, we use our judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements: - present a true and fair view of our financial position, financial performance and cash flows; - reflect the economic substance of transactions; and - are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The lease management business includes i) residential property management (gestion locative), i.e. services for an apartment or a house, and ii) commercial property management, i.e. services for retail buildings, notably shops and restaurants. It refers to the assistance on the day-to-day operations of the property typically related to financial management, legal assistance, conflict handling, etc., for an individual residential unit (which may be a joint property or condominium). On the lease management level, property management companies take care of tenancy agreements, rent collection, account and reporting, tax and insurance claims, maintenance or legal compliance. The property management providers are appointed by the owner of the individual unit(s), typically a private landlord. Joint property management refers to the management of joint property (copropriété), i.e. the management of shared property of joint ownership associations, activities include financial management, structural support and legal assistance. In the joint property management segment, the services provided include organization of general assemblies, a pre-determined number of visits per year for inspection, coordination of maintenance efforts and accounting, bill payment, and building fee collection. The property management provider assumes the role of trustee (syndic) after appointment by the general assembly of joint owners. It is important to note that lease management and joint property management activities can overlap with each other and fall under joint property management for the joint property and lease management for the individual unit. Exhibit 1: property management providers’ types of clients ###### Individual residential unit (lease management) _Source: International report provider_ Owner occupied apartments Rented apartments Vacant/secondary apartments ###### Shared parts of a joined property (joint property management) ----- Property management companies provide residential real estate services to B2C and B2B clients. The business model has different maturity levels in different geographies, for instance, B2B property management services are far more developed in Germany than in France where this segment is still growing significantly, notably following the COVID-19 pandemic. _Main Customers_ Property management companies address a variety of customers that can be divided into three main groups depending on the type of services provided to them. Typical lease management customers are private landlords and family offices. Private landlords are private individuals with real estate portfolios varying in size. They own the majority of residential units and a very small portion of office and retail buildings. Family offices are individuals who own a real estate portfolio, mainly composed of apartments and to a lesser extent, office and retail buildings. Typical joint property management customers are joint ownership associations or their boards, representing owners of a single property containing multiple units, such as apartments buildings. Typical B2B clients are institutional investors that acquire and manage real estate portfolios such as Axa, Allianz, BNP Paribas or Swiss Life.

Pricing for lease management is typically fixed as a percentage of rent (ranging from 2 to 10%, and on average 6 to 8% of annual rent). While prices in terms of percentages have remained stable, rent for residential real estate grew at 0.7% per annum from 2013 to 2019, with a trend of increased acceleration in recent past (1.7% from 2018 to 2019).

For example, rent limitation was re-enacted in Paris since July 2019, which set a 20% limit for premium over reference rent in each district, is expected to curb the upward trend for rent significantly. Furthermore, the impact of any future regulatory housing reforms is unclear. As shown by recent housing reforms, regulations can have significant impacts on rent price.

In the second and third quarter of 2020, the quarterly increases were +0.7% and +0.5%, respectively. The fourth quarter of 2020 saw a flattening of rent prices (at -0.1% quarter over quarter), however rent levels remain higher than what was observed by the end of 2019. Exhibit 14: Rent index evolution _Source: INSEE_ Finally, a new housing trend has emerged from the various constraining measures. There has been a shift among the urban population towards preferring greener areas as observed by Notaires de France. The experience of confinement and the already crowded urban hubs have pushed increasing numbers of homeowners and tenants to seek more rural properties, with gardens and greater interior space. This move from urban to sub-urban areas has also been reinforced by the possibility of undertaking and maintaining professional activities remotely. As a result, for real estate servicers, scale and the capillarity of their network became key to take advantage of this new housing habit. In summary, the residential segment has remained resilient through the COVID-19 pandemic while other segments of the real estate services market, such as offices or retail, have been negatively impacted by the proliferation of working from home practices or by the acceleration of e-commerce adoption due to government-ordered closure of certain physical shops.

Our business lines include: - Residential Real Estate Services (“RRES”): - _Joint property management (our “JPM business”): In our Joint Property Management business, we are mandated by landlords to manage jointly owned building areas and equipment and to ensure compliance with joint ownership regulations. We are the French market leader in Joint Property Management, managing over 1,463,402 dwellings in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. We are generally hired by an apartment building homeowners’ board to provide common services to all residents under contracts that are typically one year in length, subject to renewal.

We closed over 13,763 transactions in the year ended December 31, 2020 and our Brokerage business generated €125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. - Our other services include: - _B2B Services: Esset, our B2B business, comprises all lines of business with commercial and institutional customers. Our Esset business line includes Esset Management, our wealth management and consulting services for commercial and office properties firm, and Foncia Valorisation, which markets properties by blocks or lots. Our experience and expertise within multiple facets of the real estate services market allows us to provide a broad range of service offerings, including residential, commercial and corporate services, to these B2B customers. For example, we may provide services to an insurance institution, a B2B customer, that owns and rents residential apartments, commercial space and corporate office space and we are able to service their needs in each of these capacities. Our B2B business generated €34.5 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, we acquired Yxime and Perial to strengthen this B2B business. - _Digital Services: Our Digital Services business includes our businesses that rely on a digital platform and is comprised of Efficity, Lodgis and Leemo. Efficity is an online real estate valuation and brokerage activity operated with a business model based on independent sales agents. Lodgis is a real estate agency specialized in renting and selling furnished units and Leemo is a digital platform selling newly built properties. Our Digital Services business generated €42.8 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. - _Additional Ancillary Services: We have developed a strong and diversified portfolio of other brands and businesses that offer services that are complementary to our RRES and Brokerage businesses in order to enhance the value we provide to customers on our platform. These additional complementary services primarily include our specialized property insurance brokerage unit (Assurimo), our technical due diligence and inventories services unit (Constatimmo), our business-specific IT services (Seiitra), marketing of properties by blocks or lots (Foncia Valorisation) and technical homeowner maintenance solutions which we launched in France in 2019 (Techway). Our complementary services businesses generated €53.3 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also offer RRES, Brokerage and other services in our international businesses in Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 87% of our revenues were derived in France, and 7%, 5%, and 2% of our revenues were derived in Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, respectively. For a further detailed description of our businesses, see “—Our Businesses.” We were founded in 1972 and have since established ourselves as the leading European RRES, with over 10,000 employees across Europe as of December 31, 2020. Our recent growth has been marked by achievements in operations, digitization, our successful M&A track record and our IT and communications infrastructure. We believe our success is the result of a unique integrated ecosystem of real estate services providing the opportunity for cross-selling of recurring and additional services and growth through bolt-on acquisitions. The ----- following diagram provides a breakdown of our revenue by business for the for the year ended December 31, 2020: (1) Lease Management and Renting revenues also include revenue generated from interest income on our customer accounts, Foncia Immo Neuf and Holiday Rental. (2) Ancillary Services revenues include intercompany sales. The RRES market in the jurisdictions in which we operate remains largely fragmented. According to a third-party report prepared in 2019 the French property management market was estimated to be worth approximately €12 billion (excluding rental services and brokerage), of which approximately €5.3 billion was under external management, along with an estimated €1.2 billion market for rental services. However, greater regulation in France and the increasing need to invest in the digitization of services has made it more difficult and time consuming for private landlords to keep property management in-house, leading to the increased outsourcing and penetration rate of properties under external management in the residential property management market. These trends towards increased regulation and digitization have also led to the growing consolidation of the highly fragmented market, enabling us to capitalize on small bolt-on, strategic acquisitions and increase our market positioning and scale. Our size provides us with a competitive advantage against smaller and local competitors as we can industrialize processes to better leverage our cost base, replicate best practices across our network to ensure consistent quality of service and adapt more easily to regulatory changes. As a result, we made 61 acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2020, both in our primary French market and in other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management dwellings and approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings and approximately €111.0 million of acquired revenues. We have a robust acquisition pipeline in France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and a strong team of approximately 28 employees and 10 trainees dedicated to post acquisition integration.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

As of August 2019, we were the number one player in the French real estate services market, with approximately 13% market share, according to an international report provider. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we managed approximately 1.8 million dwellings in France, which is approximately two times the number of dwellings managed by our next closest competitor according to publically available information for the year ended 2020. Outside of France, we hold leading positions in Switzerland and Germany and have a strong presence in Belgium and Luxembourg. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we operated ----- over 100 branches in these countries, which collectively accounted for 13% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our scale, operations and service offerings provide us with a clear competitive advantage. Our centralized processes result in lower internal costs and enable improved customer service compared to our typically small, individual-owned competitors. Our comprehensive range of innovative services, such as FONCIA 24/7 (our assistance service for our joint property management customers), Prowen (our centralized energy service that reduces client costs on gas and electricity), and Assurimo, (our real estate insurance service), differentiate us from competitors. Our comprehensive network of over 500 branches covering all major French cities is one of the largest offerings in the market and results in close proximity to our customers and the dwellings that we manage; unique market positioning in negotiations with third-party repair and maintenance service suppliers resulting in decreased costs; and financial resources that allow us to expand our customer portfolio through acquisitions. We have been able to successfully enter markets through acquisitions and expanded our operating geography, despite the regulatory and technological requirements that create barriers to participation in the real estate services market. Our regional and national regulatory and real estate industry expertise and our leadership team’s extensive experience in the real estate services industry are key to meeting and complying with such requirements. Our strong reputation for quality and service and multi-branded strategy have also supported our ability to grow in existing markets and enter new markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.2,Loyal and diverse customer base and synergetic business model in a resilient market,"Our large and diversified client base, integrated ecosystem of residential real estate services and high customer retention rates drive a high level of recurring revenues (75% in the year ended December 31, 2020). We have grown our diversified customer base to approximately 1.5 million dwellings in our French Joint Property Management business and over 330,000 dwellings in our French Lease Management business as at December 31, 2020. Through our synergetic business model, we are able to cross sell our services to our diverse customer portfolio across our business lines, which in turn leads to further organic growth. For example, our proven ability to cross-sell is highlighted by the high penetration rates of Assurimo, our specialized property insurance brokerage unit (providing property insurance, homeowners’ insurance policies and brokerage services) through which we currently provide insurance services to 61% of our French Joint Property Management buildings. Similarly, we currently provide technical services to approximately 88% of our Lease Management customers through our dedicated business, Constatimmo. We believe that we are well positioned to target new customers, including B2B customers, given our knowledge regarding fulfilling requirements for our B2C customers. The addressable markets in which we operate are characterized by high outsourcing rates, with a high and stable portion of joint property or condominium owners (85% in France) under external management, as of August 2019 using services like our Joint Property Management business. Property owners tend to rely on expert services such as ours due to the volume of work and amount of legal and accounting know-how required to directly interface with tenants and other counterparties. Moreover, landlords rarely switch leasing managers during a tenancy, given the risks and costs involved in switching service providers and the limited potential benefit. We believe that through the integrated ecosystem of high-quality services we consistently provide we have established high customer retention rates, and long lasting customer relationships, certain of which last more than 20 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we lost only 3.5% and 8.4% of customers from our Joint Property Management and Lease Management businesses, respectively. Moreover, 36% of our customers from our Joint Property Management business in France entered into contracts of three or more years and 24% for two to three years for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to our broad and diverse customer base, we are not reliant on any particular customer. According to an international report provider, the French property management market is estimated to be €12.2 billion in August 2019, of which €5.3 billion is captured by property management companies, with the rest serviced in-house. The externally serviced property management market has grown by approximately 2% annually between 2015 and 2019. This stable growth has been driven by population dynamics and the construction of collective units. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow through acquisition of customer portfolios, cross-selling of related services to our large client base and the addition of new revenue opportunities for our existing services. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Our trend of improving EBITDA conversion rates has continued with a Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate, of approximately 76% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 71% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Despite our regular M&A activity, our discretionary spend on acquisitions provides us with flexibility to manage our cash flow and reduce our financial leverage. Further, our business requires limited maintenance capital expenditures, (accounting for approximately 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020), and is characterized by limited working capital requirements. Our revenue increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 up from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our margin resilience is supported by an adaptable cost structure for the more cyclical flow Brokerage business, as Brokerage salary costs include a significant variable portion that is indexed on commissions. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 26.9%, 26.8% and 22.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our recurring, stable revenue is in part due to our complementary business profiles across our branches, experienced management and sales force teams, and fee-based services in connection with our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Renting businesses which accounted for 69% of our revenue in France for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, our high proportion of recurring revenues (75% in 2020) and balanced portfolio of services split between stock and flow businesses with limited correlation have supported our resilience during adverse economic conditions, achieving a substantially stable performance in 2020 despite unprecedented government measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Since 2017, we have upgraded a significant portion of our IT and communication infrastructure including utilizing a mix of integrated and outsourced solutions, transitioning to a single telecom provider, and streamlining our finance and human resources functions with Workday, which enabled us to quickly and effectively transition to a work-from-home environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also leveraged our technological know-how combined with our knowledge of the real estate industry to design and launch a go-live version of our new ERP system, Millenium, which we have piloted at one of our branches in France in 2020. Millenium integrates all of our IT and resource planning functions into one database to better meet our customers’ needs and address internal business challenges. Millenium increases the digitization of our activities with the aim of helping customers by creating greater transparency and improving our operations with standardized, digital processes to increase efficiency and to improve the speed at which we can serve our customers. We believe our high levels of investment in IT for our corporate platform and customer interface service such as over recent years give us a competitive edge in the current environment. The digitization, standardization and automation offered by Millenium complement our already synergetic business model and will allow us to more quickly leverage our customer database to identify cross-selling opportunities leading to greater operating efficiencies and inter-business synergies. We believe that Millenium’s compatibility with big data, AI and IoT, will allow us to explore new business opportunities and provide access to a number of revenue-enhancing opportunities. For example, we are developing a new operational model called “Agency of the Future” which will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real estate services and aims at improving client satisfaction and reducing our customer churn rate, which we believe will, in turn, lead to greater opportunities for organic growth. In addition, we believe that the gains of Millenium and the development of Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in 2022.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we made 61 acquisitions in our primary French market and in other geographies, representing approximately 60,000 new Lease Management dwellings and approximately 171,000 new Joint Property Management dwellings and approximately €111.0 million of acquired revenues. We completed 61 acquisitions which contributed to our Adjusted EBITDA that reached €286.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €258.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consolidation is a natural trend in the highly fragmented markets we operate in, accelerated by increasing regulations, and we play a key role in the market by defining new quality standards and unrivalled execution processes.

We believe that the collective industry knowledge and leadership of our management team positions them well to continue our successful organic and external growth and execute our strategies. Further, our management team encourages growth through a focus on operational efficiency and innovation including through the management’s dynamic external growth policy that enabled us to, among others, establish our market leading presence in Germany, successfully divest our non-core businesses to focus on our core, synergetic businesses and more recently, by the ongoing overhaul of our IT infrastructure, including the development of Millenium and enabling our planned transition to our new operational model, “Agency of the Future.” This is demonstrated by the consistent increase in our revenues which increased at a CAGR of 5.4% and was €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (€1,013 million excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic) up from €865.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Our most recent digital innovation, Millenium, an in-house developed ERP system that is device-agnostic, cloud-based and driven by artificial intelligence, will allow us to fully digitalize all of our businesses and establish a highly personalized digital relationship with our customers. We believe that Millenium will also allow us to better, more efficiently serve our customers, cross-sell across our platforms and therefore capture greater market share from existing customers and generate business from new customers. Our IT and data platforms are subject to a process of continuous improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investments, such as the team of over 80 developers and specialized professional we hired to create Millenium. We believe that our robust investments in our IT and data platforms provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses have been required to transition to a work-from-home environment. Additionally, our ongoing and historical use of big data, AI and IoT to create new business opportunities enables us to maintain a cutting edge development program while minimizing the risks traditionally associated with experimentation. For example, we are in the process of developing our new operational model, Agency of the Future, which we believe will generate significant gains, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain tasks that were previously done manually, such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges. Since 2018, we have invested approximately €100 million into our IT projects, and we believe that the gains of Millenium and Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €15 million in 2022. ----- We have developed, and continue to develop, innovative solutions based on emerging trends that are aimed at providing our customers with the highest quality, optimal solutions for their real estate needs.

130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.16,Our Businesses,18.16.1,Residential Real Estate Services (France),"The residential real estate services in France, operating primarily under the Foncia brand, represented 60% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 61% of our total revenue generated in France for ----- the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue from this business primarily comprises (i) jointly owned property management fees, (ii) rental management fees (including rent payment and occupancy guarantee fees), and (iii) letting fees, which allow us to maintain stable revenues. _Management of Jointly Owned Properties_ In our Joint Property Management business, we assist our customers in managing common building areas, features and costs in their jointly owned properties by providing technical and accounting management. These management services include (i) providing information and communicating on a regular basis with the joint property owners, (ii) organizing and managing general meetings of joint property owners by preparing the agenda, summons, minutes, etc., (iii) managing the upkeep of the joint property as a whole, (iv) controlling costs by drawing up a budget, (v) obtaining bids from potential suppliers, (vi) providing a breakdown of joint property charges, (vii) collecting funds and amounts due for the joint property accounts, (viii) providing bookkeeping services, (ix) monitoring contract performance, and (x) providing mass procurement offers for joint property owners and leveraging our large purchasing power to offer attractive prices to our customers on expenses such as gas and other utilities. We also provide direct access to all Foncia services on a unique customer portal, MyFoncia, and offer around-the-clock customer service. From a contractual and legal perspective, our Joint Property Management business is conducted primarily through mandates. We take the role of trustee (syndic) after appointment by the homeowners’ board or general assembly of joint owners. We calculate fees on a flat-rate basis, which leads to relatively stable and recurring revenue. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, including (i) preparing, convening and organizing general meetings, (ii) managing the joint owners’ council or general assembly (iii) managing the financial operations, including bill payments and collection of building fees, (iv) keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association (v) managing the jointly owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations and (vi) carrying out periodic visits and inspections of the jointly owned property. We also receive additional incidental fees such as transfer fees when a landlord selling a dwelling requires a book balance report called a “transfer report,” reminder fees, fees on insurance-related claim management services, maintenance and repair commissions on third parties invoices and additional post office charges. These variable fees comprise 23% of our total Joint Property Management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020. All such services are treated as an overall performance. These different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., the management of the jointly owned property association. Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,463,402 dwellings under our management of jointly owned properties, generating a revenue of €290.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 30% of our total revenue for the same period. _Lease Management and Renting_ Our Lease Management and Renting business is comprised of Lease Management and rental services. On the Lease Management side of the business, we manage an owner’s-lessor’s rented apartment and provide assistance on the day-to-day operations of the property, typically related to financial management, legal assistance and handling conflicts. We are appointed by the owner of the individual unit, typically a private landlord, and we act as agent for owners-lessors to fulfil a number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These key services primarily include: (i) routine management services such as rent reviews and collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, and sending rent receipts and deposits to lessees, (ii) other one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of documentation, management of claims, administrative filings and requests for subsidies, (iii) technical management services, such as coordinating on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys and preparation of essential information documents for lessees, (iv) insurance against unpaid rent and (v) other insurance such as for vacant premises or property damage. Lease Management fees are comprised of a base fee for the contracted services described above and, in some instances, other additional fees such as fees in connection with helping file tax forms or fees related to rent payment guarantees. We offer rent payment guarantees (“Garantie de loyers impayés” or “rent payment guarantee”) to certain residential landlords in France for whom we provide property management services and an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation” or “occupancy guarantee”) to a small number of lessors to ----- protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant for selected apartments in new dwellings. In December 2020, approximately 66% of residential dwellings in France were covered by the rent payment guarantee, and approximately 12% of rentals are covered by the occupancy guarantee. We believe we have a strong ability to assess credit risk when offering these guarantees and undertake a detailed process to select eligible tenants and dwellings. We refer to the new unpaid rents as a result of defaults under the occupancy guarantee each month as “flow of unpaid rent,” and the total sum of unpaid rents per month as our “stock of unpaid rent.” In December 2020, €124.7 million of rent revenues were covered by the rent payment guarantee, for which we experienced €3.5 million unpaid rent (for a 2020 average new monthly aggregate of unpaid rent of €3.3 million) and the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent was €27.7 million, including outstanding rent payments from previous years. Once rent is reported as unpaid, any payments to landlords under these guarantees are recorded in full as a provision on our balance sheet. By underwriting rent payment guarantees and occupancy guarantees on our own balance sheet, we believe we offer a differentiating and competitive service to customers that smaller competitors would not be able to deliver. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Rent payment and occupancy guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_ As of December 31, 2020, we had 330,005 dwellings under management in our Lease Management and Renting business, generating a revenue of €283.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 30% of our total revenue for the same period (this includes Foncia Immo Neuf, CAI and Holiday Rental). Revenues are driven by rent evolution, fees as a percent of rent (on units acquired), and add-on services and volumes are driven by apartments under lease management and tenant mobility rates. We operate primarily in the residential real estate services market, but manage certain commercial real estate properties through Esset. See “—Other _Services (France).”_ Through our renting services, we aim to minimize the vacancy rates of the properties by helping landlords find a suitable tenant and helping tenants find a property to rent. For landlords, we manage the sourcing, screening, and contracting of new tenants, and provide services such as posting advertisements on various real estate portals, showcasing their properties in Foncia branches and providing structured feedback on renting efforts. For tenants, we assist lessees with leasing rental properties and we receive one-off placement fees for these services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we assisted with 59,288 rentals. Our services include access to a large number of rental home insurance packages and fixture inventory programs offered by professionals who are available on short notice.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

From ----- inception, we have appreciated the importance of creating an efficient platform in order to better serve our customers, and understand the dynamics of our market and improve our employees responsiveness and efficiency. IT systems impact virtually all aspects of our business, including record keeping, customer information processing and storage, data security, marketing and sales, compliance logistics, and practice and performance management. Our IT strategy is driven by the dual goals of promoting growth of our business while ensuring data security. Our most recent digital innovation is Millenium, our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system that we developed in-house, and we launched a go-live version of it in March 2020 at one of our branches in France. We have invested significant resources in Millenium, including a team of 80 developers and specialized professionals in order to build this innovative and advanced real estate platform, and we aim to roll it out across our branches in France in 2022. Millenium includes numerous functionalities and unifies a number of our IT functions at our head office under one centralized database. It is managed by an experienced team of information specialists. Business applications for each of our activities have been developed with Millenium, including our Joint Property Management business, Lease Management and Renting business, and Brokerage Business, as well as our accounting department, support call center and web and mobile applications. Millenium is equipped with an application interface program, which is a technology that allows for a direct access to other software solutions, startups, and business partners. For example, Millenium is connected to Kyriba, an online platform for viewing bank transaction in real time, which we use to manage our Joint Property Management cash transactions involving approximately 116,000 bank accounts. Millenium also functions with Docapost, an online, information technology company, which we utilize to collect and scan checks, and send and receive approximately 8.8 million letters and invoices per year. Millenium will provide, among other features, (i) increased digitization of activities, including the ability to use online signatures and receive digital payments, (ii) greater transparency with our customers, as employee progress on customer matters can be seen in real time and customer calls are tracked using tickets, (iii) significant automation of the accounting activities, (iv) the ability to better leverage our customer database to create inter-business synergies in compliance with European GDPR regulations, and (v) standardized processes across our businesses and substantial efficiencies due to a high degree of automation. Millenium also includes MyFoncia, a web and mobile app platform designed to improve customer experience through automation, digitization, and improved productivity for our customers to use for all of their service needs. In parallel to the deployment of Millenium, we are in the process of designing a new operational model called Agency of the Future which will be implemented following the roll-out of Millenium in France in 2022. Agency of the Future will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real estate services and aims to improve client satisfaction, reducing our customer churn rate and, in turn, leading to greater opportunities for organic growth. See “Summary—Our Strengths—Continuous investments in operational improvement through our _innovative technology platforms reinforces our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains.”_ In the coming years, we plan to fully digitalize all business lines, internal processes, and our customer relationship management. In addition, we aim to increase our use of big data, artificial intelligence and IoT and continue to further automate our accounting. We believe that the improved standardization and digitization Millenium offers, will allow us to reduce administrative inefficiencies and achieve greater productivity. In addition, we believe that Millenium will enable us to achieve greater organization among our businesses allowing our employees to focus on customer satisfaction with the potential to lead to improved customer retention.

Our ability to obtain, retain and process such personal data is governed by data protection and privacy regulations and guidance issued by, among others, the European Union, national regulators and, where applicable, recommendations and best practices developed by trade associations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)) became effective as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR provides a common framework for data protection and privacy and regulates the Processing and transfer of Personal Data in the European Union. In the course of our activities, we may be qualified as “Controllers,” or as “Processor,” as defined and governed by GDPR, depending on the services provided and the service agreement entered into. We established our compliance program with GDPR quite early and we comply with the GDPR obligations, and rights for individuals whose Personal Data we Process (“Data Subjects”), including, among others: - accountability and transparency obligations, requiring us to demonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR, including the maintenance of detailed records of Personal Data Processing activities; - appointment of a data protection officer, subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria; - requirements to Process Personal Data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, to Process Personal Data only to the extent necessary for the purposes required, maintain the accuracy of Personal Data, limit the retention of Personal Data for no longer than is necessary, and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures against unauthorized Processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage to Personal Data; - an obligation to provide clear notice of Personal Data Processing activities to Data Subjects, which must include, among other details: the identity of the Controller and the Processor; the nature and purpose of the Processing activities; the legal basis applicable to each Processing activity; the categories of Personal Data Processed, the recipients to whom the Personal Data are disclosed; the rights of the Data Subjects; and details of any cross-border transfers of Personal Data; - an obligation to include certain mandatory contractual terms in agreements with certain service providers which Process Personal Data on our behalf; - restrictions on the export of Personal Data to recipients located in countries outside of the European Economic Area; ----- - requirements to ensure, for each Processing activity, that either (i) there is a valid legal basis in place; or (ii) an exemption or derogation applies; - obligations to consider data protection issues with respect to the development of any new products or services which involve the Processing of Personal Data (“data protection by design”), and to ensure that by default, the amount of Personal Data Processed is limited to what is necessary in the context of the relevant Processing activity (“data protection by default”); - a requirement to undertake a data protection impact assessment with respect to Processing activities that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of relevant Data Subjects; - obligations to comply with the data protection rights conferred on Data Subjects including, in certain circumstances: a right of access to, and rectification of, Personal Data; a right to obtain restriction of Processing; a right to object to Processing; a right to request that Personal Data be transferred to another Controller; a right not to be subject to certain types of profiling or automated decision-making; and a right to request erasing Personal Data; and - an obligation to notify Personal Data Breaches to Supervisory Authorities without undue delay and no later than 72 hours after detection of the relevant Personal Data Breach, except where the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, and an obligation to notify affected Data Subjects without undue delay, unless the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected Data Subjects. The GDPR has therefore strengthened the individual rights of individuals over their personal data and imposes strict requirements on companies processing personal data. In addition, the GDPR introduces fines for serious breaches of up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide revenue or €20 million. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the fine level to impose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data Subjects also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress) in certain circumstances. Data Subjects may bring complaints via the courts, or via Supervisory Authorities, or both, and in some circumstances may have a choice as to the EU Member State(s) in which they bring such claims. We accomplished a review of our data polices with the aim of minimizing data collection and storage so that only the appropriate amount of personal data required for any particular purpose is processed, and establishing protocols to destroy unnecessary datasets and anonymize data wherever possible. In addition, we have put in place and implemented rules, policies and procedures that we strive to maintain and improve, in order to ensure compliance with GDPR. These rules, policies and procedures are twofold: internal and external. These rules, policies and procedures, implemented at all levels of our business, apply to the processing of personal data, data storage, retention, preservation, maintenance, protection and management of personal data within the course of our business operations, as well as the transfer of personal data. Our legal team was intensely involved in the implementation of such rules, policies and procedures and reviewed our activities and operations to implement a legal framework that complies with the GDPR requirements. We believe that we are compliant in all material respects with applicable data protection regulations and we submitted all the relevant declarations to the national regulators, the CNIL (Commission Nationale de _l’Informatique et des Libertés) in France and the BfDI (Der Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit) in Germany and the APD (Autorité de protection des données) in Belgium.

The Hoguet law requires the execution of specific administrative formalities to be a professional real estate agent including: - holding a professional card (“carte professionnelle”) issued by the president of the territorial chamber of commerce and industry, which is subject to professional aptitude and morality conditions and is renewable every 3 years; - having a financial guarantee from a bank or professional organization for funds held in customer accounts and retaining professional liability insurance. In accordance with this law, we provide financial guarantees to customers equal to the maximum amount of funds held in their account. The customer’s deposit must be held in a third-party account and be guaranteed by a third party financial guarantor, such as Société de caution mutuelle des professions immobilières et foncières (SOCAF). This body guarantees reimbursement of any funds deposited with them for purchase. The name of the financial guarantor must be displayed in the agents office. Professional real estate agents must have a written mandate authorizing them to negotiate or enter into contracts on behalf of the owner or the property lessor. This mandate must therefore be finalized before any act of mediation or negotiation begins. This mandate must indicate the level of the fees or commission (honoraires) that will be payable and just who will pay it, the buyer or the seller. We maintain a register of such agreements with each agreement numbered and recorded in accordance with the Hoguet Law. Once the mandate is signed, the real estate agent is entitled to a commission in the event of the sale or lease of the property, subject to the mandate. The real estate agent’s right to commission is subject to multiple conditions and no sum of money may be demanded or remitted to the real estate agent before the transaction (i.e. sale, rental, etc.) is concluded and recorded in an act containing the commitment of the parties. The collection of a sum of money in violation of the Hoguet law is an offense punishable by up to two years’ imprisonment and a maximum fine of €30,000. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The introduction of the ALUR law has had a number of effects in the way we conduct our operations across our core service offerings, including: - _Joint property management: The_ ALUR law imposes a mandatory obligation on us as joint property managers to register each joint property we manage with the national matriculation register if not yet registered and also requires us to create two dedicated bank accounts for each joint property we manage. The law also introduces model joint property agreements that are applicable in our joint property management service. - _Rental management and lettings: The ALUR law regulates which fees can and cannot be charged to tenants and how fees should be shared between tenants and landlords. Depending on the property’s location, it imposes a limit on the renting commission paid by tenants to an amount that must not exceed between €11-€15 per square meter. In addition to this fee cap, tenants can no longer be charged penalties for breaches to rental agreements or for rent payment notices.

The law created a new lease called a “mobility lease,” which is a non-renewable lease between one to ten months for certain categories of tenants, such as students and trainees, with flexible termination terms that allow the termination of a lease by the tenant upon the provision of only one months’ notice. Within municipalities of more than 50,000 inhabitants, where there is an imbalance between the supply and demand of housing, the law also imposes an obligation on landlords to set their rent within a range defined by the authorities each year.

This plan has had a direct impact on fees that property managers can charge for their services. For example, it restricts the freedom of the landlord and tenant to contract with regards to expenses which cannot be recovered from tenants. Non-recoverable expenses include structural repairs and repairs under article 606 of the French Civil Code, taxes such as the “Territorial Economic Contribution” where the landlord is personally liable for payment and the management fees of the landlord linked to rents management. As a result, landlords are no longer able to recover fees from tenants for certain expenses for major repairs, regional economic contribution taxes and fees related to rental management. The PINEL plan also introduced rules governing commercial leases including rules limiting the ability of a landlord to impose rental increases and granting tenants a right of first refusal in the event of the sale of leased commercial property.

This law introduces, in article ----- L411-1 of the Code of Civil Enforcement Procedures (code de procédure civile), the condition that an eviction can only take place by virtue of a court decision where the occupiers were notified. A tenant can be evicted for failure to pay the rent when due and also for breaches of lease agreements. In the event that the tenant fails to pay rent, the landlord is required to follow various mandatory steps, including filing of a payment instruction notice (Commandement de payer). This notice sets a time limit for a tenant to pay the outstanding rental and must delivered by a bailiff (huissier de justice). The time limits provided by this notice are two months for a residential lease and one month for a commercial lease. If the tenant fails to pay the rental arears within the stipulated time, the landlord can apply to the court for the cancellation of the lease. Upon the determination of the court proceedings, the court will often provide for an installment payment of the rent arrears and stipulate that the tenant voluntarily move out within a period of two months. The bailiff and the police will forcibly remove the tenant if the tenant fails to move out within this period. _Winter Truce_ The winter truce is the period during which any tenant eviction measure is suspended. This rule was introduced on July 9, 1991 (Loi n° 91-650 du 9 juillet 1991 portant réforme des procédures civiles d’exécution). The regime provides that a landlord can begin proceedings during the winter truce to seek to evict tenants who do not pay rent, or who refuse to leave after receiving the contractual notice period. However, eviction requires a court order from a judge, which can be appealed by the tenant. Once a final judgment is made, the landlord is able to give an eviction order to the tenant with a minimum notice period of at least two months for the tenant to vacate the leased premises (the length of this period will depend on the court order). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the eviction of the tenant cannot take place during the winter truce, which is in effect between November 1 and March 1 of the following year. In 2014, the ALUR law expanded the winter truce period to five full months, from November 1 to March 31 of the following year. This period was extended to July 10 as an exceptional measure for 2020 only, as part of the emergency measures taken by the French government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The terms of the deposit should explain what the deposit is expected to cover. For example, the rental deposit terms can provide that the rent, repairs, service charge, dilapidations and rates are covered. These terms could also be widely drafted to cover any liabilities owed by the tenant at the end of the tenancy. The amount of the deposit is, in part, regulated by the law which provides that the maximum amount of the deposit for unfurnished properties will be one month, with no maximum for furnished properties. The rent deposit paid at the beginning of the tenancy must be refunded at the end of the rental period. The landlord or their representative has one month to refund the security deposit if the final inventory is consistent with the initial inventory and if there is no outstanding rent or tax to be paid. This period may be extended to two months if there are differences between the initial and final inventories. The time frame to refund the deposit begins on the day the tenant returns the keys for the premises (in person or by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt). In the event the security deposit is not refunded, the outgoing tenant must send a formal demand to the landlord by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt. If, despite this action being taken, the landlord refuses to refund the security deposit, the tenant can refer the case to the regional mediation commission (Commission _Départementale de Conciliation). If this mediation process proves unsuccessful, the tenant can then go before_ the small-claims court (juge de proximité) if the value of the claim is less than €4,000, or the district court (tribunal d’instance). If the amount of the security deposit exceeds €4,000, the tenant must send an assignation, which will be prepared and delivered by a bailiff to the landlord. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company, the Guarantors and the Pledged Opcos generated 54.3% of our consolidated EBITDA (and 33.8% excluding Pledged Opcos). As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes had €7.4 million of indebtedness, excluding accrued interest, bank overdraft and deposits and guarantees received. Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Company and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Definitions— _Indebtedness.”_ In addition, as described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of the Company or a Guarantor, will also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The insolvency laws of France and_ ----- _the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ A portion of the operations of the Company are conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation _on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Senior Secured Notes_ Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under “Optional _Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable_ redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of ----- Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on, at the Company’s option, the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred, provided _that notwithstanding anything in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Company may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on ----- the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness, and further provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitted such Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own ----- affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, together with the proceeds from Topco Notes to be issued by Topco on the Issue Date and drawings under the Senior Term Loan (i) to repay amounts outstanding under our Existing Senior Facilities, (ii) as funds earmarked for identified acquisitions anticipated to close during the first half of 2021, (iii) to make a distribution to shareholders and (iv) to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Senior Notes Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Notes,” references to “Senior Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Senior Notes.

130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.6,Notes Guarantees,61.6.1,General,"The obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer pursuant to the Senior Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control Triggering Event, will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior subordinated basis by the Guarantors (each, a “Notes Guarantee” and together, the “Notes Guarantees”). For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company, the Guarantors and the Pledged Opcos generated 54.3% of our consolidated EBITDA (and 33.8% excluding Pledged Opcos). As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Senior Notes had €7.4 million of indebtedness, excluding accrued interest, bank overdraft and deposits and guarantees received. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Notes Indenture. See “Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.”_ In addition, as described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer that guarantee the Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor, will also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Each Series of Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—The insolvency laws of France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ A portion of the operations of the Senior Notes Issuer are conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of nonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

As a result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to Holders of the Notes in respect of such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For example, the ability of the Trustee or the Holders to take enforcement action with respect to the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the Holders will not be able to enforce the Note Guarantees until the expiration of the applicable standstill period for so long as amounts under Senior Indebtedness remain outstanding. In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of the Company pursuant to an enforcement of security over shares of the Company taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. See “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that_ holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Senior Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.

Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable.

The Security Interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Security Documents. The Shared Collateral will also secure on a first-priority basis the liabilities under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations, and may also secure certain future Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Interests in the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “Certain Covenants— _Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Notes Issuer and the_ Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Senior Notes, as permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Security Interests in the Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_ Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Notes Indenture will provide that certain property, rights and assets may not be_ pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles.

See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.” In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The circumstances in which the holders of the Senior Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of the Security Interests over the Shared Collateral are significantly limited. Generally, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the holders of first-ranking security interests in the Shared Collateral will be entitled to control virtually all decisions relating to the exercise of remedies with respect to these security interests, will be able to block enforcement of such security interests, will be able to release the security interests constituting Shared Collateral in certain circumstances and will receive any proceeds from the enforcement of those security interests before amounts will be available to the holders of the Senior Notes.

The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. The Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent (or, if the collateral represented by the Security Documents is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, that creditor) will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes, except through the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (or such creditor) for the Collateral (as applicable).

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Senior Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer. The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Senior Notes Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Senior Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in_ the Senior Notes Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Senior Notes Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions under the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant the Senior Notes Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s option, the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred, provided _that notwithstanding anything in the Senior Notes Indenture, for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Senior Notes Issuer may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness, and further provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitted such Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that the Senior Notes Issuer shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Senior Notes Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is denominated in a currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euro that is actually received by the Senior Notes Issuer upon converting such portion into Euros. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted (or reasonably expected to be converted) by the Senior Notes ----- Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalent Investments within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Senior Notes Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during the same fiscal year, not to exceed the greater of (x) €80.0 million and (y) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) (with unused amounts in any fiscal year being carried forward to the next succeeding fiscal year and amounts that will not be used in the subsequent fiscal year being carried back to the immediately preceding fiscal year); (6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and (7) any combination of the consideration specified in paragraphs (1) to (6) above. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relative to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Senior Notes Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Senior Notes Issuer from purchasing any Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Senior Notes Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Senior Notes Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes under such instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Holders may not enforce the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Senior Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Notes Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity, security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security, indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of such satisfactory security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and ----- (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Senior Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Senior Notes Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Senior Notes Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Senior Notes has occurred.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.

Assuming such position is respected, a US holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such US holder’s method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, US holders would be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of a note.

130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.1,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences,62.1.2,Payments of Stated Interest,"Payments of stated interest on a Note (including additional amounts, if any, paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld, if any) generally will be includible in the gross income of a US holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the US holder’s regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. Interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the US foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the US dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. A cash basis US holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each interest accrual period (or portion thereof) equal to the US dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such accrual period (or portion thereof within the US holder’s taxable year)determined by translating such amount into US dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the accrual period (or portion thereof) (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the US holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual method US holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing US holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the US holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the US dollar value of such payment, translated at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the US dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as US-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-US withholding tax paid (or deemed paid) by a US holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for US federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a US holder’s particular circumstances.

If a US holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the US dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase. The conversion of US ----- dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a US holder. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be includible in income as ordinary interest income in accordance with the US holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the US holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of that amount translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual method taxpayer) will determine the US dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method US holder that cannot or does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the exchange rates on the trade date and settlement date. Holders will recognize currency gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates during the period in which the US holder held such Notes. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will generally be equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the US holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined (1) using the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and (2) using the spot rate on the date the US holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the US holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for US foreign tax credit limitation purposes. All foreign currency gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not as an adjustment of interest income. Any gain or loss recognized by a US holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be US source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of a non-corporate US holder (including an individual), any such gain may be eligible for preferential US federal income tax rates if the US holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

This discussion does not address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, US expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, US holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (or investors in such entities or arrangements), persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the applicable series of Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “US holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for US federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity classified as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a US person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the US federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of US federal estate and gift tax laws, the US federal Medicare tax on net investment income, and state, local, non-US or other tax laws. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the relevant Issuer with respect to the relevant Notes, as applicable, will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non _coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other_ than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, irrespective of the holder’s fiscal domicile or registered headquarters. If such payments are made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments (subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated each year. Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the relevant Issuer’s taxable result if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account held in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219-I of the French Tax Code, 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate of 12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code nor, to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of such Deductibility ----- Exclusion will apply in respect of the Notes if the relevant Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest and assimilated revenues in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

As such, the Senior Notes Issuer will be required to annually report to the Luxembourg tax authorities personal and financial information related, inter alia, to the identification of, holdings by and payments made to (i) certain holders of Senior Notes qualifying as Reportable Persons and (ii) Controlling Persons of passive non-financial entities (“NFEs”) which are themselves Reportable Persons. This information, as exhaustively set out in Annex I of the CRS Law (the “Information”), will include personal data related to the Reportable Persons. The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to satisfy its reporting obligations under the CRS Law will depend on each holder of Senior Notes providing the Senior Notes Issuer with the Information, along with the required supporting documentary evidence. In this context, the holders of Senior Notes are hereby informed that, as data controller, the Senior Notes Issuer will process the Information for the purposes as set out in the CRS Law. Holders of Senior Notes qualifying as passive NFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Person(s), if applicable, of the processing of their Information by the Senior Notes Issuer. Additionally, the Senior Notes Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each Holder of Senior Notes has a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if necessary). Any data obtained by the Senior Notes Issuer are to be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation. The holders of Senior Notes are further informed that the Information related to Reportable Persons will be disclosed to the Luxembourg tax authorities annually for the purposes set out in the CRS Law. The Luxembourg tax authorities will, under their own responsibility, eventually exchange the reported information to the competent authority of the Reportable Jurisdiction(s). In particular, Reportable Persons are informed that certain operations performed by them will be reported to them through the issuance of statements, and that part of this information will serve as a basis for the annual disclosure to the Luxembourg tax authorities. Similarly, the holders of Senior Notes undertake to inform the Senior Notes Issuer within thirty (30) days of receipt of these statements should any included personal data not be accurate. The holders of Senior Notes further undertake to immediately inform the Senior Notes Issuer of, and provide the Senior Notes Issuer with all supporting documentary evidence of any changes related to the Information after occurrence of such changes. Although the Senior Notes Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid any fines or penalties imposed by the CRS Law, no assurance can be given that the Senior Notes Issuer will be able to satisfy these obligations. If the Senior Notes Issuer becomes subject to a fine or penalty as a result of the CRS Law, the value of the Notes held by the holders of Senior Notes may suffer material losses. ----- Any Holder of Senior Notes that fails to comply with the Company’s Information or documentation requests may be held liable for penalties imposed on the Senior Notes Issuer as a result of such holder of Senior Notes’ failure to provide the Information and the Senior Notes Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Senior Notes of such holder of Senior Notes. _FATCA_ Capitalised terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the FATCA Law (as defined below), unless otherwise provided herein.

As part of the process of implementing FATCA, the US government has negotiated intergovernmental agreements with certain foreign jurisdictions which are intended to streamline reporting and compliance requirements for entities established in such foreign jurisdictions and subject to FATCA. Luxembourg has entered into a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement implemented by the FATCA Law which requires Financial Institutions located in Luxembourg to report, when required, information on Financial Accounts held by Specified US Persons, if any, to the Luxembourg tax authorities (administration des _contributions directes)._ Under the terms of the amended Luxembourg law of July 24, 2015 implementing the Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement signed between Luxembourg and the United States of America on March 28, 2014 (the “FATCA Law”), the Senior Notes Issuer is likely to be treated as a Reporting Luxembourg Financial Institution. As such, the Senior Notes Issuer may require all holders of Senior Notes or their financial intermediary to provide documentary evidence of their tax residence and all other information deemed necessary to comply with the above mentioned regulations. This status includes the obligation for the Senior Notes Issuer to regularly obtain and verify information on all of its holders of Senior Notes. Upon request of the Senior Notes Issuer, each holder of Senior Notes shall agree to provide certain information, including, in case of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (“NFFE”), information on the Controlling Persons of such passive NFFE, along with the required supporting documentation. Similarly, each holder of Senior Notes shall agree to actively provide to the Senior Notes Issuer within thirty (30) days any information that would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address or a new residency address. The FATCA Law may result in the Senior Notes Issuer being obliged to disclose the name, address and taxpayer identification number (if available) of the holders of Senior Notes as well as information such as account balances, income and gross proceeds (non-exhaustive list) to the Luxembourg tax authorities for the purposes set out in the FATCA Law. Such information will be relayed by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the IRS.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises discretionary authority or control over the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to the assets of an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering whether to invest the assets of any Plan in a Note, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel to determine, among other things, whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing such Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to such Plan, including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control, conflict of interest and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations.

For example, an ERISA Plan is prohibited from lending money (or otherwise extending credit) to a party in interest or disqualified person, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and any fiduciary who authorizes such a transaction may be subject to personal liability, and any such transaction may need to be reversed or otherwise corrected. In addition, if the Plan involved in a non-exempt prohibited transaction is an IRA, the IRA could under certain circumstances lose its tax-exempt status. The acquisition and/or holding of a Note by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the initial purchasers are considered to be a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and holding of a Note depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Note and the relationship of the party in interest or the disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, relating to transactions effected by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, relating to investments by bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, relating to investments by life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23, relating to transactions directed by ----- in-house asset managers. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide exemptions for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person with respect to that ERISA Plan (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that, directly or indirectly, has or exercises discretionary authority or control, or renders investment advice with respect to, the ERISA Plan assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that, in connection with the transaction, the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to all possible prohibited transactions that might occur in connection with an ERISA Plan’s investment in the Notes or that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note (or any interest therein) that is an ERISA Plan will be further deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Notes, and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the potential excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may be imposed on persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing or holding a Note (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to such investment and whether an exemption would be necessary and applicable to an investment in a Note offered hereby. Each purchaser of a Note (or any interest therein) has the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase, holding and subsequent disposition of a Note offered hereby (or any interest therein), complies with the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes offered hereby to any Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Senior Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior Notes. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from each Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the Offering’s price for each series of Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United States-registered broker dealers. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they will do so only through one or more US registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable US law. In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that: - the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel; - during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 45 days after such date, none of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, BNP Paribas and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of or announce an intention to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided hereunder, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers or any of their respective subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes (other than the Notes); and - each Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of each Issuer may purchase a portion of the Notes in the Offering. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40-day period, neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer ----- _Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the_ Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market-making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate-covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate-covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the fourth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+4 ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next successive business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+4, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to each Issuer or the Guarantors. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by any of the Issuers or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors.” Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to the Issuers or the Guarantors, as applicable, in the past and received fees in relation to arranging such loans. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for each Issuer and its affiliates, as applicable, and may have from time to time in the past held, and may in the future hold, positions in our or any of our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general derivative transactions with us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses. In particular, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity ----- securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates, including the Notes. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing Senior Credit Facilities and thus may receive a portion of the proceeds from the Offering upon repayment thereof. In addition, Natixis and/or its respective affiliates is the facility agent and security agent under the Existing Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and will act as the facility agent under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their affiliates are expected to be lenders, arrangers or holder other roles under the New Senior Credit Facilities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of each Issuer, the group, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,64,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,64.1,European Union,64.1.1,EU Insolvency Regulation,"The Issuers and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Luxembourg, which are Member States of the European Union. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall apply only if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is, and will remain, located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. ----- If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States, so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, and to the preservation of ----- the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened, that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. Following the entry into force of the Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a company’s COMI has shifted in the preceding three months the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the opening of secondary proceedings in another EU Member State—which will no longer be limited only to “winding up proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has an establishment in such EU Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuers and the Guarantors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: (a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (i) insolvency practitioners and courts; (b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; (c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and (d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that: (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance; and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular, with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which: (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation; (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes); (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class; and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors, even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted, the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will, in particular, ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing, and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 1, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum one-year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. Although which proceedings will be affected by the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into French law has not yet been determined, it seems likely that safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings will be substantially amended to take into consideration the provisions of the Directive. The major differences between the Directive and current French insolvency law lie in: (a) the introduction of classes of creditors into French law based on a commonality of interests, as opposed to the current classification of creditors in accordance with the nature of their contractual relationship with the debtor and irrespective of their actual chances of repayment, i.e. as credit institutions, main suppliers or bondholders; and (b) the possibility to set up shareholders as one specific class when their rights may be impaired, allowing other classes of creditors to impose a plan on shareholders, which can only occur in very restrictive circumstances under current French law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In addition, any company of our Group having its center of main interests, within the meaning of the New Insolvency Regulation or, if not applicable, its COMI within the meaning of article R.600-1 of the French Commercial Code or an establishment in France, could also be subject to French court administered proceedings. Any company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State could be subject to French territorial insolvency proceedings. We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of either of any member of the Group (such as French Guarantor or Issuer) is in France (to the extent, however, that its center of main interests, within the meaning of EU Insolvency Regulation, is not in another jurisdiction), it could be subject to French proceedings affecting creditors including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or _conciliation proceedings) and court-administered proceedings being either safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial_ safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (procedure de redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (procedure de liquidation judiciaire). In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main center of interests within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code or an establishment in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings. Any company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State could be subject to French territorial insolvency proceedings. Specialized courts exist for: (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in turnover; (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation; or (iii) in cases where the EU Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts. In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our Group having its COMI in France would be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. ----- The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes. Such proceedings will likely be amended in the context of the transposition of the Restructuring Directive into French law with respect to which French statute n°2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 (“Loi Pacte”) grants the French government twenty-four months to enact appropriate measures through ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In particular, until December 31 2021, pursuant to article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020, in force as from November 26, 2020, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation proceedings may be extended one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a maximum of 10 months (see “—Conciliation Proceedings”). In addition, article 124 of Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020 extends until December 31, 2021, the following measures that were initially adopted by Ordinance n°2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, in force as from May 21, 2020 that were due to expire on December 31, 2020: - additional specific measures aimed at protecting debtors and an adaptation of the provisions governing grace periods in the context of conciliation proceedings (see “—Conciliation _Proceedings” and “—Grace Periods”);_ - the loosening of the conditions for eligibility to Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings and Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings (see “—Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings”); - the supervising judge’s right, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’ representative, to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement proposal the deadline during which creditors can respond to a debt settlement proposal in the context of a standard consultation for the approval of a safeguard or reorganization plan (see “—Adoption of the Safeguard or Reorganization Plan”); - the possible up to two-year extension of the duration of the safeguard or reorganization plan, as a result of which such a plan can now last up to 12 years (see “—Adoption of the Safeguard _or Reorganization Plan”); and_ - the grant of a special privilege for creditors that make new cash contributions to the debtor during the observation period in order to ensure the continuation of the company’s business and its survival, and for those who undertake to make such contribution for the execution of the safeguard or reorganization plan ordered or modified by the court (the “S/R Lien”). ----- Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may be put in place within the following weeks or months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years, the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published annually by decree by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. When the debtor benefits from a conciliation proceeding, these statutory provisions shall be read in combination with Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, pursuant to which the judge may impose grace periods on creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted Proceedings”).",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

These proceedings are confidential. The third party is appointed by the President of the competent commercial court upon proposal of the debtor company, but the discussions themselves are conducted outside the court; and - court-administered proceedings (procédures collectives), which are proceedings, during which payments by the debtor and legal actions by the creditors are suspended (automatic stay). These proceedings are public and involve all creditors (except for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as discussed below). Within this second category, French law further distinguishes between: - safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, which are voluntary proceedings and available to debtors that are facing difficulties they cannot overcome, but that are not insolvent (as defined below); and - judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, which are mandatory proceedings and must be opened by debtors that are insolvent.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties (economic or financial) but are not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court and do not automatically involve any stay of the claims or pending proceedings. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors but cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. Any agreement between the debtor and its main creditors (if any) will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings, and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims, but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. The ordinance of the court appointing the Mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for informational purposes to the debtor’s auditors. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of_ a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above), or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). Pursuant to article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated 25 November 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force as from 26 November 2020, until December 31, 2021, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of the conciliation proceedings may be extended, one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court up to a maximum of 10 months. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. _Conciliation proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure to statutory auditors if any and subject to the_ below) and may last up to five months, and do not automatically stay any pending proceedings, and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims, but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period, in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 of May 20, 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020 ----- 1443 of November 25, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, have modified conciliation proceedings to provide that, until December 31, 2021: (a) the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator, thereby increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of five months previously); (b) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings: (c) the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment default; (d) the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor; (e) the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim; or (f) the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—France—Grace periods” above) even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation. Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened if: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern; and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition: - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential, except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court; - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) ----- (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate); - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test” above), and, therefore, the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below, see “—The “hardening period” _(période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by_ the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force: - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained above; and - a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement, as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case, the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors that is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below. In the event of the commencement of subsequent safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, within the context of the adoption of a safeguard plan or a recovery plan, the court will not be able to impose a payment deferral to a date later than the date on which the plan is adopted, or debt reductions, to creditors with respect to their claims benefiting from the New Money Lien. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor. ----- As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end, or_ (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, for the portion that would exceed three-quarters of the total fees of the professional advisors retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor; in particular, it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at_ which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de _surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance) and to_ prepare a safeguard plan for the company, all under the supervision of the court. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_ representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors committee and, if any, the bondholders general meeting (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: - the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor or on its own initiative and in all such cases with the exception of (i) (b) above where: - the court may act upon its own initiative; and - the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor may only act in the event that no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors committee and, if any, the bondholders general meeting (as described below); - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. ----- Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, modified safeguard proceedings to provide that: - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings, a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created (the “S/R Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The S/R Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted, with the approval of the bankruptcy judge, after commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period. - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person: - during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge, or - or the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts. - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. - Such claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are required to declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the debts that arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings (as well as the post-proceedings commencement non-privileged debts) and are prohibited from engaging individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment default in relation to such debts and the accrual of interest on loans with a term of less than one year, or on payments deferred for less than one year, is stopped. Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’ ordinary activities during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien). The manner in which the liabilities will be settled as provided for in the plan (debt remissions and payment terms) must be submitted to the creditors during a consultation, or if rejected on an individual basis, prior to the plan being approved by the court. Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor_ or prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less unless, upon their or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below). ----- In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Pursuant to article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 until December 31, 2021, the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses. Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors consulted in writing that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until December 31, 2021, the abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the court-appointed creditors’ representative. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that_ were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-forequity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the total amount of the debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the specific rules in order to ensure that the full amount of the claim is repaid within the 10 year period. _Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory_ auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditor committees that are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (or their successors) (the “credit institutions committee”); and - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”). ----- If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations. As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or general meeting. It is unclear whether the Security Agent as creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Intercreditor Agreement would vote in the creditor’s committee. The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan. The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the courtappointed administrator. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject ----- it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the court empowers the administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting to take corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s share capital required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general bondholders meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the State prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. _Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security_ and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions to examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de _Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief_ may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those: - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or - whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and who have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding applicable taxes) or (iii) whose total balance sheet assets exceeds €1.5 million. However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020 1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision in order for the debtor to be eligible to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. ----- To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de _sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee,_ but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “—committee-based _consultation”)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated_ safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). In particular, the creditors committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the ----- creditors representative or the public prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings shall be drawn up by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see “—Status of Creditors _during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”)._",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire), a controller, the State prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial_ reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Under the judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator appointed by the court will assist the debtor to make management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). As a result of the commencement of liquidation proceedings, the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of the management. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission _d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to_ safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially with respect to committees of creditors, the bondholders general meeting and the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de _redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At_ any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. ----- In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—France - Court-administered Proceedings – _Safeguard”). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the_ shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, is determined by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; or - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: ----- - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or - request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business. The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court, such as: - automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside by the court if a claimant (such as an insolvency officer or the public prosecutor) so requests. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts (including a security to secure a guarantee obligation) previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration _d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code._ ----- - transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike with respect to void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Nor are “contractual _provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance_ with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and _provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other_ terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the sale plan (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), _provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one,_ the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or, during the observation period, against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard or ----- judicial reorganization proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation; - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan _de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”)._ In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings or the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings respectively (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors representative, are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings however, debts owed to creditors other than banks, financial institutions or bondholders should be paid in the ordinary course, and the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Those financial creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (but who would belong to the financial institutions’ committee or the bondholders general meeting) would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. ----- If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of managing the debtor, selling the assets of the debtor and settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where the sale of the business is considered, the court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business operations (see above) and organize the sale of the business process. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset. As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor will be required. The mandataire judiciaire may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share capital.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. _Exceptional measures related to COVID-19 Epidemic_ In the context of COVID-19 epidemic and the state of health emergency and lock-down measures that have been imposed in France, it should be noted that recourse to court-assisted proceedings and court-administered proceedings has been more difficult during the lock-down period. Therefore, ordinance n°2020-341 of March 27, 2020, ordinance n°2020-596 of May 20, 2020 (as modified by article 124 of French law n°2020-1525 of December 7, 2020) and ordinance n°2020-1443 of November 25, 2020 (together, the “French COVID _Insolvency Ordinances”) temporarily adapt the procedures for dealing with businesses which are facing_ difficulties to take account of the conditions under which they are implemented during the sanitary emergency (état d’urgence sanitaire) and in the months following its cessation. In particular, it encourages the use of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation) and lengthens the timeframe for court-administered proceedings. The provisions of these ordinances are applicable until December 31, 2020, July 17, 2021 or December 31, 2021, as the case may be. _Enhanced information of the president of the commercial court for the prevention of company difficulties_ Under the early warning procedure (procedure d’alerte) provided for in articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3 of the French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal representative of the company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of the competent court of the inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this measure is to provide the president of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with information relating to the difficulties encountered by a company. These provisions are applicable until and including December 31, 2021. Enhanced information of the president of the commercial court for the prevention of company difficulties. Under the early warning procedure (procedure d’alerte) provided for in articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3 of the French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal representative of the company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of the competent court of the inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this measure is to provide the president of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with ----- information relating to the difficulties encountered by a company. These provisions are applicable until and including December 31, 2021. _Enhanced effectiveness of conciliation proceedings_ The French COVID-19 Insolvency Ordinances implement measures aimed at considerably enhancing the efficiency of conciliation proceedings. The duration of conciliation proceedings can be increased, at the request of the conciliator, once or several times, provided that the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings shall not exceed 10 months (instead of four months, extendable once for an additional period of 1 month, previously). Until December 31, 2021, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor in conciliation may apply to the president of the court which ordered the commencement of the procedure, in ex parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings: - to stay or prohibit any legal action by a creditor with a view to order the debtor to pay a sum of money or to terminate a contract for non-payment of a sum of money; - to stay or prohibit any enforcement proceedings by a creditor on both movable and immovable property, as well as any distribution proceedings which have not become fully effective prior to the application; and - to defer or reschedule creditors’ claims which are due and payable. These measures may be combined with the request for grace periods under Articles 1343-5 of the French Civil Codes, as already provided for in Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code. Even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation. These new provisions allow the implementation of a hybrid conciliation procedure, the effects of which are similar to those of safeguard proceedings but without the disadvantages. These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2021. _Provisions aimed at facilitating the use of accelerated proceedings_ The use of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) is facilitated, by removing the threshold conditions provided for in Article L. 628-1 of the French Commercial Code relating to the employees and turnover thresholds for the safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and the financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée). If the accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) fail and no plan is drawn up within the period provided for in the first paragraph of Article L. 628-8 of the French Commercial Code, the court may immediately, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator (administrateur judiciaire), the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor (ministere public), open separate judicial reorganization (procédure de redressement) or liquidation proceedings (procédure de liquidation judiciaire). The aim is to make these pre-pack proceedings available to as many companies as possible. These provisions are applicable to proceedings initiated between May 21, 2020 until the earlier of July 17, 2021 (inclusive) and the date of entry into force of the upcoming ordinance that will transpose under French law the requirements of EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 (i.e., the insolvency proceedings harmonization directive). ----- _Provisions to facilitate the adoption of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) or a judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement)_ The adoption of a safeguard or judicial reorganization plan is facilitated and accelerated by: - shortening the timelines for consulting creditors to 15 days in the event of the presentation of a draft plan at the request of the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the judicial administrator (administrateur judiciaire), with the authorization of the insolvency judge (juge _commissaire);_ - a reduction in the formalities for consulting creditors: proposals for the settlement of debts as well as any responses to these proposals may be communicated by any means enabling the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) to establish with certainty the date of their receipt; - the finalization of the plan exceptionally based on outstanding liabilities estimated on the basis of a certificate from the chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) or statutory auditor, on admitted, uncontested and identifiable claims (those for which the deadline for filing has not expired). These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings up to and including December 31, 2021. _Provisions aimed at facilitating the implementation of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) and a judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement)_ The Ordinance dated May 20, 2020 provides for provisions to facilitate the implementation of safeguard and judicial reorganization plans by: - increasing by a maximum of two years the duration of the execution of the safeguard or judicial reorganization plans (i.e. a maximum duration of 12 years or 17 years in the agricultural sector); - deeming failure to reply from creditors consulted for the adoption or modification of the plan to be acceptance of the proposed new payment terms; - introducing the S/R Lien, for persons who make a new cash contribution to the debtor either during the observation period, or within the framework of the safeguard or judicial reorganization plan (these new contributions will be mentioned in the judgment which adopts or modifies the plan). Creditors benefiting from this safeguard or judicial reorganization privilege are paid, for the amount of their contribution, in the order provided for in III of Article L. 622-17 and III of Article L. 641-13 of the French Commercial Code, i.e., after wage claims. Contributions granted by the shareholders and partners of the debtor in the context of a capital increase are excluded from the safeguard or judicial reorganization privilege. Such claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors. These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2021, with the exception of the provisions on the safeguard privilege applicable as from May 21, 2020 and at the latest until and including December 31, 2021. _Provisions to facilitate the sale of the business_ Adjustments relating to the sale of the business have been provided and in particular, a reduction in the notice period required to convene the contracting parties provided for in article R. 642-7 of the French Commercial Code from 15 to 8 days in the event of a plan for the sale of the business (this notice period may however be modified by decree pursuant to article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020). These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2020. _Provisions aimed at facilitating recovery of the company_ The period at the end of which the mention in the trade and company registry of safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings is deleted from the register if the plan is still in progress is reduced to one year (this ----- period may however be modified by decree pursuant to article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020).

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition and a contractual financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes (including any additional Notes) which the Issuers have (i) applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each French Guarantor and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor through the intercompany loans, cash pooling arrangements or similar arrangements that are outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor or (ii) used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to a French Guarantor or its controlled subsidiaries through the intercompany loans or similar arrangements and that are, in each case, outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could subordinate or declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder that represent either (i) the amount of debt made available directly or indirectly to that French Guarantor or its subsidiaries with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred by a holding company of such French Guarantor to the extent that such Indebtedness is or has been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of the Issuers constituting Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which term includes the Notes offered hereby; and (ii) the amounts of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French Guarantor, and the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees. The amount secured by any Collateral which is granted by any such French Guarantor (or any other guarantor which is incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the amount which it is so able to guarantee. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock ----- company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement _de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge_ will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers. _Parallel Debt_ Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code, (which will be the case here for the Security Documents governed by French law). The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes ----- Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). Although the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) has held (in a decision dated September 13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n° 10-25.533 Belvédère) rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the French law concept of international public policy (ordre public international), this decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral. Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that become particularly important following default or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. _Trustee_ Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture, and may therefore not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the French Tax Code and the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belvédère decision referred to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified The Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee. _Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French courts_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts. A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered. Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers convenus” (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the creation ----- of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as _tiers convenus and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking and the_ second or lower ranking secured parties. To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial securities account, and consequently, no assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event. _Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Pledges Over Receivables/Bank Accounts_ The pledges over receivables/bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over receivables/bank accounts. As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables/bank accounts of a company. Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank accounts from granting a second ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts, this structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Senior Secured Notes received with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

In addition to these Insolvency Proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Senior Notes to receive payment on the Senior Notes may be affected by a decision of the Commercial District Court (Tribunal d’arrondissement _siégeant en matière commerciale) granting suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) or putting the Senior_ Notes Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire).",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial (intuitu personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law, such as employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions purporting to terminate a contract upon bankruptcy are generally held as being valid. The receiver may choose to terminate contracts of the company subject to the rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus” and the creditors’ interest. Unsecured claims of the Senior Notes Issuer (such as the Senior Notes Issuer’s liabilities under the Senior Notes) will, in the event of a liquidation of the Senior Notes Issuer, only rank after (i) the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and (ii) the debts of the Senior Notes Issuer that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, inter alia: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. - For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realised and subject to application of the relevant priority rules, liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law). During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer are suspended. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Senior Notes Issuer during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by the Luxembourg court and dates back not more than six months as from the date on which the Luxembourg court formally adjudicates a company bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period. In particular: pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some transactions in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg act of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the Collateral Act 2005), the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from inception), transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside, if so requested by the bankruptcy receiver; pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to setting aside by the ----- Commercial District Court upon proceedings initiated by the bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; and pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Following such a request, the Commercial District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings in the event that the Senior Notes Issuer (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court considers that these conditions are met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by the Senior Notes Issuer or a creditor. If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy receivers (curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to supervise the bankruptcy proceedings. The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in the judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds. The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the Senior Notes Issuer in place of the managers. The bankruptcy receiver will realize the Senior Notes Issuer ’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the Senior Notes Issuer ’s creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the bankrupt company’s shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver represents the Senior Notes Issuer as well as the creditors collectively (masse des créanciers). ----- The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for certain acts, such as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the Senior Notes Issuer during the bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy is governed by public policy and rules, which generally delay the process and limit restructuring options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs. On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

An application for controlled management can only be made by the Senior Notes Issuer. The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test applied in bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criteria (that is, the case where a company is not in a position to completely fulfil its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the Senior Notes Issuer is taken. Controlled management proceedings is only available for good-faith debtor. Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not often successful and generally lead to bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in particular holding or finance companies, which are part of an international group and whose inability to meet obligations results from a default of group companies. The proceedings are divided into three steps: The Senior Notes Issuer must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court can reject the application because (i) the Senior Notes Issuer has already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the evidence brought forward by the Senior Notes Issuer does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of the Senior Notes Issuer’s business or improve the realization of the Senior Notes Issuer’s assets in better conditions. If the application is upheld at this stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an investigating judge (juge délégué) to make a report on the overall situation of the Senior Notes Issuer. Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may (i) turn down the application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are unlikely to lead to the reorganization of the business or the realization of the assets in better conditions or (ii) appoint one or more administrators (commissaires) who will supervise the management of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer. If the Commercial District Court ascertains that the Senior Notes Issuer is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. the Senior Notes Issuer has ceased its payments (cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have been in such situation. Such date may be set up to six months prior to the filing of application for controlled management proceedings. However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the two conditions for bankruptcy are met (cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either before or after consideration of the report by the investigating judge or after the reorganization plan proposed by the administrators (commissaires) at the third step described below. The administrators will draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the financial situation of the Senior Notes Issuer. They are also in charge of the annual accounts of the Senior Notes Issuer. The administrators may also prescribe any act they consider to be in the interests of the applicant or its creditors. The administrators have to be convened to any meeting of the board of managers. They may attend all board meetings but have no voting rights. They have the right to convene such board meetings. The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a plan for realization of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court. The plan shall equitably take into account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking of mortgages (hypothèques) and privileges (privilèges) as required by law, without taking into account any contractual clause regarding termination, penalties or acceleration. The administrators will notify the draft plan to the creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. Within fifteen days of such notification or publication, the creditors will inform the Commercial District Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any creditor who abstains will be considered as having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the joint debtors and the guarantors may submit written ----- observations to the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court may (i) approve the plan if a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the Senior Notes Issuer ’s liabilities have agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed by the administrators even though a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed to such plan, in which case the application for controlled management will be dismissed or (iii) ask the administrators to propose an amended plan (such amended plan will have to be submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving the plan will be binding upon the company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the administrators will be fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The administrators who at the same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The Senior Notes Issuer may not enter into any act of disposition, mortgage and contract or accept any movable asset without the authorization of the investigating judge. Once the administrators have been appointed, the Senior Notes Issuer may not carry out any act (including receiving funds, lending money, granting any security, or making any payment) without the prior authorization of the administrators. The administrators may bring any action before the Commercial District Court in order to have any act made in violation of the legislation governing the controlled management or in fraud of the creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to the prior authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may bring an action (i) to have the managers or the statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District Court has declared the company to be in cessation of payments, to have certain payments, compensations or security interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth in Articles 445 et seq. of the Luxembourg code of commerce).",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Preventive composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial difficulty. Similar to controlled management proceedings, the preventive composition proceedings are not available if the company has already been declared bankrupt by the Commercial District Court or if the company is acting in bad faith. The application for the preventive composition proceedings can only be made by the Senior Notes Issuer and must be supported by proposals of preventive composition. The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to verify, and to prepare a report on, the situation of the Senior Notes Issuer. Based on such report, the Commercial District Court will decide whether or not to pursue the preventive composition proceedings. If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure should not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of the company (which bankruptcy may also be declared during the preventive composition proceedings if the conditions for the composition proceedings are not met). If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour of a meeting (assemblée concordataire) at which the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will make its report at the assemblée concordataire. The preventive composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by their unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the Senior Notes Issuer ’s debt, has adhered to the proposal and if the preventive composition has been homologated by the Commercial District Court. Creditors benefiting from mortgages (hypothèques), privileges (privilèges) or pledges (gages) only have a deliberating voice in the operations of the concordat, if they renounce the benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in favor of the concordat entails renunciation. The renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a portion (but representing at least 50% in value) of their claims with corresponding voting rights. ----- The preventive composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a pledge and on claims by the tax authorities. If the application results in a preventive composition arrangement sanctioned by the Commercial District Court, the preventive composition could still either be annulled (if it has not been executed) or terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of the company). In such scenarios, the Commercial District Court may adjudicate bankrupt the Senior Notes Issuer. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the date of cessation of payment to the date of the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that date is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy judgment, the court can of course set the cessation of payment date at six months prior to its judgment.

It can only be applied to a company which,_ as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts. The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)). The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has lost its attractiveness.

The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company,” which is a translation of the French “intérêt social,” an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior.” Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. The concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of Luxembourg act of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the Companies Law 1915). The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the security provider concerned. The security interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him / her. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null and void. The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. _Creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests_ According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the security interests (such as a pledge) are situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of pledges over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors ----- located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over bank accounts located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of pledges depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties; - sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares) or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges might be substantially delayed. The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges and transfer of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganisation affecting any one of the parties. The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending on the type of security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral takers, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of such financial collateral, persons acting on behalf of the third-party beneficiaries of a financial collateral, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of a financial collateral under the Collateral Act 2005. _Recognition of foreign law governed security interests_ Foreign law-governed security interests (such as the Shared Collateral which are governed by French law) and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as ----- defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/ arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the relevant Luxembourg security provider becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets. However, in accordance with article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005, where a pledgor (constituant) under a financial collateral arrangement is established or resides in Luxembourg, Luxembourg law provisions (including claw-back provisions) relating to reorganization measures, liquidation proceedings, other situations of competition between creditors are not applicable. Article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 applies to (i) Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements and (ii) any “similar” foreign law collateral arrangement, to the extent that it covers assets (avoirs) within the meaning of the Collateral Act 2005, i.e. (i) financial instruments and (ii) claims (together, the Collateral Act 2005 Assets), to the exclusion of any other rights or assets. To determine if a foreign law governed collateral arrangement could be considered (for the purposes of article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005) as a “similar” collateral arrangement (i.e. similar to a Luxembourg law governed collateral arrangement governed by the Collateral Act 2005), a Luxembourg court (if having jurisdiction) might, presumably, analyze elements, such as, the main features and effects of such foreign law governed collateral arrangement taking into account, notably, the scope and type of security (e.g., fixed charge, floating charge), the nature of the security assets (i.e. whether or not they consist in Collateral Act 2005 Assets), the type of rights created in favor of a creditor (e.g., personal guarantee or right in rem) and whether a similar type of security interest may exist under Luxembourg law. Should a Luxembourg judge come to the conclusion that a foreign law governed collateral constitutes a “similar” collateral arrangement (within the meaning of article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005), such foreign law governed collateral arrangement would benefit from the abovementioned protection under article 24 of the Collateral Act 2005 insofar Collateral Act 2005 Assets are concerned. In a European cross-border insolvency context, paragraph 1 of article 8 of the European Insolvency Regulation, pursuant to which the opening of insolvency proceedings shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets - both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time - belonging to the debtor which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings, should be binding upon Luxembourg insolvency courts. Subject to certain exceptions (provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation), in the scenario where (i) main insolvency proceedings (within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) would be opened against the Senior Notes Issuer in Luxembourg and (ii) the assets over which security is granted under and pursuant to the foreign security agreements would be located or deemed to be located within the territory of a Member State (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) other than Luxembourg, the opening of such main proceedings against the Senior Notes Issuer in Luxembourg should not affect the rights in rem of the creditors in respect of assets of the Senior Issuer over which security is granted under and pursuant to the foreign security agreements, in accordance with the above-mentioned paragraph 1 of article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The registration of the Senior Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indentures, the Senior Note Guarantees, Trustee’s accession deed to the Intercreditor Agreement and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) (the “Documents”) is required if such Documents are either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire). In such cases, as well as in case of a voluntary ----- registration, the Documents will be subject to registration duties payable by the party registering, or being ordered to register, the Documents. Depending on the nature of the Documents, such registration duties would be ad valorem (such as for instance a registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts mentioned in those agreements) or fixed (such as for instance a registration duty of €12 for a pledge). No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005.

130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.1,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES France,27.1.1,,"Each Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of France with its registered offices or principal places of business in France. The directors, officers and other executives of each Issuer are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of each Issuer or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of US courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of US federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against each Issuer, each French Guarantor and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such US judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such US judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such US judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the US court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such US judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such US judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such US judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the US judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such US judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the US judgment will benefit from the res _judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in_ France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative US action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the US authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. ----- Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative US action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of US federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772
130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.2,Luxembourg,27.2.1,,"We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any US Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the US securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a US court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the US judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the US judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the US judgment is enforceable (executoire) in the United States; - the US court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the applicable matter under applicable US Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the US court is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; the US court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules according to certain Luxembourg case law, it is admitted that Luxembourg courts which are asked to grant an exequatur do not have to verify whether the substantive law actually applied by the US court awarding the judgment was the law which would have been thus designated; - the US judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg; ----- - the US court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the US judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and - the US judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi _luxembourgeoise)._ Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future. Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although such a review is not statutorily prohibited. We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not bona fide or if the foreign law was not pleaded or proved or if pleaded and proved, the foreign law was contrary to Luxembourg mandatory provisions (lois impératives) or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules, and (ii) if its application is manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of US federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

External growth investments (acquisitions) The Group continued to pursue acquisition-led growth in the year, consolidating 75 new companies as a result of its acquisitions (versus 65 at 31 December 2019). The companies acquired were mainly French or international companies engaged in property administration (administration de biens, hereafter referred to as property management), with the exception of Yxime, which is active on the property management market. None of these acquisitions are subject to any specific contingent consideration or earn-out clauses. The year’s most important acquisitions concerned the four companies described below. ➢ Acquisitions of companies consolidated in the year ▪ Yxime: On 9 July 2020, Esset Management finalized its acquisition of the entire share capital of Yxime SAS from the Duval group, for a total purchase consideration of €24.2 million. This business combination is consistent with Esset’s strategy of strengthening its foothold on the property management market, and particularly the management of tertiary real estate, and of consolidating its regional network. Together, Yxime and Esset are France’s leading property management firm, managing 11 million square metres of tertiary real estate and 20,000 residential lots. The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of this acquisition was still in progress at 31 December 2020. Provisional goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition amounted to €27.1 million at 31 December 2020. ▪ Gérance de Passy: On 21 July 2020, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Gérance de Passy and Sofigest, for a total purchase consideration of €20 million. Founded in 1898, Gérance de Passy is a major player on the Parisian property management market, specialising in the city’s historical upscale 16th arrondissement. Building on its reputation and high-end clientele, the Gérance de Passy group has also successfully moved into managing properties in other arrondissements of the French capital and in nearby towns and cities. Today, the group manages a portfolio of more than 2,700 rented lots and has more than 720 jointly owned properties. Gérance de Passy had revenue of €10.2 million in 2019. |Analysis of scope of consolidation at 31 December 2020 31 Dec. 2020 31 Dec. 2019 Full consolidation 293 239 Of which acquisitions 64 Of which newly created companies 3 Of which disposals during the period ( 1) ( 1) Of which mergers and asset contributions (“TUP”) 12 ( 2) Equity method 1 1 Total – France 294 240 Full consolidation 55 44 Of which acquisitions during the period 11 Of which formations during the period 2 Of which mergers and asset contributions (“TUP”) ( 2) Total – International 55 44 Total – Consolidated entities 349 284|Change 54 64 3 ( 1) ( 12) 54 11| |---|---| ||11 2 ( 2) 11 65| ----- ###### This acquisition allows the Group to develop its presence on the premium segment, which offers attractive opportunities provided that the Group’s commercial and marketing positioning can be adapted to meet the specific needs of this clientele. Two new companies were created in connection with this acquisition: Stares group (held by Foncia Groupe) and Stares France (held by Stares group), into which the Group made a capital investment of €15.3 million. The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of this acquisition was still in progress at 31 December 2020. Provisional goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition amounted to €21.7 million at 31 December 2020. ➢ Acquisitions of companies carried out late in 2020 and not consolidated in the year ▪ Loft One: On 31 December 2020, Foncia Toulouse completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of the Loft One group for a provisional purchase consideration of €27.7 million. Loft One is among the leading property management companies in south-west France, managing 14,062 rental properties and 38,734 jointly owned properties. This acquisition placed the Group as leader on the local market. ▪ Office des Propriétaires (Belgium): On 11 December 2020, through Stares Orange (its subsidiary created for this purpose), the Group acquired the entire share capital of Office des Propriétaires (OP) along with a 45% stake in OP Property Management (the remaining shares are indirectly held by OP) for a total purchase consideration of €14.5 million. This combination between the Trévi group and Office des Propriétaires will enable the Group to become the leading property services company in Belgium. The acquisition therefore marks a further step in the Group’s acquisition-led growth strategy and its aim to become a leading player on the property services market across Europe. Already the foremost player in France and Switzerland, Foncia is also looking for opportunities that will allow it to step up its growth in Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. The two companies acquired were not consolidated at 31 December 2020. The acquisition value of the companies is shown within non-consolidated investments (see Note 4.5).

The measures taken by governments to stem the spread of the virus had a far-reaching impact on the Group’s operating activities during the year. In particular, in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all Foncia Group premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public and to employees for much of the year. This directly impacted the Group’s revenue, margins and operating cash flows. The health restrictions limited activities relating to the transactions and lettings businesses, as well as incidental fees earned on jointly owned properties within and outside France. Despite these difficulties, all of the Group’s businesses managed to continue operating. As from the very outset of the crisis, the Group put in place a series of measures to ensure that it could continue to conduct its business and to protect the health of its employees (and clients) in compliance with government requirements: ✓ From a human resources and organisational perspective, homeworking was systematically introduced for all ###### employees whose work could be performed from home and who had the necessary tools available. ✓ From a financial management perspective, the Group swiftly took measures to cut costs and also reviewed its ###### investment programmes. These measures included:  keeping a close watch on service performance, freezing non-strategic investments and discontinuing any temporary employment contracts not deemed necessary to conduct the Group’s essential business;   maintaining a tight rein on administrative expenses. In this context, the Group incurred total costs of €1.8 million (sanitizing gels, masks, etc.) in the period to protect its employees, which were recorded within non-recurring operating items. Within the scope of exceptional tax measures introduced by the French government, the Group also requested the earlier refund of its tax receivables and adopted several short-time working arrangements allowed by the government in France and in Switzerland: ✓ In France, 2,419 employees were furloughed, primarily in the transactions, digital, and rental management businesses. Compensation for furlough schemes represented €6.1 million in the year.  ✓ In Switzerland, the Group was eligible for the Reduced Working Hours scheme (“RHT”), which allowed it to reduce or interrupt the working time of affected employees. Unemployment insurance covers 80% of the time not worked, thereby helping to avoid a loss in income for those concerned. Compensation for this measure represented CHF 1.3 million (€1.2 million) in the year. Aid received in respect of short-time working arrangements is treated as an operating subsidy within the meaning of IAS 20 and recognised as a deduction from personnel costs (see Note 5.5). In order to safeguard its independence, the Group did not apply for any government-backed loan (with the exception of the €1.4 million loan granted to its subsidiary Efficity, repaid in December 2020), and made all of its tax, social and operating payments as they fell due. In the context of the crisis, the Group reviewed the assumptions and estimates which were used as a basis for measuring certain statement of financial position and profit and loss items. As a result, it updated the financial forecasting assumptions for its CGUs which are used as the basis for its impairment tests. No impairment was recognised against the Group’s assets as a result of these tests. Note 4.1.2 provides more details on the impairment testing approach. ----- ###### Partial repayment of the shareholder loan On 13 November 2020, the Group repaid €16 million of its shareholder loan. Follow-up on the accounting treatment adopted for the Leemo/Primonial partial asset transfer By way of reminder, on 30 November 2018 Primonial acquired a 40% equity interest in Leemo (a wholly-owned Foncia subsidiary) via a partial asset transfer consisting of Primonial’s entire, stand-alone sales brokerage division for new and existing properties. Leemo issued a total of 33,624 preferred shares to Primonial as consideration for this transfer. Pursuant to IAS 32, since the basis on which the shares issued could be converted did not represent a fixed basis, the shares did not meet the definition of an equity instrument. Accordingly, they were classified within financial liabilities by default and included within non-current borrowings and debt for €7 million. Until the preferred shares are converted into ordinary shares, they are considered financial liabilities to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with any changes in fair value taken to profit or loss. The fair value of the preferred shares is based on both the estimated value of Leemo and on the expected conversion ratio. The Group is therefore required to assess the convertibility (conversion ratio) for these preferred shares in 2021 based on data for 2020, which depends on changes in the respective contributions of the Foncia Group and Primonial to Leemo’s net revenue. The conversion ratio will be estimated in line with changes in the business contributed by both groups. In the event of an outperformance, Primonial could increase its interest in Leemo to 49%, or a maximum of 48,457 shares, via the transfer of additional ordinary Leemo shares. In the event of an underperformance, the Foncia Group would be eligible for cash compensation of up to €2 million and the shares would be converted at a rate of one ordinary share for one preferred share. Median scenarios also assume different conversion rates that could lead Primonial to hold between 40% and 49% of Leemo’s ordinary shares after the preferred shares have been converted. Based on 2020 revenue figures, Leemo’s performance was favourable to the Foncia Group and (once the financial statements have been approved in 2021), the Group can therefore consider that (i) the preferred shares will be converted at a rate of one preferred share to one ordinary share, and (ii) the Primonial group will be liable to pay the Foncia Group cash compensation of €2 million. On this basis, the €7 million financial liability was reduced to zero against an income entry within non-recurring operating items for €7 million, with €2 million in non-recurring accrued income recognised in respect of the compensation receivable from Primonial. In light of the level of business recorded following the transfer of the division by Primonial, the value of the client relationship was written down in full against a non-recurring expense in an amount of €7 million. NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS General principles used to prepare the financial statements The accounting policies described in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the amendments adopted as described in Note 3.2.3, effective as of 1 January 2020. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for assets held for sale and related liabilities, measured in accordance with IFRS 5, and certain financial instruments carried at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9. The consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management at 31 December 2020 were adopted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting held on 2 March 2021, and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the General Meeting on 23 March 2021. ----- ###### They are presented in thousands of euros and amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest thousand unless otherwise specified. Consequently, the sum of these amounts may differ slightly from the total amounts reported. Accounting standards 3.2.1. Application of the IFRIC IC’s final agenda decision on the term of certain leases In its 2019 financial statements, the Group had not finalised the analyses and modifications necessary to implement the IFRS IC’s November 2019 agenda decision on IFRS 16 lease terms. As a result, it had adopted a legal approach when calculating the enforceable term of its property leases, as permitted by the AMF in its recommendations for companies preparing their 2019 financial statements. The IFRS IC agenda decision provides clarification when calculating lease terms and applies to commercial leases in France among others: ➢ It reiterates that the lease term used to measure lease liabilities is understood as the enforceable period of the lease, since a lease is no longer enforceable when the lessee and lessor are each entitled to terminate the lease without the consent of the other party and without incurring “no more than an insignificant” penalty. Consequently, the lessor’s unilateral right to terminate the lease is not sufficient to determine the enforceable term of the lease. ➢ It also clarifies that in order to determine the enforceable period of a lease and assess whether a penalty is “no more than insignificant” within the meaning of IFRS 16.B34, companies should consider the broader economics of the lease contract and not only contractual termination payments. The notion of a penalty must therefore include all economic incentives not to terminate the lease. In its decision, the IFRS IC also reiterates that the lease term used to measure the lease liability must be consistent with the useful life adopted for non-removable leasehold improvements. On 3 July 2020, the Board of the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables – ANC) published a new position statement on calculating the term of “3-6-9”-type commercial leases in France. This new statement supersedes the statement issued on 16 February 2018. In this revised statement, the ANC concludes that the lease term should reflect the term during which the lessee is reasonably certain to continue the lease, and that when the legal term of the lease is nine years, the term of the lease is “generally nine years at inception”. On this basis, the Group launched a project in 2020 to review (and re-estimate, where appropriate) the terms of its property leases in light of the IFRS IC’s decision and the ANC’s revised position statement. This project led the Group to increase the lease term for its automatically renewable property leases in France to three years due to (i) the need for the business to continue operating which acts as an incentive to continue the initial lease, but also to (ii) the Group’s strongly proactive and opportunistic real estate strategy in streamlining its property portfolio (notably during restructuring operations resulting from its acquisitions). By way of reminder, the Group had adopted the legally defensible term of a lease in its 2019 financial statements, i.e., nine months at the date of first-time application of IFRS 16 (1 January 2019) and six months at the 31 December 2019 reporting date. Based on analyses performed by the Group of its other categories of leased assets, it did not identify the need to revise the lease terms. This is because the enforceable term of these other leases is generally aligned with the IFRS 16 lease term, since the economic penalties that would be incurred if the lease were to be terminated are insignificant or non-existent. ----- ###### In accordance with IAS 8 and in the absence of any transitional provisions to the contrary, any changes resulting from a final agenda decision issued by the IFRS IC are retrospectively applicable. Accordingly, the impacts of modifying lease terms as a direct result of applying the IFRS IC’s agenda decision were recognized in the statement of financial position with retroactive effect from:  the date of first-time application of IFRS 16 (1 January 2019) for leases in progress at that date;  the inception of the lease for new leases, or the date of modification for leases modified after 1 January 2019. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 were also restated retrospectively to reflect the application of this decision. These restatements are referred to throughout this document as “2019 (restated)”.

Basis of preparation of financial information Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 297/2008 of 11 March 2008, the 2020 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at the reporting date. Information for the comparative period was prepared in accordance with the same accounting policies.  The full text of the standards adopted by the European Union can be consulted on the European Commission’s website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting_en Where there is no specific guidance from IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations, the Group refers to other IFRS standards dealing with similar issues or to the Conceptual Framework, in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. At the end of the reporting period, there was no difference between the IFRS used to prepare these financial statements and the standards adopted by the IASB and applicable for the period presented. The Group does not apply IFRS standards that had not yet been adopted by the European Union at the reporting date. It chose not to early adopt the standards, amendments and interpretations not mandatorily applicable at the reporting date. The accounting policies and bases of measurement applied to prepare these consolidated financial statements are described in Note 3.4 below. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Foncia Management, the entities it controls (subsidiaries) and the entities which are accounted for by the equity method. The financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared over the same period as those of the parent company, i.e., 1 January to 31 December 2020, using consistent accounting policies. |Impact of IFRS 16 on the statement of profit and loss 2019 IFRS 16 (€ thousands) (presented) restatement Restatement of rent on premises 36,605 Restatement of rent-free periods ( 789) Restatement of rent on the vehicle fleet 2,789 Neutralisation of provision for reconditioning (Arval) 254 Restatement of rent on printers 1,186 Other rent restatements 82 Depreciation of right-of-use assets ( 40,403) 230 Impact on consolidated recurring operating profit (loss) ( 276) 230 Neutralisation of non-recurring rental expenses on property leases 2,359 Net impact of lease terminations and reductions in the lease scope ( 72) Impact on consolidated non-recurring operating items 2,287 Interest on lease liabilities ( 3,905) ( 294) Impact on consolidated net profit (loss) before tax ( 1,894) ( 64)|2019 (restated) 36,605 ( 789) 2,789 254 1,186 82 ( 40,173) ( 46) ( 72)| |---|---| ||2,287| ||( 4,199) ( 1,958)| ----- ###### 3.2.3.

The Group is currently analysing the potential impacts of applying the requirements set out in these texts for the first time. ----- ###### 3.2.4. Use of management estimates in applying the Group’s accounting standards In preparing its financial statements, the Group is required to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the measurement and presentation of certain assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given the current circumstances. These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. The uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 health crisis has increased the significance of the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the 2020 financial statements. Where appropriate, the Group carried out sensitivity analyses on its key estimates, details of which are reported in the notes concerned. The estimates made by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. ▪ Recoverable amount of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Note 4.1.2 sets out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same note. ▪ Measurement of leases IFRS 16 requires entities to use certain key estimates, which include:  whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised;  the lease term;  the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments;  the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the contract. The main assumptions used by the Group to prepare its 2020 financial statements are described in Note 4.4.3. ▪ Measurement of assets and liabilities relating to post-employment plans The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. Note 4.12 sets out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. ▪ Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount. ----- ###### In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, the Group uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements:  present a true and fair view of Foncia Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows;  reflect the economic substance of transactions;  are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects. Detailed disclosures in this regard are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Basis of measurement 3.3.1. Basis of consolidation Details of the main consolidated companies at 31 December 2020 are provided in Note 13 “Scope of consolidation”. Controlled entities Companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group is exposed to risks or is entitled to variable returns from its involvement with the entity in question and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Control is analysed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the inputs used to assess control has changed. A subsidiary is consolidated as from the date control is acquired, which is usually upon signature of the share transfer and disposal agreements (see “Accounting for ongoing acquisitions” below). Consolidation ceases when control is relinquished. Any interest in the subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recognised within non-controlling interests. Profits and losses and each component of other comprehensive income relating to subsidiaries are allocated to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Changes in the percentage interest held in subsidiaries that do not lead to a change in control are treated as equity transactions, since the transactions take place between owners acting in their capacity as owners. The impact of these transactions is shown in equity net of tax and does not therefore impact consolidated profit or loss. These transactions are also shown in the statement of cash flows under cash flows relating to investing activities. Investments in equity-accounted companies (associates and joint ventures) Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s interest in the profits, losses and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. ----- ###### IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures is applied in order to determine whether the Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures need to be tested for impairment. Where necessary, the total carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets. Acquisitions in progress or carried out late in the year Before acquiring shares in a property management company, the Group agrees to acquire the shares and typically pays 10% of the estimated price to the seller. This part payment is included in “Downpayments on acquisitions of securities” within non-current financial assets (see Note 4.5). The remaining 90% is booked under off-balance sheet commitments (see Note 9). Note that at this point in the transaction, the Group does not yet have control over the entity being acquired. Upon signing the share transfer or disposal agreement, the Group pays an additional 70% of the estimated price to the seller. The provisional purchase price is then included in equity investments, and the part payment already recognised is also reclassified to this caption. The acquired company is then consolidated. Following a review of the acquired company’s financial statements, the Group pays the remaining balance and adjusts the purchase price of the shares. In the case of acquisitions completed late in the year (generally in November or December), even though the acquired companies may be controlled by the Group, they are not consolidated until the following year, due to insufficient accounting information being available. The investment made is therefore temporarily carried in non-current financial assets at its acquisition cost (i.e., representing the fair value of the investment). The shares are included in “Investments in controlled companies pending consolidation” (see Note 4.5.). No other statement of financial position or profit and loss item is recorded. Non-consolidated investments Companies with the following characteristics are not included in the scope of consolidation: ▪ they are in the process of being wound up or are dormant; ▪ their business is not strategic for the Group. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-consolidated investments are carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. There are no material obligations or liabilities relating to these entities. 3.3.2. Elimination of intragroup transactions All intragroup transactions and balances as well as any income, expenses, gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions and included in the carrying amount of assets are eliminated on consolidation. When a Group entity carries out a transaction with a joint venture or associate, the related gains and losses are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the interests held by third parties in the joint venture or associate. Foreign currency translation Presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Functional currency and translation of the financial statements of foreign companies A consolidated entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the local currency. However, certain entities must adopt a functional currency ----- ###### other than their local currency when that currency represents the currency of the major transactions carried out by the entity and accurately reflects its economic environment. The financial statements of foreign entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are translated using the “closing rate” method, as follows: ▪ assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate; ▪ statement of profit and loss and cash flow items are converted at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting currency translation differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income within equity under “Translation adjustments”. Goodwill relating to foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro are treated as assets acquired or liabilities assumed and therefore translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. As the Group does most of its business in the eurozone, only its Swiss subsidiaries prepare financial statements in a currency other than the euro. The following exchange rates were used to prepare the consolidated financial statements: 2020 2019 Equivalent to €1 Closing rate Average rate Opening rate Closing rate Average rate Opening rate CHF (Swiss Franc) 1.0802 1.0705 1.0952 1.0952 1.1138 1.1295 ###### The exchange rates used are the rates published by the Banque de France. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedged rate. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the closing exchange rate, with the resulting gains and losses included in foreign exchange gains and losses under other financial income and expenses in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined. Loans granted to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in that foreign operation. Translation adjustments arising on monetary items that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (equity) under “Foreign currency translation reserves”, and taken to profit or loss when the net investment is sold. 3.4.1. Business combinations and goodwill The Group uses the purchase method to account for its acquisitions of subsidiaries. The fair value of the consideration transferred reflects the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed or incurred by the acquirer at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed in the period in which they were incurred. On the first-time consolidation of a subsidiary or equity investment, the Group measures all identifiable items acquired at their acquisition-date fair value. The items are measured in the currency of the acquired company. In the event of ----- ###### deferred settlements, the future amounts payable are discounted to present value at the settlement date. The discount rate used is the same as that used to estimate the value of the assets. Fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities resulting from business combinations accounted for on a provisional basis (i.e., because the independent appraisals or ongoing additional analyses are incomplete) are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within 12 months of the acquisition (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Adjustments made after the measurement period are taken directly to profit or loss, unless they are made to correct an error, including in relation to deferred tax assets which, if recognised more than 12 months after the acquisition date, generate tax income. Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of “Investments in equity-accounted companies”. Goodwill The residual difference representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as goodwill. For each business combination, the Group may choose to account for non-controlling interests: - either at acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of goodwill on the non-controlling interests ###### (“full goodwill” method); - or based on the share of net identifiable assets of the acquired entity measured at fair value, in which case ###### goodwill is only recognised on the portion attributable to owners of the parent (“partial goodwill” method). Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that it may be impaired. The impairment testing approach is described in Note 3.4.5 “Impairment of assets” below. Impairment recognised against goodwill may not be reversed. Bargain purchases When the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired company exceeds the purchase price plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company, the negative goodwill is taken immediately to profit or loss in the period of the acquisition, after verifying the procedure for identifying and measuring the various items included in its calculation. Transactions involving non-controlling interests Changes in non-controlling interests that do not result in gain or loss of control are recognised in equity. In particular, when additional shares are acquired in an entity already controlled by the Group, the difference between the purchase price of the shares and the additional share of consolidated equity acquired is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the parent. The consolidated carrying amount of the subsidiary’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including goodwill) remains unchanged. Contingent consideration and/or earn-out Contingent consideration or earn-outs relating to a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair value, even if it is deemed unlikely they will be paid. After the acquisition date, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration/earn-outs result in an adjustment to goodwill only if they are made within the 12 months following the acquisition date (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. In all other cases, any such changes are taken to profit or loss, unless the consideration transferred is an equity instrument. ----- ###### The revised IFRS 3 gives certain indications as regards the accounting for contingent payment arrangements with employees or selling shareholders. These arrangements may be part of the business combination or may be considered as separate from the acquisition agreement for the target entity. In certain acquisitions, earn-out payments were considered part of the consideration for post-acquisition services rendered and are therefore expensed in the periods concerned and in future periods. Business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisitions) In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss on the date control was obtained. Goodwill at the date control is obtained is calculated as the fair value of consideration transferred (i.e., price paid) plus the fair value of the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company. Put options granted to non-controlling interests As part of certain transactions, the Group may put in place options contracts regarding consolidated investments. These may be call, puts or even reciprocal options, which may or not be contingent on certain conditions. Analysing these options contracts is often complex and requires a good understanding of the economics of the transaction carried out, along with the substance of the commitments binding the different categories of shareholder concerned. Options are therefore accounted for on a case-by-case basis in light of all known facts and circumstances. In granting a put option to non-controlling interests, the Group sells those non-controlling interests an option under which they can sell their shares. The non-controlling interests can exercise their put option, thereby requiring the Group to purchase the underlying shares at a specified exercise price and future date. In the absence of specific guidance from IFRS, these options are accounted for by the Group as follows:  The present value of the commitment at the reporting date is included within “Liabilities relating to put options on non-controlling interests”.  The corresponding non-controlling interests are cancelled. This accounting method does not affect the presentation of non-controlling interests in the statement of profit and loss. Pending completion of the work in progress at the IASB and IFRS IC, and in accordance with the AMF’s recommendations for companies preparing 2009 financial statements, subsequent changes in the value of the commitment are recognised in full by means of an adjustment to equity. When the put option is exercised, the Group derecognises the liability in respect of the deferred payment against the amount of cash effectively paid to the non- controlling interests. 3.4.2. Intangible assets Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets with no physical substance. In accordance with IAS 38, intangible assets that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost when the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is included as part of the cost of those assets only if it increases the future economic benefits associated with the assets concerned. Other costs are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that can be reliably measured, are controlled by the Group, and are separable or arise from legal or contractual rights are recognised at fair value separately from goodwill. ----- ###### Intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite useful life (software and licences) are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives: Client relationships: 18-21 years Software programs: 1-10 years Other intangible assets: 5 years Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. They are included with other assets within cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment using the discounted cash flow method at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. When the recoverable amount of these assets calculated based on criteria prevailing at the acquisition date falls below their carrying amount, an impairment provision is recorded. Trademarks Identifiable trademarks are measured using a multi-criteria approach that takes into consideration both their reputation and profitability. The Group classified its main “Foncia” trademark, along with the “Lodgis” and “Trévi” trademarks in Belgium and the “Domicim”, “ Brolliet” and “Gribi” trademarks in Switzerland, as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Costs incurred in creating a new trademark or developing an existing trademark are expensed. Business software programs Software acquired is carried at cost (purchase price plus ancillary expenses). When allocating the purchase price, certain software programs may also be measured using the replacement cost approach. Client relationships Client relationships include the list of mandates managed by the Group’s companies. A mandate is an instrument by which a person (the principal) gives another person (the agent) the power to carry out or enter into one or more legal actions or agreements, in the principal’s name. France’s Hoguet law requires professional property agents to hold a written mandate in order to put properties up for sale or to let, and to manage jointly owned property. In the majority of cases, client relationships are acquired separately as part of purchases of business goodwill and are therefore measured at cost. Client relationships can also be identified within the context of major business combinations, when they meet the identification and materiality criteria (in particular, the Group transacts on a recurring basis with the client). In this case, the Group uses the excess earnings method to measure the relationship. It should be noted that given the large number of external growth transactions carried out by the Group, client relationships are only identified and measured for major acquisitions. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly comprise the cost of acquiring new business. 3.4.3. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. ----- ###### The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including customs duties and non-recoverable taxes, and any costs directly incurred to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the purchase price. Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment or is recognised as a separate component where appropriate, if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group  and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All other maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs incurred to increase productivity or extend the useful life of an asset, which are capitalised. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the components approach over their estimated useful lives, taking into account any residual value. Straight-line depreciation is considered the method that best reflects the pattern in which the assets’ economic benefits are consumed by the Group: - Buildings: 20-50 years - Fixtures and fittings: 8-10 years - IT equipment: 4 years - Vehicle fleet: 5 years - Furniture: 10 years - Office equipment: 4 years ###### The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted where necessary. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there is evidence that they may be impaired. Gains and losses on asset disposals are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset concerned. 3.4.4. Leases Group as lessee The Group has many leases in which it acts as lessee across its entire French and international branch network. Its leases are of many different types, but are mainly leases of property or vehicles. Pursuant to IFRS 16 – Leases, on entering into a contract, the Group analyses the contractual provisions to determine whether it has the characteristics of a lease. It verifies whether the lease transfers in substance the right to control the use of an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. If these characteristics exist, as soon as the asset is made available the Group recognises: ▪ a right-of-use asset, which represents its right to use the leased asset over the lease term; ▪ a lease liability (“IFRS 16 lease liability”), which represents the present value of its obligation to make lease payments. The Group applies the same method to account for all leases in which it acts as lessee, and has chosen not to use the practical expedients set out in IFRS 16 exempting short-term leases (i.e., leases with terms of 12 months or less) or leases of low-value underlying assets from the scope of the standard. ----- ###### The amount of the right-of-use asset comprises: ▪ the amount of the associated lease liability; ▪ plus:  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,  any initial direct costs incurred to obtain the lease,  any estimated restoration costs to be incurred by the Group; ▪ less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. They are depreciated over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset for accounting purposes, whichever is shorter. The lease liability represents the present value of: ▪ fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; ▪ variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; ▪ amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; ▪ the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; ▪ penalties required for terminating the lease. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. To determine the lease term, the Group analyses the contractual provisions of the lease, as illustrated below: The Group remeasures the lease liability (and adjusts the corresponding right-of-use asset accordingly), when: ▪ there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; ▪ there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate; ▪ there is a change in the lease contract (lease modification) that is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. ----- ###### When the Group incurs a material obligation to restore the asset to the condition specified in the lease contract, the related costs are included as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability is increased accordingly. Group as lessor In certain specific businesses, the Group may enter into lease contracts as the lessor. This is notably the case for German subsidiary Vegis (acquisition carried out in January 2020), which sub-lets – mostly to students – accommodation which the company itself has leased. IFRS 16 first requires the contract to be identified as a sub-letting arrangement in accordance with provisions applicable to lessors, and then to determine whether that arrangement is a finance lease or an operating lease. Classification as a finance lease or an operating lease is based on the right-of-use asset obtained under the initial lease, and not on the underlying asset. To determine whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease, the Group performs an broad analysis to determine whether the contract transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards inherent to ownership of the leased asset to its client (the lessee). To perform this analysis, the Group determines whether: (i) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the client by the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset, and (iii) the present value of the lease payments amounts to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. This will then determine the accounting treatment applicable to the initial lease and to any sub-letting income. The asset recorded in respect of the initial lease is not derecognised and continues to be depreciated. Lease payments collected from the lessee in the sub-letting arrangement are taken to revenue. Based on their contractual characteristics, all of the Group’s sub-letting arrangements meet the definition of an operating lease within the meaning of IFRS 16. The asset recorded in respect of the initial lease is not derecognised and continues to be depreciated. Lease payments collected from the lessee in the sub-letting arrangement are taken to revenue. 3.4.5. Impairment of assets Impairment of assets with finite useful lives Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment whenever there is evidence that they may be impaired. Impairment recognised in profit or loss against property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be reversed. Impairment of assets with indefinite useful lives Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that they may be impaired. Cash-generating units For the purposes of these impairment tests, non-current assets that cannot be tested individually for impairment as they do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, are grouped into cash-generating units (CGUs). Impairment tests are carried out on each CGU or group of CGUs at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets for internal management purposes. ----- ###### The CGUs identified by the Group correspond to its major development and investment strategies. The Group has defined the following three cash-generating units: - Property Management France CGU, which includes the management of jointly owned properties, rental ###### management, lettings, the transactions business and client mandates; - Property Management International CGU, which includes the property management and transactions ###### businesses in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium; - Group of Services CGUs, which includes Constatimmo (brokerage for technical surveys), Assurimo (insurance ###### brokerage), Efficity (property appraisals website), FPM and Esset Management (BtoB property management), Prowen (brokerage specialised in energy purchases), Seiitra (property management software development), Tech-way (technical maintenance), Leemo (property platform), and Lodgis (furnished rentals). The Group decides whether or not to recognise an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities in a CGU or group of CGUs with their recoverable amount. Impairment indicators External indicators of impairment include changes in the general economic and financial environment, downtrends in local economic environments and changes in economic performance. These are analysed by the Group to determine whether the assets concerned should be tested for impairment more frequently. Method used to determine the recoverable amount An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of: - its fair value less the costs of disposal, representing the amount at which the Group could sell the asset (after ###### selling costs) in an arm’s length transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and - its value in use, representing the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the ###### continuing use and ultimate sale of an asset or CGU based on the most probable assumptions adopted by management. Fair value net of the costs of disposal is calculated based on available information used to establish the best estimate of the selling price net of costs to sell in an arm’s length transaction between fully informed, consenting parties. Value in use of CGUs or groups of CGUs is determined based on post-tax cash flows resulting from business plans and a terminal value calculated by extrapolating data for the last year of the business plan. The assumptions used are based on the budgets and business plans prepared by management for each business. These budgets are the latest budgets approved at the date of preparation of the financial statements. Other assumptions affecting the calculation of the recoverable amount include the growth rate, operating margin, the discount rate and the tax rate (see Note 4.1.2). The discount rate used to discount post-tax cash flows to their present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Where there is no specific discount rate for the assets tested, the average cost of capital is used. The discount rates are post-tax rates and are applied to post-tax cash flows.  The recoverable amount calculated using post-tax discount rates is equal to that which would have been obtained using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36. ----- ###### Recognition of impairment losses If the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the related assets are written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and then to the carrying amount of the other assets of the CGU, in proportion to their carrying amount. This must not result in the carrying amount of an individual asset falling below the higher of its fair value, value in use and zero. Impairment losses are recognised in other non-recurring operating expenses and may not be reversed. Reversal of impairment losses Impairment losses recognised against goodwill cannot be reversed. Impairment losses recognised against assets other than goodwill may only be reversed if there is evidence that the impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist. The amount reversed is then based on revised estimates of the asset’s recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to the reversal of an impairment loss should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset. 3.4.6. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, corresponding to their face value less any impairment losses recorded in the statement of profit and loss. In view of its business activities, the Group is exposed to limited bad debt risk on its commercial receivables as the risk is concentrated mainly in the B2B business, which accounts for less than 4% of consolidated revenue. 3.4.7. Financial instruments The measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities is defined by IFRS 9 – Financial instruments. Financial assets Financial assets include financial investments, shares in companies acquired in the process of being consolidated, deposits and guarantees paid, other long-term receivables, derivative instruments with a positive fair value and cash and cash equivalents. IFRS 9 applies a single analytical framework to all financial assets in order to determine the classification and basis of measurement to be used for accounting purposes. More specifically: ✓ Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets that will be recovered through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) are generally carried at amortised cost. Financial assets at amortised cost include operating financial assets, other loans and receivables and trade receivables. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest rate method. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets at amortised cost are written down by the amount of any expected credit losses. Impairment losses relating to commercial receivables are recognised in recurring operating profit items, while those relating to other financial assets are recognised in financial expenses. ✓ Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reclassifiable to profit or loss Financial assets that will be recovered both through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) and through sales of those assets are generally carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, with the exception of interest income and dividends, which are included in other financial income and expenses. Changes in fair value are reclassified to profit or loss when the assets are sold. ----- ###### ✓ Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income This category includes downpayments to equity investments and investments in non-consolidated companies, and equity instruments that the Group has irrevocably elected to classify in this category. When these investments are sold, the unrealised gains and losses previously carried in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss; only dividends will be taken to profit or loss. Fair value corresponds to the market price for listed securities or to the estimated fair value for unlisted securities, as determined according to the financial criteria most appropriate to the particular situation of each investment. The fair value of equity investments whose price is not quoted on an active market is determined based on the latest known transactions involving these investments. ✓ Assets at fair value through profit or loss All other debt and equity instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. These include marketable securities with an underlying term of more than three months, other financial assets held for trading and purchased for sale in the near term, and financial instruments with a positive fair value that are not eligible for hedge accounting. These assets are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value taken to financial income and expenses. At the acquisition date, the Group determines the classification of financial assets into one of the IFRS 9 categories based on the characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing the assets. The table below provides an overview of classification by financial asset category, along with the corresponding measurement approach:",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

130_4,Final Offerings 2021.md,67,FONCIA MANAGEMENT,67.60,Current financial assets,67.60.1,,"###### Financial liabilities Financial liabilities include borrowings and other payables as well as bank overdrafts. With the exception of trading liabilities and derivative instruments representing liabilities carried at fair value, borrowings and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, as appropriate, through a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. ----- ###### Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. Derivative instruments The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks on floating-rate borrowings and foreign exchange risks. In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, derivative instruments are measured on the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in the fair value of instruments not eligible for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss under other financial income and expenses. 3.4.8. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, as well as short-term highly-liquid deposits with an initial maturity of three months or less and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term investments are measured at market value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in market value taken to financial income and expenses. Investments in listed equities along with investments with an initial maturity of over three months and no early exit option are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and classified as current or non-current financial assets. Bank overdraft facilities are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and included in current borrowings and debit. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in profit or loss. For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents include the items defined above, net of short-term bank overdrafts. 3.4.9. Client accounts The Group conducts its property management business through mandates signed with clients, under which the companies are responsible for holding client funds. These funds consist of liquid assets received as guarantees, rent and expenses, joint ownership working capital and renovation funds, and funds received in connection with the transactions business. As an agent, the Group undertakes to hold client accounts and to recognise them in its statement of financial position using a specific account for each activity (property sales, rentals and management). The amount shown for client accounts within assets is equivalent to the amount shown for these accounts in liabilities. 3.4.10. Current and non-current provisions A provision is recognised when, at the end of the reporting period, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party resulting from a past event that is likely to give rise to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and can be measured reliably. Provisions may also be recognised for contingent liabilities arising on business combinations. In this case, they are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. When the Group expects partial or full repayment of the provision, for example owing to an insurance policy, the repayment is booked as a separate asset but only if such repayment is virtually certain. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision reflects the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligations, as calculated using a pre-tax discount rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and, where applicable, the risks specific to the liability. ----- ###### Since provisions are calculated based on estimated future contingencies and expenses, they are measured taking into account the assumptions deemed most probable at the reporting date. Items giving rise to provisions (trade and employee disputes, etc.) are reviewed regularly to allow for any adjustments. Provisions include amounts accrued in respect of business, employee-related and/or tax (excluding income tax) risks and disputes arising in the ordinary course of operations, as described below: ✓ Employee-related provisions (disputes, lay-offs, etc.) At the end of each reporting period, a provision is recognised and adjusted in line with the risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Human Resources department on a case-by-case basis. ✓ Provisions for rent payment guarantees A rent payment guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. Foncia bears the cost of any unpaid rent and advances to owners. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts (deriving from the del credere agreement) and are accounted for as follows: - the related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are deducted ###### from rents in the same way as basic fees; - once rent is reported as unpaid, a provision is recorded, calculated in accordance with IAS 37. ###### The amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). ✓ Provision for occupancy guarantees An occupancy guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days. ✓ Provision for URSSAF social security audits This concerns in-progress and completed URSSAF social security audits. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the related risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Payroll department on a case-by-case basis. ✓ Provisions for risks on client accounts Provisions for risks on client accounts are designed to cover the non-collection risk on lost client accounts in debit, as well as other risks on client accounts. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the risk exposure on client accounts, as assessed by the Group’s Client Operations department on a case-by-case basis. ✓ Provisions for third party and professional liability These provisions are recorded based on information provided by senior managers in charge of monitoring claims against their firm. The Audit, Legal and Accounting departments have the final decision in terms of whether or not to ----- ###### record a provision. If the claim is reported and covered by the liability insurance, the maximum provision will reflect the amount of the deductible (€15,000 as of 1 January 2014) or the amount of the estimated risk, whichever is lower. If the claim is not reported, the senior manager concerned sets the amount to be provisioned. ✓ Provisions for other disputes These provisions are intended to cover disputes, litigation and other foreseeable contingencies in connection with the Group’s businesses, along with miscellaneous contingencies and expenses. 3.4.11. Share-based payment and employee benefits Share-based payment In some circumstances, some of the Group’s employees may receive compensation in an arrangement involving a share-based payment. This was the case for an employee at Foncia Stark, who was a beneficiary of a free share plan (“AGA”). Due to the existence of a liquidity contract, this free share plan had been classified as a cash-settled plan within the meaning of IFRS 2. The cost of the services rendered had been recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period within production for own use, against an employee-related payable. Since the share-based payment was made to the beneficiary on 23 May 2020 for a cash amount of €200,000, the full amount of the related liability was extinguished at 31 December 2020. The capitalised costs will be amortised as from the date the “Millénium” project (development of new management software for the property management network) enters into service. At 31 December 2020, there were no other stock option or free share plans within the Foncia Group. Long-term incentive plans (LTIP) As part of its acquisition-led growth strategy and in order to accelerate its organisational realignment, in 2020 the Group appointed a new management team in Germany. The new management team will be responsible for developing the portfolio of mandates managed through selective acquisitions, and for the organizational and operational restructuring processes. In connection with this new appointment, the Group granted a long-term incentive plan with the following terms and conditions:  Grant date: 1 June 2020.  Reference period: 2 January 2020 to 31 December 2025.  Performance conditions: LTIP = % performance x equity value, with: (i) Equity value = Enterprise value - cash investments made in connection with acquisitions during the reference period  (ii) Enterprise value = 10 x increase in EBITDA during the reference period (iii) % performance = progressive rate (between 3% and 5%) based on revenue earned in 2025. In accordance with IFRS 2, the service cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period against an employee-related payable. The fair value of this liability will be remeasured at each reporting date until the liability is settled, based on assumptions used in the budget. In 2020, the cost of this incentive plan represented €0.3 million, and is shown in non-recurring operating items. Pensions and other post-employment benefits ✓ Short-term benefits Short-term benefits include paid annual leave, paid sick leave, bonuses and other benefits (other than contract termination benefits), expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period ----- ###### during which the employee services are rendered. Short-term benefits are expensed in the period in which the corresponding services are rendered by the employee. Any amounts not paid at the end of the reporting period are carried in current liabilities. ✓ Post-employment benefits In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which the Group operates, Foncia participates in, or operates, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Virtually all of the Group’s employees are entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by the Foncia Group to the beneficiaries when the rights allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds financed in compliance with the applicable government requirements and regulations. These plans may be funded by investments in various instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds. Post-employment benefits are measured and recognised by the Group in accordance with IAS 19 – Employee Benefits, as described below. - Defined contribution plans ###### Defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans are expensed as incurred in the statement of profit and loss based on contributions. - Defined benefit plans ###### The cost of defined benefit plans is measured on an actuarial basis. The related obligations are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on the agreements in effect in each company. Obligations are determined by reference to assumptions that are revised each year and relate for example to length of service, life expectancy, salary inflation and employee turnover, and also take into account macroeconomic assumptions for the various countries in which the Group does business (e.g., discount rate and inflation rate). The assumptions used for 2020 are detailed in Note 4.12. A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position for the difference between the related projected benefit obligation (actuarial liability) and any plan assets as measured at fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses. If plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation recognised, a non-current asset is recorded for the amount of the plans in the consolidated statement of financial position. A funding surplus (net defined benefit asset) is only recognised in the statement of financial position if its represents future economic benefits that will actually be available to the Group. When the calculation of the net benefit obligation gives rise to an asset for the Group, the amount recognised as an asset cannot exceed the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the plan or future reductions in contributions to the plan. Expenses under defined benefit plans comprise three components, accounted for as described below: - Service cost is recognised under personnel costs within operating profit. It includes service cost for the period, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments, which are recognised in full in profit or loss for the period in which they arose, and gains and losses arising on plan settlements. - Interest cost is recognised in other financial income and expenses and reflects the impact of discounting the obligations, net of the expected return on plan assets as measured using the discount rate applied to calculate those obligations. ----- ###### - Remeasurements of the net liability (or net asset) are included in other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss, and do not impact the statement of profit and loss. They essentially comprise actuarial gains and losses, i.e., changes in the benefit obligation and in plan assets attributable to changes in assumptions and experience adjustments. Experience adjustments represent the difference between the expected impact of certain actuarial assumptions applied to previous measurements of the obligation and actual experience. ✓ Other long-term benefits Other long-term benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19. The estimated cost of these benefits is recognised within non-current liabilities over the employees’ qualifying years of service. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs attributable to amendments to an existing plan or the introduction of a new plan are taken immediately to profit or loss. In France, the collective bargaining agreement for the real estate industry stipulates that all active employees who so request are entitled to one month’s salary at every anniversary date: after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of professional experience. Professional experience is considered overall and not as experience solely within the Group. However, the Group is only liable for the amount proportionate to the employee’s seniority in the Group. The Group’s obligation under long-service awards is assessed each year by an independent expert. The assumptions used for 2020 are detailed in Note 4.12. 3.4.12. Deferred tax Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes, using the tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the asset is realised and the liability settled, on the basis of tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax does not arise on: - the initial recognition of goodwill; - the initial recognition of an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the ###### accounting profit (loss) nor taxable profit (loss); - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, to the extent that it is probable they will not ###### reverse in the foreseeable future. Tax on items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income, respectively, and not in the statement of profit and loss. Deferred tax assets arising on temporary differences (after offsetting against deferred tax liabilities) or on tax losses and tax credits carried forward are only recognised to the extent that it is probable they will reverse and that the Group will generate future taxable earnings against which they can be utilised pursuant to local tax laws. The following are taken into account when assessing the Group’s ability to recover these assets: - forecasts of future taxable earnings; - taxable earnings in previous years. ###### Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity. ----- ###### 3.4.13. Trade payables and other current liabilities Trade payables and other current liabilities are liabilities to be settled or renegotiated within the ordinary operating cycle or within 12 months following the end of the reporting period. Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (see Note 3.4.7). These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. The value of items that will be paid over the long term is discounted. 3.4.14. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the end of the reporting period, either for accounting purposes or for disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. IFRS 13 sets out a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value: - Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or ###### liability, either directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., price-based inputs). - Level 3: inputs relating to the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable ###### inputs). The Group primarily uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, cash management financial assets and identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 4.18. 3.4.15. Assets classified as held for sale, businesses sold or in the process of sale and discontinued operations IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations sets forth the accounting requirements applicable to assets held for sale, along with the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations. IFRS 5 requires assets held for sale to be presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial position for the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell, provided that they meet the definition of assets held for sale set out in the standard. When the Group is engaged in a sale process resulting in the loss of control of a subsidiary, the entire assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, regardless of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the subsidiary after the sale. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. The assets and liabilities concerned are reclassified in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, and no offsetting is permitted. Businesses held for sale or discontinued are presented on a separate line in the statement of profit and loss for the periods presented, which shows post-tax profit or loss attributable to discontinued operations and the post-tax gain ----- ###### or loss on the disposal or the measurement to fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups comprising the business sold or in the process of sale. Operations that are abandoned or discontinued are defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major line of business and meets the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale or has been sold by the Group. Similarly, cash flows attributable to abandoned or discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods presented. Under IFRS 5, profits or losses related to discontinued operations are also to be shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of profit and loss, retrospectively for all periods presented. A discontinued operation can be defined as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and: ▪ represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; ▪ is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or ▪ is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 3.4.16. Presentation of the statement of profit and loss As permitted under IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements, the Group has chosen to present operating expenses by nature. “Recurring operating profit (loss)”, “Operating profit (loss)”, “Cost of gross debt” and “Cost of net debt” in the statement of profit and loss and gains and losses recognised directly in equity are presented in accordance with the criteria set out in ANC Recommendation No. 2013-03 issued by the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables). 3.4.17. Revenue Revenue for the Group results from sales of services within the scope of the ordinary operations of consolidated subsidiaries, less revenue from intragroup transactions. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. In accordance with IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, and specific criteria are met by each of the Group’s businesses. ❖ Jointly owned property management business From a contractual and legal perspective, the Group’s jointly owned property management business is mostly conducted through mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services such as: ▪ preparing, convening and organising General Meetings; ▪ managing the joint owners’ council; ▪ managing the financial operations and keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association; ▪ managing the jointly owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations; ▪ carrying out periodic visits and inspections of the jointly owned property. ----- ###### All such services are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association. Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognised on a straight-line basis over the period during which the services are provided. Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and disputes. Since each additional service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognised when the service is performed. ❖ Rental management business In its rental management business, the Group acts as agent for owners-lessors and fulfils a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These mainly concern: ▪ routine management services, for example, rent reviews and collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, sending of rent receipts to lessees, and deposits; ▪ other one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of documentation, management of claims, administrative filings, and requests for subsidies; ▪ technical management services, such as on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys, and preparation of essential information documents for lessees; ▪ insurance against unpaid rent; ▪ other insurance such as for vacant premises or property damage. These represent separate service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognised separately. Revenue from services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance (falling outside the scope of IFRS 4) is recognised on a straight-line basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue from one-off services is recognised when those services are provided. ❖ Lettings Revenue is recognised at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted. The Group collects fees from owners and from lessees. ❖ Transactions business/Efficity Revenue on the transactions business is recognised upon signature of the notarised final sale agreement (acte authentique), which is the date on which control is presumed to have been transferred. ❖ Client accounts Interest income generated on client funds is booked in revenue. ❖ Assurimo Assurismo provides property insurance brokerage services. Revenue under comprehensive property insurance and comprehensive homeowners’ insurance policies is recognised over the term of the cover, since services in this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis. ❖ Constatimmo Constatimmo carries out mandatory technical surveys on premises, as well as inventories of premises for lessees. Its revenue is recognised and measured when the related services are performed. ----- ###### ❖ Seiitra Seiitra provides specialist IT property services and developed the Thetrawin software, which it markets through the sale of software licenses. These property management tools offer the full suite of functionalities needed to keep accounting records for client accounts and to manage suspense accounts, jointly owned properties and rentals, as well as the budget of jointly owned property associations. Maintenance fees are recognised on a straight-line basis, since the corresponding services are provided over time. ❖ Esset Management Esset Management provides property management services (jointly owned property management and rental services) for institutions. The accounting principles applied are the same as those explained above for the private property management business. ❖ Foncia Valorisation Foncia Valorisation provides investment strategy consulting and arbitrage (appraisals, lending, block/unit property sales) for institutional clients or wealthy families. Its revenue is recognised upon signature of the notarised final sale agreement and is based on a percentage of the sale price. ❖ Leemo Leemo, a wholly-owned Group subsidiary since 2017, is a listing service for properties for sale. It has developed a digital platform for property companies where it lists new real estate projects by different developers as well as certain older properties that are to be made available for sale to private and institutional investors. It derives its revenue from two main sources:  fees on sale agreements: amounts billed to developers and partially retroceded to business providers. Only the net margin is recognised in revenue.  fees on bundles of services sold to developers without any retrocession requirements. Revenue from fees on sale agreements is recognised when the notarised final sale agreement is signed. Revenue from fees earned on bundles of services is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period during which the services are provided. 3.4.18. Recurring operating profit (loss) Recurring operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, with the exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses)”. Recurring operating profit (loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes all items included in operating profit (loss), restated for any non-recurring items.  Costs relating to mergers and acquisitions or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit. 3.4.19. Non-recurring operating income (expenses) This caption includes non-recurring income and expense items that, owing to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as arising in the ordinary course of the Group’s operations and are therefore not reported in recurring operating profit (loss). They include impacts of changes in the scope of consolidation, goodwill impairment, and non-recurring amortisation and impairment charged against trademarks and software. If material, non-recurring items also include the effects of certain unusual transactions such as capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring fees, fees relating to major claims and disputes, and any other non-recurring income or expenses. ----- ###### It should be noted that for transactions directly related to external growth and projects to transform or restructure the business (particularly mergers and reorganisations), a detailed procedure is in place to identify, classify and validate any transactions of a non-recurring nature. This procedure gives a precise indication of transactions that meet the criteria to be recorded in this category. During this unprecedented year, the Group was required to purchase protective materials and equipment for its employees and clients. These Covid-19-related expenses are shown on a line within “Other expenses”, which is included in the calculation of non-recurring operating income (expenses). This accounting approach reflects the unusual nature of these expenses. 3.4.20. Operating profit (loss) Operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, irrespective of whether they are of a recurring nature or whether they result from one-off decisions or transactions. 3.4.21. Cost of net debt The cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses incurred by the Group on borrowings and lease liabilities pursuant to IFRS 16, less financial income from cash investments. 3.4.22. Income tax Income tax expense for the year includes current and deferred income tax expense, which are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group calculates its current taxes in accordance with the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which its earnings are taxable. Current tax expense is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable profit. However, management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax authorities. Income tax expense includes the amounts reported by French subsidiaries in respect of the CVAE tax assessed on value added, since the Group considers this tax meets the definition of income tax set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes. When they have not been set against income tax, income tax credits that are not included in the calculation of taxable profit and that are always refunded by the State are recorded as subsidies and reduce the expenses to which they relate. 3.4.23. Earnings (loss) per share Earnings (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) attributable to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period (excluding treasury shares). 3.4.24. Operating segments The Group is not concerned by IFRS 8 – Operating Segments. Revenue is broken down by business in Note 5.1. 3.4.25. Statement of cash flows Consolidated cash and cash equivalents, changes in which are displayed in the statement of cash flows, are defined as the net balance of cash and cash equivalents, current bank overdraft facilities and bank credit balances repayable on demand that form an integral part of the cash management strategy. ----- ###### Changes in cash from operating activities are calculated based on operating profit (loss) adjusted for transactions with no cash impact. NOTE 4. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Goodwill 4.1.1. Changes in the period At 31 December 2020, goodwill is carried within assets in the statement of financial position for €1,445.4 million. The main changes in the period can be summarised as follows: SPPI Hold-to-collect Amortised cost SPPI Other FV through PL ###### Financial liabilities Financial liabilities include borrowings, other financing and overdraft facilities, and derivative instruments with a negative fair value. With the exception of trading liabilities and derivative instruments representing liabilities carried at fair value, borrowings and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, as appropriate, through a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. ----- ###### Derivative instruments The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks on floating-rate borrowings and foreign exchange risks. In accordance with IFRS, hedge accounting may be applied to a hedging transaction provided that: - the hedge is documented (entity’s objectives, hedging strategy, identification of the components of the ###### hedging relationship, etc.); - the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. ###### A hedge is highly effective if it meets all of the following hedge effectiveness criteria: - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, - the credit risk is not of a magnitude that it dominates the value changes that result from the economic relationship, - the hedge ratio is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item; - effectiveness can be measured reliably and is calculated in the context of continuing operations. ###### For the periods presented, no interest rate or foreign currency derivatives used by the Group are classified as hedging instruments. In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, derivative instruments are measured on the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in the fair value of instruments not eligible for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss under other financial income and expenses. 3.4.11. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, as well as short-term highly-liquid deposits with an initial maturity of three months or less and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term investments are measured at market value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in market value taken to financial income and expenses. Investments in listed equities, investments with an initial maturity of over three months and no early exit option and restricted (i.e., blocked) bank accounts are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and classified as current or non-current financial assets. Bank overdraft facilities are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and included in current financial liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in profit or loss. For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents include the items defined above, net of short-term bank overdrafts. ----- ###### 3.4.12. Client accounts The Group conducts its property management business through mandates signed with clients, under which the companies are responsible for holding client funds. These funds consist of guarantee deposits received, rent and expenses, joint ownership working capital and renovation funds, and funds received in connection with the transactions business. As an agent, the Group undertakes to hold client accounts and to recognise them in its statement of financial position using a specific account for each activity (property sales, rentals and management). 3.4.13. Current and non-current provisions A provision is recognised when, at the end of the reporting period, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party resulting from a past event that is likely to give rise to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and can be measured reliably. Provisions may also be recognised for contingent liabilities arising on business combinations. In this case, they are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. When the Group expects partial or full repayment of the provision, for example owing to an insurance policy, the repayment is booked as a separate asset but only if such repayment is virtually certain. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision reflects the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligations, as calculated using a pre-tax discount rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and, where applicable, the risks specific to the liability. Since provisions are calculated based on estimated future contingencies and expenses, they are measured taking into account the assumptions deemed most probable at the reporting date. Items giving rise to provisions (trade and employee disputes, etc.) are reviewed regularly to allow for any adjustments. Provisions include amounts accrued in respect of business, employee-related and/or tax (excluding income tax) risks and disputes arising in the ordinary course of operations, as described below:  Employee-related provisions (disputes, lay-offs, etc.) At the end of each reporting period, a provision is recognised and adjusted in line with the risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Human Resources department on a case-by-case basis.  Provisions for rent payment guarantees A rent payment guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. Foncia bears the cost of any unpaid rent and advances to owners. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts (deriving from the del credere agreement) and are accounted for as follows: - the related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are ###### deducted from rents in the same way as basic fees; - once rent is reported as unpaid, a provision is recorded, calculated in accordance with IAS 37. ###### The amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). ----- ######  Provision for occupancy guarantees An occupancy guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days.  Provision for URSSAF social security audits This concerns in-progress and completed URSSAF social security audits. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the related risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Payroll department on a case-by-case basis.  Provisions for risks on client accounts Provisions for risks on client accounts are designed to cover the non-collection risk on lost client accounts in debit, as well as other risks on client accounts. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the risk exposure on client accounts, as assessed by the Group’s Client Operations department on a case-by-case basis.  Provisions for third party and professional liability These provisions are recorded based on information provided by senior managers in charge of monitoring claims against their firm. The Audit, Legal and Accounting departments have the final decision in terms of whether or not to record a provision. If the claim is reported and covered by the liability insurance, the maximum provision will reflect the amount of the deductible (€15,000 as of 1 January 2014) or the amount of the estimated risk, whichever is lower. If the claim is not reported, the senior manager concerned sets the amount to be provisioned.  Provisions for other disputes These provisions are intended to cover disputes, litigation and other foreseeable contingencies in connection with the Group’s businesses, along with miscellaneous contingencies and expenses. 3.4.14. Share-based payment and employee benefits Share-based payment A free share plan was set up for certain Foncia Stark employees, who will receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments. The main characteristics of this plan are as follows: - Grant date: 23 May 2018. - Date on which the continuing employment condition is assessed: 23 May 2020. - Vesting period for the shares: between 23 May 2018 and 23 May 2020. - Maximum number of shares awarded: up to 205,000 free shares in the company, representing 5.125% of its ###### share capital. - Maximum aggregate amount of the free share plan: €410,000. - The shares awarded are monetised through a new liquidity contract that prices the share using a calculation ###### formula. - Corporate social contribution (forfait social): 20% of the free share plan. ----- ###### Since a liquidity contract has been set up, the shares awarded to beneficiaries will be settled in cash. The free share plan therefore meets the definition of a “cash-settled” plan set out in IFRS 2. Consequently, the service cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the rights, with a direct offsetting entry to employee-related liabilities. This service cost is reviewed each year in light of budget assumptions and employee turnover. At 31 December 2019, the free share plan only concerned one employee and 100,000 free shares, representing a maximum aggregate amount of €200,000. The other beneficiaries of the plan had left the company. The impact of the revised service cost was recognised in the statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding adjustment to employee-related liabilities. The net service cost for 2019 represents €20,000 on account of the provision accrued in 2018. This cost was included within capitalised production with an adjusting entry to employee-related payables. It will be amortised as from the date the “Millénium” project (development of new management software for the property management network) enters into service. There are no stock option or free share plans in place at Foncia Management. Pensions and other post-employment benefits  Short-term benefits Short-term benefits include paid annual leave, paid sick leave, bonuses and other benefits (other than contract termination benefits), expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period during which the employee services are rendered. Short-term benefits are expensed in the period in which the corresponding services are rendered by the employee. Any amounts not paid at the end of the reporting period are carried in current liabilities.  Post-employment benefits In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which the Group operates, Foncia participates in, or operates, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Virtually all of the Group’s employees are entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by the Foncia Group to the beneficiaries when the rights allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds financed in compliance with the applicable government requirements and regulations. These plans may be funded by investments in various instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds. Post-employment benefits are measured and recognised by the Group in accordance with IAS 19 – Employee Benefits, as described below. - Defined contribution plans ###### Defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans are expensed as incurred in the statement of profit and loss based on contributions. - Defined benefit plans ###### The cost of defined benefit plans is measured on an actuarial basis. The related obligations are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on the agreements in effect in each company. Obligations are determined by reference to assumptions that are revised each year and relate for example to length of service, life expectancy, salary inflation and employee turnover, and also take into account macroeconomic assumptions for the various countries in which the Group does business (e.g., discount rate and inflation rate). The assumptions used for 2019 are detailed in Note 4.13. ----- ###### A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position for the difference between the related projected benefit obligation (actuarial liability) and any plan assets as measured at fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses. If plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation recognised, a non-current asset is recorded for the amount of the plans in the consolidated statement of financial position. A funding surplus (net defined benefit asset) is only recognised in the statement of financial position if its represents future economic benefits that will actually be available to the Group. When the calculation of the net benefit obligation gives rise to an asset for the Group, the amount recognised as an asset cannot exceed the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or future reductions in contributions to the plan. Expenses under defined benefit plans comprise three components, accounted for as described below: - Service cost is recognised under personnel costs within operating profit. It includes service cost for the period, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments, which are recognised in full in profit or loss for the period in which they arose, and gains and losses arising on plan settlements. - Interest cost is recognised in other financial income and expenses and reflects the impact of discounting the obligations, net of the expected return on plan assets as measured using the discount rate applied to calculate those obligations. - Remeasurements of the net liability (or net asset) are included in other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss, and do not impact the statement of profit and loss. They essentially comprise actuarial gains and losses, i.e., changes in the benefit obligation and in plan assets attributable to changes in assumptions and experience adjustments. Experience adjustments represent the difference between the expected impact of certain actuarial assumptions applied to previous measurements of the obligation and actual experience.  Other long-term benefits Other long-term benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19. The estimated cost of these benefits is recognised within non-current liabilities over the employees’ qualifying years of service. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs attributable to amendments to an existing plan or the introduction of a new plan are taken immediately to profit or loss. In France, the collective bargaining agreement for the real estate industry stipulates that all active employees who so request are entitled to one month’s salary at every anniversary date: after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of professional experience. Professional experience is considered overall and not as experience solely within the Group. However, the Group is only liable for the amount proportionate to the employee’s seniority in the Group. The Group’s obligation under long-service awards is assessed each year by an independent expert. The assumptions used for 2019 are detailed in Note 4.13. 3.4.15. Deferred taxes Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes, using the tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the asset is realised and the liability settled, on the basis of tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax does not arise on: - the initial recognition of goodwill; - the initial recognition of an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the ###### accounting profit (loss) nor taxable profit (loss); ----- - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, to the extent that it is probable they will not ###### reverse in the foreseeable future. Tax on items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income, respectively, and not in the statement of profit and loss. Deferred tax assets arising on temporary differences (after offsetting against deferred tax liabilities) or on tax losses and tax credits carried forward are only recognised to the extent that it is probable they will reverse and that the Group will generate future taxable earnings against which they can be utilised. The following are taken into account when assessing the Group’s ability to recover these assets: - forecasts of future taxable earnings; - taxable earnings in previous years. ###### Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity. 3.4.16. Trade payables and other current liabilities Trade payables and other current liabilities are liabilities to be settled or renegotiated within the ordinary operating cycle or within 12 months following the end of the reporting period. Trade payables and other liabilities meet the definition of financial liabilities at amortised cost as defined by IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (see Note 3.4.10). These financial liabilities are initially recognised at nominal value, insofar as this represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value given their short-term nature. The value of items that will be paid over the long term is discounted. 3.4.17. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the end of the reporting period, either for accounting purposes or for disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. IFRS 13 sets out a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value: - Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or ###### liability, either directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., price-based inputs). - Level 3: inputs relating to the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable ###### inputs). The Group primarily uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, cash management financial assets and identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 4.19. ----- ###### 3.4.18. Assets classified as held for sale, businesses sold or in the process of sale and discontinued operations IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations sets forth the accounting requirements applicable to assets held for sale, along with the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations. IFRS 5 requires assets held for sale to be presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial position for the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell, provided that they meet the definition of assets held for sale set out in the standard. When the Group is engaged in a sale process resulting in the loss of control of a subsidiary, the entire assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, regardless of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the subsidiary after the sale. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. The assets and liabilities concerned are reclassified in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, and no offsetting is permitted. Businesses sold or in the process of sale are presented on a separate line in the statement of profit and loss for the periods presented, which shows post-tax profit or loss attributable to discontinued operations and the post-tax gain or loss on the disposal or the measurement to fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups comprising the business sold or in the process of sale. A business sold or in the process of sale discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major line of business and meets the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale or has been sold by the Group. Similarly, cash flows attributable to businesses sold or in the process of sale are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods presented. Under IFRS 5, profits or losses related to discontinued operations are also to be shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of profit and loss, retrospectively for all periods presented. A discontinued operation can be defined as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and:  represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;  is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or  is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 3.4.19. Presentation of the statement of profit and loss As permitted under IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements, the Group has chosen to present operating expenses by nature. “Recurring operating profit (loss)”, “Operating profit (loss)”, “Cost of gross debt” and “Cost of net debt” in the statement of profit and loss and gains and losses recognised directly in equity are presented in accordance with the criteria set out in ANC Recommendation No. 2013-03 issued by the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables). ----- ###### 3.4.20. Revenue Revenue for the Group results from sales of services within the scope of the ordinary operations of consolidated subsidiaries, less revenue from intragroup transactions. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. In accordance with IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, and specific criteria are met by each of the Group’s businesses.  Jointly owned property management business From a contractual and legal perspective, the Group’s jointly owned property management business is mostly conducted through mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services such as:  preparing, convening and organising General Meetings;  managing the joint owners’ council;  managing the financial operations and keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association;  managing the jointly owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations;  carrying out periodic visits and inspections of the jointly owned property. All such services are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association. Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis (over time) based on actual amounts billed (costs are in line with the billed amounts). Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and disputes. Since each additional service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognised when the service is performed.  Rental management business In its rental management business, the Group acts as agent for owners-lessors and fulfils a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These mainly concern:  routine management services, for example, rent reviews and collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, sending of rent receipts to lessees, and deposits;  other one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of documentation, management of claims, administrative filings, and requests for subsidies;  technical management services, such as on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys, and preparation of essential information documents for lessees;  insurance against unpaid rent;  other insurance such as for vacant premises or property damage. These represent separate service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognised separately. Revenue from services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance (falling outside the scope of IFRS 4) is recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue from one-off services is recognised when those services are provided. ----- ######  Lettings Revenue is recognised at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted. The Group collects fees from owners and from lessees.  Transactions business/Efficity Revenue on the transactions business is recognised upon signature of the notarised final sale agreement (acte authentique), which is the date on which control is presumed to have been transferred.  Client accounts Interest income generated on client funds is booked in revenue.  Assurimo Assurismo provides property insurance brokerage services. Revenue under comprehensive property insurance and comprehensive homeowners’ insurance policies is recognised over the term of the cover, since services in this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis.  Constatimmo Constatimmo carries out mandatory technical surveys on premises, as well as inventories of premises for lessees. Its revenue is recognised and measured when the related services are performed.  Seiitra Seiitra provides specialist IT property services and developed the Thetrawin software, which it markets through the sale of software licenses. These property management tools offer the full suite of functionalities needed to keep accounting records for client accounts and to manage suspense accounts, jointly owned properties and rentals, as well as the budget of jointly owned property associations. Maintenance fees are recognised on a straight-line, percentage-of-completion basis, since the corresponding services are provided over time.  Esset Management Esset Management provides property management services (jointly owned property management and rental services) for institutions. The accounting principles applied are the same as those explained above for the private property management business.  Foncia Valorisation Foncia Valorisation provides investment strategy consulting and arbitrage (appraisals, lending, block/unit property sales) for institutional clients or wealthy families. Its revenue is recognised at the date the notarised final sale agreement is signed and is based on a percentage of the sale price.  Leeemo Leemo, a wholly-owned Group subsidiary since 2017, is a listing service for properties for sale. It has developed a digital platform for property companies where it lists new real estate projects by different developers as well as certain older properties that are to be made available for sale to private and institutional investors. It derives its revenue from two main sources:  fees on sale agreements: amounts billed to developers and partially retroceded to business providers. Only the net margin is recognised in revenue.  fees on bundles of services sold to developers without any retrocession requirements. ----- ###### Revenue from fees on sale agreements is recognised when the notarised final sale agreement is signed. Revenue from fees earned on bundles of services is recognised on a pro rata basis in the period. 3.4.21. Recurring operating profit (loss) Recurring operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, with the exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses)”. Recurring operating profit (loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes all items included in operating profit (loss), restated for any non-recurring items.  Costs relating to business combinations or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit (loss). 3.4.22. Non-recurring operating income (expenses) This caption includes income and expense items that, owing to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as arising in the ordinary course of the Group’s operations and are therefore not reported in recurring operating profit (loss). Non-recurring items are limited, unusual and/or irregular items of a material amount. They include impacts of changes in the scope of consolidation, goodwill impairment, and amortisation and impairment charged against trademarks and software. If material, non-recurring items also include the effects of certain unusual transactions such as capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring fees, fees relating to major claims and disputes, and any other income or expenses likely to affect the comparability of recurring operating profit (loss) from one period to the next. It should be noted that for transactions directly related to external growth and projects to transform or restructure the business (particularly mergers and reorganisations), a detailed procedure is in place to identify, classify and validate any transactions of a non-recurring nature. This procedure gives a precise indication of transactions that meet the criteria to be recorded in this category. 3.4.23. Operating profit (loss) Operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, irrespective of whether they are of a recurring nature or whether they result from one-off decisions or transactions. 3.4.24. Cost of net debt The cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings, less financial income from cash investments. 3.4.25. Income tax Income tax expense for the year includes current and deferred income tax expense, which are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group calculates its current taxes in accordance with the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which its earnings are taxable. Current tax expense is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable profit. However, management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax authorities. Income tax expense includes the amounts reported by French subsidiaries in respect of the CVAE tax assessed on value added, since the Group considers this tax meets the definition of income tax set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes. ----- ###### When they have not been set against income tax, income tax credits that are not included in the calculation of taxable profit and that are always refunded by the State are recorded as subsidies and reduce the expenses to which they relate. 3.4.26. Earnings (loss) per share Earnings (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) attributable to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period (excluding treasury shares). Operating segments The Group is not concerned by IFRS 8 – Operating Segments. Revenue is broken down by business in Note 5.1. 3.4.27. Statement of cash flows Consolidated cash and cash equivalents, changes in which are displayed in the statement of cash flows, are defined as the net balance of cash and cash equivalents, current bank overdraft facilities and bank credit balances repayable on demand that form an integral part of the cash management strategy. Changes in cash from operating activities are calculated based on operating profit (loss) adjusted for transactions with no cash impact. ----- ###### NOTE 4. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Goodwill 4.1.1. Changes in the period At 31 December 2019, goodwill is carried within assets in the statement of financial position for €1,328.6 million. The main changes in the period can be summarized as follows: Newly Goodwill** Deconsolidated Translation Assets classified ###### 3.4.9. Leases Loans and receivables Amortised cost SPPI Hold-to-collect Amortised cost Assets at fair value FV through PL SPPI Other FV through PL through PL ###### Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are expensed in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental income is included in income on a straight-line basis. Finance leases The Group acquires certain property, plant and equipment used in its operations under finance leases. These assets are recognised in assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. In accordance with IAS 17, assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, with a matching entry to liabilities for the equivalent value of the assets. The Group subsequently applies the cost model rather than the remeasurement approach, in accordance with IAS 16 and IAS 38. Payments under finance leases recognised in the annual financial statements are restated to reflect the gradual reduction in the liability and the fixed or floating-rate interest intrinsic to the lease. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the same periods as assets of a similar nature that are acquired directly. 3.4.10. Cash and cash equivalents The amount shown in cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position includes cash at bank and cash equivalents (short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value). Short-term investments are remeasured at market value at the end of each reporting period. Investments in listed equities, investments with an initial maturity of over three months and no early exit option and restricted (i.e., blocked) bank accounts are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and classified as current or non-current financial assets. Short-term bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings within current liabilities in the statement of financial position ----- ###### For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents include the items defined above, net of short-term bank overdrafts. 3.4.11. Client accounts Under their mandates, property management companies hold client funds consisting of guarantee deposits received, rent and expenses, joint ownership working capital and renovation funds, and funds received in connection with the Transactions business. As an agent, the Group undertakes to hold client accounts and to recognise them for each activity (transactions, rentals and management). 3.4.12. Recognition and measurement of financial liabilities Borrowings are initially measured at the fair value of the amount received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Borrowings After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments to the net carrying amount of the financial liability in order to determine its amortised cost. Other financial liabilities Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost. 3.4.13. Derivative instruments The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks on floating-rate borrowings and foreign exchange risks. In accordance with IFRS, hedge accounting may be applied to a hedging transaction provided that: - the hedge is documented (entity’s objectives, hedging strategy, identification of the components of the ###### hedging relationship, etc.); - the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. A ###### hedge is highly effective if it meets all of the following hedge effectiveness criteria: - there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, - the credit risk is not of a magnitude that it dominates the value changes that result from the economic relationship, - the hedge ratio is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item; - effectiveness can be measured reliably and is calculated in the context of continuing operations. ###### For the periods presented, no interest rate or foreign currency derivatives used by the Group are classified as hedging instruments. In accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, derivative instruments are measured on the statement of financial position at fair value. Changes in the fair value of instruments not eligible for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss under other financial income and expenses. ----- ###### 3.4.14. Current and non-current provisions A provision is recognised when, at the end of the reporting period, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to a third party resulting from a past event that is likely to give rise to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and can be measured reliably. When the Group expects partial or full repayment of the provision, for example owing to an insurance policy, the repayment is booked as a separate asset but only if such repayment is virtually certain. Since provisions are estimated based on assumptions regarding future contingencies and expenses, the amount thereof is based partly on uncertain factors and may be adjusted in future periods. The impact of discounting is taken into account only if it is material. Items giving rise to provisions (trade and labour disputes, etc.) are reviewed regularly to allow for any adjustments. The amount accrued in provisions represents the Group’s best estimate of the net outflow of resources. Provisions may also be recognised for contingent liabilities arising on business combinations. In this case, they are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. At the end of subsequent reporting periods, they are measured at the higher of the amount recognized in accordance with IAS 37 and the amount recorded on initial recognition, less any cumulative income recognised in accordance with IFRS 15. Employee-related provisions (labour disputes, lay-offs, etc.) At the end of each reporting period, a provision is recognised and adjusted in line with the risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Human Resources department on a case-by-case basis. Provisions for rent payment guarantees A rent payment guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. Foncia bears the cost of any unpaid rent and advances to owners. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts (deriving from the del credere agreement) and are accounted for as follows: - the related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are deducted ###### from rents in the same way as basic fees; - once rent is reported as unpaid, a provision is recorded, calculated in accordance with IAS 37. ###### The Group has set up a provision for risks relating to rent payment guarantees based on a progressive provisioning rate that increases in line with the age of the debt. Provision for occupancy guarantees An occupancy guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Foncia with the management of their property. The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. Provision for URSSAF social security audits A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the related risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Payroll department on a case-by-case basis. ----- ###### Provisions for risks on client accounts A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the risk exposure on customer accounts (debit accounts, etc.), as assessed by the Group’s Customer Operations department on a case-by-case basis. Provisions for third party and professional liability These provisions are recorded based on information provided by senior managers in charge of monitoring claims against the Group. The Audit, Legal and Accounting departments have the final decision in terms of whether or not to record a provision. Provisions for other disputes These provisions are intended to cover disputes, litigation and other foreseeable contingencies in connection with the Group’s businesses, along with miscellaneous contingencies and expenses. Update on the UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) dispute On 1 October 2014, UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) brought proceedings against Foncia Groupe before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance (regional court) seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by lessees of Foncia-managed properties who were unduly charged for receiving notices to pay (avis d’échéance). More specifically, UFC is seeking payment from Foncia Groupe of an amount of €2.30 per month and per lessee over a period of five years and estimates the number of lessees concerned at 318,400, bringing the total damages to €44 million. In its defence, the Group argues that the French law of 6 July 1989 on residential lease agreements, upon the basis of which UFC filed its claim, made no provision for class actions at the time of the alleged offence; that no law existed preventing the company from charging lessees for receiving notices to pay; and that this was therefore a lawful practice. Oral arguments were exchanged before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance in March 2018. The decision handed down in May 2018 dismissed UFC’s claims on the grounds that they fell outside the scope of a class action. UFC has appealed this decision and the case is pending hearings before the Court of Appeal. The Group considers that no provision needs to be accrued in this respect in its financial statements at 31 December 2018. Update on the dispute with franchisees Certain franchisees brought proceedings against Foncia after having been notified that their contracts would not be renewed. They accuse the Group of wrongful termination and various breaches of the franchise agreements. Of the 19 initial lawsuits in 2014, Foncia either settled (most sensitive disputes), or won (before the lower court or on appeal) the cases. Only eight franchisees took their case to the Cour de Cassation (supreme court), which partially struck down the appeal rulings that had found in favour of Foncia. The eight cases therefore face a retrial before a court of appeal to which the case has been referred. The decisions are expected in early 2020. At 31 December 2018, the provision set aside in respect of these disputes represented €1.1 million. ----- ###### 3.4.15. Provisions for employee benefits Share-based payment As indicated in the “Highlights of the period” section, a free share plan was set up by Foncia Stark on 23 May 2018. The main characteristics of the plan along with the accounting treatment applied are explained in Note 2.4. There are no stock option or free share plans in place at Foncia Management. Pensions and other post-employment benefits Short-term benefits Short-term benefits (wages and salaries, payroll taxes, paid leave, etc.) are expensed in the period in which the corresponding services are provided by the employee. Any amounts not paid at the end of the reporting period are carried in current liabilities. Post-employment benefits In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which the Group operates, Foncia participates in, or operates, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Virtually all of the Group’s employees are entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by the Foncia Group to the beneficiaries when the rights allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds funded in accordance with the applicable obligations and government regulations. - Defined contribution plans ###### Defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans are expensed as incurred in the statement of profit and loss. - Defined benefit plans ###### Defined benefit plans may be funded by investments in various instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds. Pension obligations and expenses are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. This method is based on assumptions that are reviewed on a yearly basis, including the probability that the employee will remain in the Group until retirement, expected future salary trends, life expectancy and an appropriate discount rate for each of the countries in which the Group operates a pension plan. The assumptions used in respect of 2018 are detailed in Note 4.12. A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position for the difference between the related projected benefit obligation (actuarial liability) and any plan assets as measured at fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses. Expenses under defined benefit plans comprise three components, accounted for as described below: - Service cost is recognised in personnel costs. It includes service cost for the period, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments, which are recognised in full in profit or loss for the period in which they arose, and gains and losses arising on plan settlements. - Interest cost is recognised in other financial income and expenses and reflects the impact of discounting the obligations, net of the expected return on plan assets as measured using the discount rate applied to calculate those obligations. ----- ###### - Gains and losses on remeasuring the benefit obligation (plan asset) are recognised in other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss, and essentially comprise actuarial gains and losses, i.e., changes in the benefit obligation and in plan assets attributable to changes in assumptions and experience adjustments. Experience adjustments represent the difference between the expected impact of certain actuarial assumptions applied to previous measurements of the obligation and actual experience. If plan assets exceed the benefit obligation, a financial asset is recorded up to the amount of the present value of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Other benefits: long-service awards In France, the collective bargaining agreement for the real estate industry stipulates that all active employees who so request are entitled to one month’s salary at every anniversary date: after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of professional experience. Professional experience is considered overall and not as experience solely within the Group. However, the Group is only liable for the amount proportionate to the employee’s seniority in the Group. The Group’s obligation under long-service awards is assessed each year by an independent expert. The assumptions used in respect of 2018 are detailed in Note 4.12. 3.4.16. Income tax Income tax for the period includes current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group calculates its current taxes in accordance with the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which its earnings are taxable. Current tax expense is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable profit. However, management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax authorities. Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on: - all temporary differences between the tax base and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, excluding ###### goodwill; - tax loss carryforwards. ###### Deferred tax is calculated based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability settled. Deferred tax assets arising on temporary differences or on tax losses and tax credits carried forward are only recognised to the extent it is probable that they will reverse and that the Group will generate future taxable profit against which they can be utilised. The following are taken into account when assessing the Group’s ability to recover these assets: - forecasts of future taxable earnings; - taxable earnings in previous years. ###### Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the entity has a right to set off a current tax asset against a current tax liability and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same tax entity or on different tax entities when there is an intention to settle the amounts on a net basis. ----- ###### In accordance with the CNC (Conseil National de la Comptabilité – former French accounting standards-setter) position statement published on 14 January 2010, the Group has used its judgement in determining how to treat the CVAE (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée) tax assessed on value added in France. The Group considers that since the base for the CVAE tax is the difference between income and expenses, the tax falls within the scope of IAS 12. Accordingly, the CVAE tax is included under “Income tax benefit (expense)”. 3.4.17. Current liabilities Current liabilities are liabilities to be settled or renegotiated within the ordinary operating cycle or within 12 months following the end of the reporting period. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts shown in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable estimates of their market value. The value of items that will be paid over the long term is discounted. 3.4.18. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities at fair value The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the end of the reporting period, either for accounting purposes or for disclosure in the notes. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. IFRS 13 sets out a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value: - Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or ###### liability, either directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., price-based inputs). - Level 3: inputs relating to the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable ###### inputs). The Group primarily uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, cash management financial assets and identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 4.18. 3.4.19. Assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations sets forth the accounting requirements applicable to assets held for sale, along with the presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations. A non-current asset or disposal group is held for sale when its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. The assets and liabilities concerned are reclassified in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, and no offsetting is permitted. Assets reclassified in this category are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their carrying amount, i.e., at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortisation and impairment losses, and are no longer depreciated/amortised. A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major line of business and meets the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale or has been sold by the Group. ----- ###### Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line in the statement of profit and loss for the periods presented, which shows post-tax profit or loss attributable to discontinued operations and the post-tax gain or loss on the disposal or the measurement to fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups comprising the discontinued operation. Similarly, cash flows attributable to discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods presented. A discontinued operation can also be defined as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and: ▪ represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; ▪ is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or ▪ is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 3.4.20. Presentation of the statement of profit and loss As allowed under IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements, the Group has chosen to present operating expenses by nature. “Recurring operating profit (loss)”, “Operating profit (loss)”, “Cost of gross debt” and “Cost of net debt” in the statement of profit and loss and gains and losses recognised directly in equity are presented in accordance with the criteria set out in ANC Recommendation No. 2013-03 issued by the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables). 3.4.21. Revenue Revenue corresponds to proceeds from sales of goods and services within the scope of the ordinary operations of fully consolidated companies. All revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes. In accordance with the new IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity, and specific criteria are met by each of the Group’s businesses. Negotiation fees and commission (sales and rentals) are recognised in revenue when they are received or effectively due at the end of the reporting period. Interest income arising on client funds is also booked in revenue. 3.4.22. Recurring operating profit (loss) Recurring operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, with the exception of items classified within “Non-recurring operating income (expenses)”. Recurring operating profit (loss) is a performance indicator that may serve as a method for estimating recurring performance. It includes all items included in operating profit (loss) restated for any non-recurring items. Costs relating to business combinations or restructuring are excluded from recurring operating profit (loss). 3.4.23. Non-recurring operating income (expenses) Non-recurring operating income and expenses are recorded if a major event occurs during the reporting period that could distort the interpretation of the entity’s performance. Non-recurring items are limited, unusual and/or irregular items of a material amount and are detailed in Note 5 8 ----- ###### 3.4.24. Operating profit (loss) Operating profit (loss) includes all income and expenses directly related to the Group’s businesses, irrespective of whether they are of a recurring nature or whether they result from one-off decisions or transactions. 3.4.25. Cost of net debt The cost of net debt is equal to all financial expenses on borrowings, less financial income from cash investments. 3.4.26. Earnings (loss) per share Earnings (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) attributable to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period (excluding treasury shares). 3.4.27. Segment reporting The Group is not concerned by IFRS 8 – Operating Segments. Revenue is broken down by business in Note 5.1. ----- ###### NOTE 4.

It should be noted that the process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisitions in 2020 of Yxime and Gérance de Passy was still in progress at 31 December 2020. Accordingly, the goodwill currently recognised is provisional. 4.1.2. 2020 impairment tests The assumptions used in the tests and the approach applied are described below. Impacts of IFRS 16 on the impairment testing approach IFRS 16 significantly overhauls the inputs used in impairment tests, including the net amount tested, debt and valuation multiples. It therefore requires entities to reconsider their testing approach. In this regard, several different approaches are consistently accepted by the regulators. The first, which complies with IAS 36, involves increasing the carrying amount of the CGU by the amount of the right-of-use asset, without taking into account the IFRS 16 lease liability. This approach represents a change of practice and introduces a degree of complexity into the calculation of value in use, since (i) cash flows relating solely to fixed lease payments or similar are excluded from the calculation insofar as they constitute the new lease liability, (ii) the cash outflows required to renew the right-of-use assets are to be estimated (future reinvestment flows affecting both the series of annual projections and the terminal value), and (iii) the discount rate is to be adjusted (estimated impact on the WACC of the new cost of capital/cost of debt ratio). The second approach is similar to the one described above and involves eliminating the lease liability from the carrying amount of the CGU and from the value in use. This approach leads to similar difficulties as those seen above. The third solution is to maintain the pre-IFRS 16 approach in terms of projecting future cash flows. Although the carrying amount of the CGU changes (increase in the value of the right-of-use asset net of the lease liability), the calculation of value in use is not affected:  projected cash outflows relating to lease payments remain unchanged for both the annual forecasts and for the terminal value;  the discount rate is determined by reference to pre-IFRS 16 inputs (no change in the cost of debt and the debt-to-equity ratio). The Group chose to maintain the third approach for its impairment tests in 2020. Calculation of the carrying amount of CGUs at 31 December 2020 Estimating the carrying amount of each CGU includes determining the value of the assets that may be directly attributed or reasonably allocated to the CGU and that will generate cash flows included in the calculation of value in use. However, the carrying amount does not include that of identified liabilities. In 2018, goodwill of €1,094.9 million arising on the acquisition of a controlling interest in Foncia Holding in September 2016 was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used within the scope of the purchase price accounting. ----- ###### Following the Group’s various acquisitions, goodwill allocated to each CGU can be analysed as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

It should be noted that all holding company expenses not allocated in the consolidated business plan were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU. Corporate functions are managed at individual country-level for the Property Management International CGU and are considered not material for the Services CGU. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated based on a sample of comparable European companies. A WACC was estimated for each foreign country and then for the entire Foncia Group based on a weighting of each country’s contribution to total EBITDA. On this basis, a single weighted discount rate of 8% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs. By way of reminder, a single weighted discount rate of 7.4% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs in 2019.

Assumptions relating to the health crisis and result of tests Although the health crisis represents a sudden, one-off event, it does not call the Group’s growth model into question.

Based on these expectations, the impacts of the Covid-19 health crisis on business levels and on the profitability of its different CGUs were mainly taken into account in 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021.

In March 2018, the Group purchased the 25% stake in Somhome that it did not already own for a total purchase price of €0.1 million, bringing its interest in this company to 100%. At 31 December 2017, a liability representing the put option granted to non-controlling shareholders had been carried in the statement of financial position in an amount of €0.6 million. This liability was written back against equity (see Note 4.11 “Net debt”). Lastly, on 30 November 2018 Primonial acquired a 40% equity interest in Leemo following a partial asset contribution consisting of its entire sales brokerage division for new and existing properties (see Note 2.3 of “Highlights of the period”). Consideration for this contribution amounting to €7 million took the form of preferred shares that do not meet the criteria for recognition as equity instruments. Accordingly, the contribution was recognised by default within financial liabilities. Ultimately, the transaction led to the reclassification of the negative amount of €0.4 million between non-controlling interests and equity attributable to owners of the parent.

GENERAL PRESENTATION Information concerning the Foncia Management Group Foncia Management is a French simplified joint stock company (société par actions simplifiée) with a sole shareholder, subject to all regulations governing commercial companies in France, and in particular the provisions of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Its registered office is located at 13 avenue Lebrun, 92160 Antony, France. Description of Group businesses Foncia Groupe is a European leader in residential property services. It assists its clients at all stages of the property life cycle, with a comprehensive, integrated service offering that includes management of jointly owned properties, round-the-clock assistance, rental management, rentals, sales, purchases, holiday lettings, appraisals, insurance, technical surveys and energy brokerage. Foncia operates in France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. Information presented Statutory 2017 consolidated financial statements The Foncia Management Group (the “Group”) comprising Foncia Management and its subsidiaries, was created on 7 September 2016 further to the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Foncia Holding group. The Group prepared its consolidated financial statements for the first time for the period ended 31 December 2017. These financial statements covered: - 20 months of operations for Foncia Management, from its creation in May 2016 to 31 December 2017; - 16 months of operations for the Foncia Holding group, from its acquisition by Foncia Management on ###### 7 September 2016 to 31 December 2017. Since this does not allow a meaningful comparison with results of operations for an equivalent 12-month period, profit and loss data for the period ended 31 December 2017 are not used as comparative data. They are included for information purposes under “2017 (presented)”. Pro forma 2017 consolidated financial statements The pro forma 2017 results of operations include 12 months of operations for Foncia Management and the Foncia Holding group. The main accounting policies applied are the same as those applied to prepare the statutory consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management. However, the Group applied IFRS 15 on revenue recognition and IFRS 9 on financial instruments for the first time in 2018. Accordingly, the first-time application impacts have been separated out for 2017 to enable a meaningful comparison. The consolidated results of operations for the period ended 31 December 2017 have been restated to reflect the application of these standards as if they had been applied from 1 January 2017. These restated figures appear throughout as “2017 (restated pro forma)”. 2018 consolidated financial statements The 2018 consolidated financial statements reflect the statutory financial statements and do not contain any pro forma restatements. They have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and ----- ###### interpretations (IAS/IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at 1 January 2018. Consequently, they include the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9. NOTE 2. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIOD External growth investments (acquisitions) and changes in the scope of consolidation The Group acquired 54 companies in the period, thereby continuing its acquisition-led growth. The companies concerned are mainly property management companies with the exception of Lodgis, whose furnished property rental business rounds out the Group’s commercial offering.

For the purposes of the sale, on 31 October 2019 management spun off Primaliance to recreate it as a subsidiary within Foncia Primaliance, transferring to it the entire amount of Primaliance business goodwill (transfer by REIP of the entire standalone Primaliance business to Foncia Primaliance with retroactive effect from 1 July 2019). Following the 1 August 2019 signing of an agreement in principle with a major asset manager in France and the subsequent confirmation by the third-party buyer of its interest in the operation, the parties signed the preliminary sale agreement on 6 March 2020. This agreement stipulates a provisional sale price of €4.6 million (plus the amount of net debt as of the date on which the deed of sale is signed), as well as contingent consideration of up to €0.5 million based on 2020 inflows. In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the Group presents Foncia Primaliance’s current and non-current assets and liabilities on a separate line of the statement of financial position. Its net assets held for sale were measured at their fair value based on a sale price of €5.8 million. The proceeds from the sale, along with the fair value adjustment to Foncia Primaliance’s net assets in the form of a write-down to goodwill, are included in non-recurring operating items (see Note 5.8):",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Details of the debt restructuring are presented below, it being specified that none of the terms and conditions negotiated in these restructuring transactions substantially modify the initial terms of the debt. Based on an analysis of the renegotiated terms and conditions, the initial debt therefore remains unchanged.  Increase in the amount able to be drawn down under the revolving credit facility up to €220 million An additional €70 million is now available for drawdown under the revolving credit facility, bringing the total amount of the facility (including the authorised overdraft) to €220 million. The applicable terms and conditions for the facility remain the same, except for the maturity of the line, which has been extended by six months (i.e., until 7 March 2023). It should be noted that the maturity of the revolving facility changes in line with the maturity of the senior facility (it will always mature six months before that facility) |Disposal of the Investor division Foncia Pierre Foncia Foncia Plus (€ thousands) Gestion Primaliance|2019| |---|---| |Shareholders’ equity 5 103 201 6 493 Goodwill 38 529 15 707 16 616 Remeasurement adjustments Of which trademarks 6 000 3 100 Of which client relationships 5 780 2 982 Of which deferred taxes on trademarks and client relationships ( 3 418) ( 1 762) Cancellation of the Primaliance merger deficit ( 5 100) Neutralisation of business goodwill net of tax ( 1 159) Other IFRS adjustments ( 94)|11 797 70 852 9 100 8 762 ( 5 180) ( 5 100) ( 1 159) ( 94)| |Total equity 50 741 15 908 22 329|88 979| |Final sale price 68 991 1 263 Provisional sale price 5 820|70 254 5 820| |Book capital gains and losses on disposals 18 250 ( 14 645)|3 605| ||| |IFRS 5 adjustment (goodwill impairment) ( 16 509)|( 16 509)| ||| |Total profit and loss impacts (excluding tax) 18 250 ( 14 645) ( 16 509)|( 12 905)| ----- ###### The fees for this operation represented €650,000. In accordance with IFRS 9, they will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method. At 31 December 2019, the revolving credit facility had been repaid in full.  Subscription of a new €178 million tranche under the senior facility This new line is intended to refinance the full amount drawn under the revolving credit facility as well as the debt restructuring fees. The applicable terms and conditions for this new tranche are closely aligned with those of the term loan B (3.25% interest, maturing September 2023). The fees for this operation represented €3.1 million. and will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method.  Extended availability of the capex facility This facility is now available until 7 September 2022 (compared to 7 September 2020 prior to the restructuring). However, the maturity of the facility remains unchanged and aligned with the maturity of the term loan B (i.e., 7 September 2023). At 31 December 2019, no amounts had been drawn down under the capex facility.  Other amendments to the banking documentation  Application of IFRS 16 to the Group’s financial reporting and financial covenants.  The free-and-clear (“freebie”) basket under the senior facility now covers €210 million compared to €100 million previously, or 1x EBITDA PF LTM.  The senior leverage ratio increased from 5.25x to 5.5x. On 31 July 2019, the Group repaid the full €110 million on the second-lien loan, as well as any accrued interest up to that date. This early repayment was funded by the subscription of an additional senior facility tranche for the same amount, i.e., €110 million. The fees for this operation represented €0.8 million and will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method. Acquisition of an additional stake in the Initiative et Partenaire sub-group On 27 March 2015, the Group had acquired a 45% stake in the property management company Initiative et Partenaire (a former Foncia franchisee) and eight of its subsidiaries for €2.2 million. According to the terms of this acquisition, the historic shareholders had retained a 55% stake but had undertaken to sell all of their remaining shares to the Foncia Group within a three-year period. Reciprocal put and call options had been granted in respect of this transaction. On 22 May 2019, the Group exercised its call option and thereby acquired the additional 55% stake in the company for €3.2 million. This acquisition of an additional interest in the Initiative et Partenaire sub-group led to the reclassification of a negative amount of €0.5 million between non-controlling interests and equity attributable to owners of the parent. Earn-out payment relating to the acquisition of shares in Esset Management (formerly FIPM) An earn-out of up to €3 million was granted to the Icade group at the time of the acquisition of Icade Property Management (now Esset Management) on 31 July 2016. The earn-out was based on trends in revenue earned by ESSET with Caisse des Dépôts. This maximum €3 million earn-out had been included in the calculation of goodwill as a component of the purchase price. The final earn-out was settled in February 2019 for an amount of €2.9 million. ----- ###### Acquisition of an additional stake in BimData.io (MovetoBim) On 9 July 2019, the Group acquired an additional stake in BimData.io (MovetoBim) through a capital increase subscribed by its subsidiary Immophilae in an amount of €0.3 million. The Group’s interest in BimData.io is now 19.25%. Given the difficulty in compiling and sharing pertinent information, MovetoBIM, a start-up based in Lyon (France) has revisited asset management using Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology, offering asset managers a fully digital, collaborative alternative solution. Since the end of 2015, the company has made available its online tools leveraging BIM technology, a new benchmark in building design. Change in accounting presentation for Leemo revenue Following the additional analyses carried out by the Group in connection with the first-time application of IFRS 15, in 2019 the Group decided to change its accounting presentation of revenue arising from fees earned on deeds of sale. This led to the reclassification of the contracts concerned as contracts where it acts as agent, as opposed to contracts where it acts as principal as was previously the case. Due to this change in accounting presentation, the Group now shows billed amounts net of the costs of fee retrocessions in order to present only those fees attributable to the Group. Since this does not allow a meaningful comparison of consolidated revenue (and the related external charges) between 2019 and 2018, the statement of profit and loss figures for 2018 have been restated accordingly, leading to a negative impact of €14.9 million on revenue as presented. This change in presentation has no impact on recurring operating profit for 2018. It should be recalled that in accordance with IFRS 15, when a third party is involved in providing a separate service, the Group must determine whether it acts on its own behalf (i.e., as principal) or on behalf of another party (i.e., as agent). The Group therefore has to determine whether it controls the specified service before it is provided to the end customer, (for example, when it controls the way in which the third party provides the service). The agent/principal distinction is explicitly based on the notion of control. Based on an analysis of the substance of the contractual relationship between Leemo and business providers/developers, and in particular Leemo’s lack of flexibility in setting its prices, the Group has decided that Leemo acts as agent. NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS General principles used to prepare the financial statements The accounting policies described in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the standards adopted as described in Note 3.2.2, effective as of 1 January 2019, which include IFRS 16 c Leases. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for assets held for sale and related liabilities, measured in accordance with IFRS 5, and certain financial instruments carried at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9. The consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management at 31 December 2019 were adopted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting of 23 April 2020 and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the General Meeting on 29 June 2020. They are presented in thousands of euros and amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest thousand unless otherwise specified. Consequently, the sum of these amounts may differ slightly from the total amounts reported. ----- ###### Accounting standards 3.2.1. Basis of preparation of financial information Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 297/2008 of 11 March 2008, the 2019 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at 1 January 2019. The full text of the standards adopted by the European Union can be consulted on the European Commission’s website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting_en Where there is no specific guidance from IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations, the Group refers to other IFRS standards dealing with similar issues or to the Conceptual Framework, in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. At the end of the reporting period, there was no difference between the IFRS used to prepare these financial statements and the standards adopted by the IASB and applicable for the period presented. The accounting policies and bases of measurement applied to prepare these consolidated financial statements are described in Note 3.4 below. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Foncia Management, the entities it controls (subsidiaries) and the entities which are accounted for by the equity method. The financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared over the same period as those of the parent company, i.e., 1 January to 31 December 2019, using consistent accounting policies. 3.2.2. Changes in accounting standards Main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations in force within the European Union and mandatorily applicable since 1 January 2019 The accounting policies and bases of measurement used by the Group to prepare its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 are identical to those used by the Group at 31 December 2018, except as described below. - IFRS 16 – Leases ###### This new standard entered into force on 1 January 2019 and introduces fundamental changes to lease accounting. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations. It no longer distinguishes between operating leases and finance leases. Accordingly, entities are required to recognise all lease obligations in their statement of financial position in line with the approach applicable to finance leases under IAS 17. More specifically, on entering into a lease contract, IFRS 16 requires recognition in the statement of financial position of a liability representing the present value of future fixed lease payments, against a right-of-use asset depreciated over the term of the lease (these rights and obligations were previously reported in off-balance sheet commitments for operating leases). The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information. Under this approach, a liability is recognised at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. ----- ###### All impacts resulting from the first-time application of IFRS 16 were recognised against opening equity at 1 January 2019. The Group does not have any major lease contracts in which it acts as lessor, with the exception of certain intragroup leases, the accounting for which was not significantly impacted by IFRS 16. The amount of the lease liability is largely dependent on the assumptions used to determine the lease term and, to a lesser extent, the discount rate.  Under IFRS 16, the discount rate for each lease is to be determined by reference to the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. In practice, given how the Group is organised financially, i.e., held or guaranteed almost exclusively by the three French holding companies, the Group adopted an incremental borrowing rate of 3.25% for all of its lease contracts (excluding vehicle leases), reflecting the Group’s own borrowing rate. This rate corresponds to the sum of the risk-free rate and the Group’s credit spread over the initial term of the syndicated loan (i.e., without considering the term). The value of the vehicle fleet in France is estimated based on the interest rate implicit in the leases, as supplied by Arval, i.e., 2.56%.  Barring exceptional cases, the lease term reflects the firm term of the lease, plus or minus the period covered by any extension or early termination options. For property leases in France and in particular automatically renewable property leases, the Group has adopted the legally defensible term of the lease, which reflects the nearest date at which the lease can be terminated without incurring any penalties, taking into account a six-month notice period starting at the end of the calendar quarter (i.e., a maximum nine-month term). The lease term is therefore nine months at the date of first-time application of IFRS 16 and six months at the date of preparation of the 2019 financial statements. It should be noted that following its meeting of 26 November 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) confirmed its position regarding the lease term and useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements. IFRS IC confirms that the economics of a lease contract rather than just its legal form should be used to determine the enforceable term of a lease. Owing to the late publication of this decision and the time needed to analyse and modify the corresponding estimates, this decision will be applied by the Group in 2020 (the legal approach was maintained to determine the term of property leases). The following other main assumptions and practical expedients were used by the Group:  Leases formerly classified as finance leases under IAS 17 continue to be accounted for as finance leases. To simplify, the residual useful life of these leases is calculated in the same way as under IAS 17.  The practical expedient exempting leases with a residual term of less than 12 months from the scope of IFRS 16 has not been adopted by the Group.  Restoration costs - Property leases: restoration costs are not calculated for property leases. As they are frequently negotiated with the lessor at the end of the lease, the costs cannot be reliably estimated. - Vehicle fleet: In France, the Group adopted an average cost of €700 per vehicle (cost plus 20% for private vehicles on which VAT cannot be recovered) in measuring the right-of-use asset corresponding to the residual value guarantee. This average cost was calculated based on a market estimate and taking into account the historical cost actually incurred when changing the automotive fleet at the beginning of 2019.  Variable lease payments or services related to the lease are not included when calculating the amount of the right-of-use asset or lease liability.  Deferred tax was recognised on the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability falling within the scope of IFRS 16, in a similar way to that previously recognised for finance leases.  The useful lives of non-removable leasehold improvements have not been aligned with the useful lives of the related right-of-use assets ----- ###### The Group has a large number of leases across its entire French and international branch network. Its leases are of many different types, but are mainly leases of property or vehicles.

However, while payments under operating leases were previously shown within cash flows from (used in) operating activities in accordance with IAS 17, lease payments under IFRS 16 are now to be split between cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability and cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability. |Impact of IFRS 16 on the consolidated statement of profit and loss (€ thousands)|2019| |---|---| |Neutralisation of rental expenses on property leases France Switzerland Belgium Germany Neutralisation of rent-free periods on property leases Neutralisation of rental expenses on the vehicle fleet Neutralisation of provisions for reconditioning vehicles Neutralisation of rental expenses on photocopiers and other Depreciation of right-of-use assets|36,605 31,759 3,529 348 969 (789) 2,789 254 1,268 (40,403)| |Impact on consolidated recurring operating profit (loss)|(276)| |Neutralisation of non-recurring rental expenses on property leases Net impact of lease terminations and reductions in the lease scope|2,359 (72)| |Impact on consolidated non-recurring operating items|2,287| |Interest on lease liabilities|(3,905)| |Impact on consolidated net profit (loss) before tax|(1,894)| |Impact of IFRS 16 on the presentation of cash flows (€ thousands)|2019|Property leases Vehicle fleet Photocopiers Other| |---|---|---| |Impact on consolidated recurring operating profit (loss) Elimination of right-of-use asset depreciation|(276) 40,403 (254) 366 (121) 487 2,359|(436) 98 61 1 36,389 2,828 1,125 62 (254) 291 75 3 ( 2) (196) 75 3 ( 2) 487 2,359| |Elimination of provisions for reconditioning vehicles Impact of change in working capital requirement Of which neutralisation of changes in prepaid rental expenses Of which neutralisation of provisions for rent-free periods Neutralisation of non-recurring rental expenses on property leases||| |Impact on cash flows from (used in) operating activities|42,598|38,602 (2,747) 1,189 60| |Repayment of lease liabilities Net interest paid|(38,693) (3,905)|(34,847) (2,671) (1,118) (57) (3,755) (76) (71) (3)| |Impact on cash flows from (used in) financing activities|(42,598)|(38,602) (2,747) (1,189) (60)| ----- ###### In accordance with IFRS 16, repayment of the principal of the lease liability is included within cash flows from (used in) financing activities. Interest paid on the lease liability is also included within cash flows from (used in) financing activities, as allowed by IAS 7 and in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Consequently, net cash from operating activities for 2019 was €42.6 million higher than in 2018, while net cash used in financing activities increased by the same amount. Statement of financial position The new requirements under IFRS 16 lead to an increase in reported assets and liabilities. The recognition of right-of-use assets increases non-current assets by €131.5 million, while the recognition of lease liabilities increases total liabilities by €127.9 million, including a non-current portion of €94.7 million and a current portion of €33.3 million. The Group has chosen to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities separately from its other assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. - IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments ###### The Group has applied IFRIC 23 since 1 January 2019 and has therefore reviewed its uncertain income tax treatments. No impact was identified on the estimated amount of income taxes. - Amendment to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation - Amendment to IAS 28 – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures - Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2015-2017 cycle - Amendment to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement ###### The first-time application of these standards, amendments and interpretations does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Other new standards and guidance applicable after 31 December 2019 and not early adopted by the Group - IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material - Amendment to IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business - Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards ###### These standards and amendments have been adopted or are in the process of being adopted by the European Union. Subject to their adoption, they are applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. The Group is currently analysing the potential impacts of applying the requirements set out in these texts for the first time. ----- ###### Use of management estimates in applying the Group’s accounting standards The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the measurement and presentation of certain assets and liabilities and any disclosures provided in respect of contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given the circumstances. These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Where applicable, a sensitivity analysis may be performed if the estimates are material. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates made by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below.  Measurements used in testing goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. As with any estimate, the assumptions used in these calculations are partly based on uncertain factors and may therefore need to be adjusted in subsequent periods. Note 4.1.3 sets out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same note.  Measurement of leases IFRS 16 requires entities to use a significant degree of judgement as well as certain key estimates. These involve determining:  whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised;   the lease term;  the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments;   the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the contract. The main assumptions used by the Group to prepare its 2019 financial statements are described in Note 3.2.2.  Measurement of provisions The Group used the best estimate of its commitments and obligations to calculate the corresponding provisions.  Measurement of employee benefits The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. Note 4.13 sets out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. ----- ######  Measurement of fair value (Level 1) The Group uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure unlisted derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents (see Notes 3.4.17 and 4.18).  Measurement of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax expense The Group’s tax position (see Notes 4.9 and 5.11) is based on its best estimate of future taxable earnings.  Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount.  Assessment of criteria for identifying discontinued operations In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the Group is required to exercise judgement in determining whether an asset or group of assets meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. IFRS 5 criteria are also used to identify any assets to be classified as discontinued operations. These assessments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in light of changes in the relevant facts and circumstances. In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, the Group uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements:  present a true and fair view of the Foncia Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows;  reflect the economic substance of transactions;  are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects. Detailed disclosures in this regard are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Basis of measurement 3.4.1. Basis of consolidation Details of the main consolidated companies at 31 December 2019 are provided in Note 13 “Scope of consolidation”. Controlled entities Companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or is entitled, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity in question and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Control is analysed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the inputs used to assess control has changed. A subsidiary is consolidated as from the date control is acquired, which is usually upon signature of the share transfer and disposal agreements (see “Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period” below). Consolidation ceases when control is relinquished. Any interest in the subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recognised within non-controlling interests. Profits and losses and each component of other comprehensive income relating to subsidiaries are allocated to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. ----- ###### Changes in the percentage interest held in subsidiaries that do not lead to a change in control are treated as equity transactions, since the transactions take place between owners acting in their capacity as owners. The impact of these transactions is shown in equity net of tax and does not therefore impact consolidated profit or loss. These transactions are also shown in the statement of cash flows under cash flows relating to investing activities. Investments in equity-accounted companies (associates and joint ventures) Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s interest in the profits, losses and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments is applied to determine whether investments in associates or joint ventures need to be tested for impairment. Where necessary, the total carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets. Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period Non-consolidated investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and mainly consist of shares in property management companies that will subsequently be consolidated. Before acquiring shares in a property management company, the Group agrees to acquire the shares and pays 10% of the estimated price to the seller. This part payment is included in “Downpayments on acquisitions of securities” within non-current financial assets. The remaining 90% is booked in “Off-balance sheet commitments” (see Note 9). Upon signing the share transfer or disposal agreement, the Group pays an additional 70% of the estimated price to the seller. The provisional purchase price is then included in equity investments, and the part payment already recognised is also reclassified to this caption. The acquired company is then consolidated. Following a review of the acquired company’s financial statements, the Group pays the remaining balance and adjusts the purchase price of the shares. Non-consolidated investments Companies with the following characteristics are not included in the scope of consolidation:  they are in the process of being wound up or are dormant;  their business is not strategic for the Group. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-consolidated investments are carried at fair value. There are no material obligations or liabilities relating to these entities. ----- ###### 3.4.2. Elimination of intragroup transactions All intragroup transactions and balances as well as any income, expenses, gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions and included in the carrying amount of assets are eliminated on consolidation. When a Group entity carries out a transaction with a joint venture or associate, the related gains and losses are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the interests held by third parties in the joint venture or associate. 3.4.3. Foreign currency translation Presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Functional currency and translation of the financial statements of foreign companies A consolidated entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the local currency. However, certain entities must adopt a functional currency other than their local currency when that currency represents the currency of the major transactions carried out by the entity and accurately reflects its economic environment. The financial statements of foreign entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are translated using the “closing rate” method, as follows:  assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate;  statement of profit and loss and cash flow items are converted at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting currency translation differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income within equity under “Translation adjustments”. Goodwill relating to foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro are treated as assets acquired or liabilities assumed and therefore translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. As the Group does most of its business in the eurozone, only its Swiss subsidiaries prepare financial statements in a currency other than the euro. The following exchange rates were used to prepare the consolidated financial statements: 2019 2018 Equivalent to €1 Closing rate Average rate Opening rate Closing rate Average rate Opening rate CHF Swiss franc 1.0952 1.1138 1.1295 1.1295 1.1564 1.1643 ###### The exchange rates used are the rates published by the Banque de France. ----- ###### Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedged rate. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the closing exchange rate, with the resulting gains and losses included in foreign exchange gains and losses under other financial income and expenses in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined. Loans granted to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in that foreign operation. Translation adjustments arising on monetary items that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (equity) under “Foreign currency translation reserves”, and taken to profit or loss when the net investment is sold. 3.4.4. Business combinations and goodwill The Group uses the purchase method to account for its acquisitions of subsidiaries. The fair value of the consideration transferred reflects the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed or incurred by the acquirer at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed in the period in which they were incurred. On the first-time consolidation of a subsidiary or equity investment, the Group measures all identifiable items acquired at their acquisition-date fair value. The items are measured in the currency of the acquired company. In the event of deferred settlements, the future amounts payable are discounted to present value at the settlement date. The discount rate used is the same as that used to estimate the value of the assets. Fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities resulting from business combinations accounted for on a provisional basis (i.e., because the independent appraisals or ongoing additional analyses are incomplete) are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within 12 months of the acquisition (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Adjustments made after the measurement period are taken directly to profit or loss, unless they are made to correct an error, including in relation to deferred tax assets which, if recognised more than 12 months after the acquisition date, generate tax income. Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of “Investments in equity-accounted companies”. Goodwill The residual difference representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as goodwill. For each business combination, the Group may choose to account for non-controlling interests: - either at acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of goodwill on the non-controlling interests ###### (“full goodwill” method); - or based on the share of net identifiable assets of the acquired entity measured at fair value, in which case ###### goodwill is only recognised on the portion attributable to owners of the parent (“partial goodwill” method). ----- ###### Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that it may be impaired. The impairment testing approach is described in Note 3.4.8 “Impairment of assets” below. Impairment recognised against goodwill may not be reversed. Bargain purchases When the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired company exceeds the purchase price plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company, the negative goodwill is taken immediately to profit or loss in the period of the acquisition, after verifying the procedure for identifying and measuring the various items included in its calculation. Transactions involving non-controlling interests Changes in non-controlling interests that do not result in gain or loss of control are recognised in equity. In particular, when additional shares are acquired in an entity already controlled by the Group, the difference between the purchase price of the shares and the additional share of consolidated equity acquired is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the parent. The consolidated carrying amount of the subsidiary’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including goodwill) remains unchanged. Contingent consideration and/or earn-out Contingent consideration or earn-outs relating to a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair value, even if it deemed unlikely they will be paid. After the acquisition date, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration/earn-outs result in an adjustment to goodwill only if they are made within the 12 months following the acquisition date (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. In all other cases, any such changes are taken to profit or loss, unless the consideration transferred is an equity instrument. The revised IFRS 3 gives certain indications as regards the accounting for contingent payment arrangements with employees or selling shareholders. These arrangements may be part of the business combination or may be considered as separate from the acquisition agreement for the target entity. In certain acquisitions, earn-out payments were considered part of the consideration for post-acquisition services rendered and are therefore expensed in the periods concerned and in future periods. Business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisitions) In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss on the date control was obtained. Goodwill at the date control is obtained is calculated as the fair value of consideration transferred (i.e., price paid) plus the fair value of the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company. 3.4.5. Intangible assets Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets with no physical substance. In accordance with IAS 38, intangible assets that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost when the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is included as part of the cost of those assets only if it increases the future economic benefits associated with the assets concerned. Other costs are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that can be reliably measured, are controlled by the Group, and are separable or arise from legal or contractual rights are recognised at fair value separately from goodwill. ----- ###### Intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite useful life (software and licences) are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives: - Client relationships: 18-21 years - Software programs: 1-10 years - Other intangible assets: 5 years ###### Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. They are included with other assets within cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment using the discounted cash flow method at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. When the recoverable amount of these assets calculated based on criteria prevailing at the acquisition date falls below their carrying amount, an impairment provision is recorded. Trademarks Identifiable trademarks are measured using a multi-criteria approach that takes into consideration both their reputation and profitability. The Group classified its main “Foncia” trademark, along with the “Lodgis” and “Trévi” trademarks in Belgium and the “Domicim” and “Brolliet” trademarks in Switzerland, as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Business software programs Software acquired is carried at cost (purchase price plus ancillary expenses). When allocating the purchase price, certain software programs may also be measured using the replacement cost approach. Business goodwill and client relationships Client relationships include the list of mandates held by the Group’s companies. A mandate is an instrument by which a person (the principal) gives another person (the agent) the power to carry out or enter into one or more legal actions or agreements, in the principal’s name. France’s Hoguet law requires professional property agents to hold a written mandate in order to put properties up for sale or to let, and to manage jointly owned property. Client relationships are measured based on the excess earnings method. ----- ###### Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly comprise the cost of acquiring new business. Leasehold rights In light of the legal characteristics of commercial leases in France, leasehold rights (droits au bail) are considered to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. They were previously shown within intangible assets and are now included within right-of-use assets (see Note 3.2.2). The residual value of right-of-use assets is reviewed at least once a year. Assets for which the underlying leases have been terminated are systematically retired. 3.4.6. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including customs duties and non-recoverable taxes, and any costs directly incurred to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the purchase price. Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment or is recognised as a separate component where appropriate, if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. All other maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs incurred to increase productivity or extend the useful life of an asset, which are capitalised. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the components approach over their estimated useful lives, taking into account any residual value. Straight-line depreciation is considered the method that best reflects the pattern in which the assets’ economic benefits are consumed by the Group: - Buildings: 20-50 years - Fixtures and fittings: 8-10 years - IT equipment: 4 years - Vehicle fleet: 5 years - Furniture: 10 years - Office equipment: 4 years ###### The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted where necessary. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there is evidence that they may be impaired. Gains and losses on asset disposals are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset concerned. 3.4.7. Leases Pursuant to IFRS 16 – Leases, on entering into a contract, the Group analyses the contractual provisions to determine whether it has the characteristics of a lease. It verifies whether the lease transfers in substance the right to control the use of an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. If these characteristics exist, as soon as the asset is made available the Group recognises:  a right-of-use asset, which represents its right to use the leased asset over the lease term;  a lease liability which represents its obligation to make lease payments ----- ###### The Group applies the same method to account for all leases in which it acts as lessee, and has chosen not to use the practical expedients set out in IFRS 16 exempting short-term leases (i.e., leases with terms of 12 months or less) or leases of low-value underlying assets from the scope of the standard. The amount of the right-of-use asset comprises:  the amount of the associated lease liability;  plus:  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,  any initial direct costs incurred to obtain the lease,  any estimated restoration costs to be incurred by the Group;  less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. They are depreciated over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset for accounting purposes, whichever is shorter. The lease liability represents the present value of:  fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date;  amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;  the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option;  penalties required for terminating the lease. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. To determine the lease term, the Group analyses the contractual provisions of the lease, as illustrated below: ----- ###### The Group remeasures the lease liability (and adjusts the corresponding right-of-use asset accordingly), when:  there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate;  there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate;  there is a change in the lease contract (lease modification) that is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. When the Group incurs an obligation to restore the asset to the condition specified in the lease contract, the related costs are included as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability is increased accordingly. IFRS 16 offers a practical expedient to lessees whereby they may choose not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group did not apply this practical expedient in its 2019 financial statements. 3.4.8. Impairment of assets Impairment of assets with finite useful lives Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment whenever there is evidence that they may be impaired. Impairment recognised in profit or loss against property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be reversed. Impairment of assets with indefinite useful lives Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that they may be impaired. Cash-generating units For the purposes of these impairment tests, non-current assets that cannot be tested individually for impairment as they do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, are grouped into cash-generating units (CGUs). Impairment tests are carried out on each CGU or group of CGUs at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets for internal management purposes. The CGUs identified by the Group correspond to its major development and investment strategies. The Group has defined the following three cash-generating units: - Property Management France CGU, which includes the management of jointly owned properties, rental ###### management, lettings, the transactions business and client mandates. - Property Management International CGU, which includes the property management and transactions ###### businesses in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium. ----- - Services CGU, which includes Constatimmo (brokerage for technical surveys), Assurimo (insurance ###### brokerage), Efficity (property appraisals website), FPM and Esset Management (BtoB property management), Prowen (brokerage specialised in energy purchases), Seiitra (property management software development), Techway (technical maintenance), Leemo (property platform), and Lodgis (furnished rentals). The Group decides whether or not to recognise an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities in a CGU or group of CGUs with their recoverable amount. Impairment indicators External indicators of impairment include changes in the general economic and financial environment, downtrends in local economic environments and changes in economic performance. These are analysed by the Group to determine whether the assets concerned should be tested for impairment more frequently. Method used to determine the recoverable amount An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of: - its fair value less the costs of disposal, representing the amount at which the Group could sell the asset (after ###### selling costs) in an arm’s length transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and - its value in use, representing the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the ###### continuing use and ultimate sale of an asset or CGU based on the most probable assumptions adopted by management. Fair value net of the costs of disposal is calculated based on available information used to establish the best estimate of the selling price net of costs to sell in an arm’s length transaction between fully informed, consenting parties. Value in use of CGUs or groups of CGUs is determined based on post-tax cash flows resulting from business plans and a terminal value calculated by extrapolating data for the last year of the business plan. The assumptions used are based on the budgets and business plans prepared by management for each business. These budgets are the latest budgets approved by the Supervisory Board at the date of preparation of the financial statements. Other assumptions affecting the calculation of the recoverable amount include the growth rate, operating margin, the discount rate and the tax rate (see Note 4.1). The discount rate used to discount post-tax cash flows to their present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Where there is no specific discount rate for the assets tested, the average cost of capital is used. The discount rates are post-tax rates and are applied to post-tax cash flows. The recoverable amount calculated using post-tax discount rates is equal to that which would have been obtained using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36. Recognition of impairment losses If the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the related assets are written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and then to the carrying amount of the other assets of the CGU, in proportion to their carrying amount. This must not result in the carrying amount of an individual asset falling below the higher of its fair value, value in use and zero. Impairment losses are recognised in other operating expenses and may not be reversed. ----- ###### Reversal of impairment losses Impairment losses recognised against goodwill cannot be reversed. Impairment losses recognised against assets other than goodwill may only be reversed if there is evidence that the impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist. The amount reversed is then based on revised estimates of the asset’s recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to the reversal of an impairment loss should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset. 3.4.9. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially carried at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment losses recorded in the statement of profit and loss. 3.4.10. Financial instruments The measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities is defined by IFRS 9 – Financial instruments. Financial assets Financial assets include loans and receivables, liquid assets, financial assets relating to financing, other financial assets, derivative instruments with a positive fair value and cash and cash equivalents. IFRS 9 applies a single analytical framework to all financial assets in order to determine the classification and basis of measurement to be used for accounting purposes. More specifically:  Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets that will be recovered through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) are generally carried at amortised cost. Financial assets at amortised cost include operating financial assets, other loans and receivables and trade receivables. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest rate method. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets at amortised cost are written down by the amount of any expected credit losses. The impairment loss is recorded either in recurring operating profit or in other financial income and expenses.  Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reclassifiable to profit or loss Financial assets that will be recovered both through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) and through sales of those assets are generally carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, with the exception of interest income and dividends, which are included in other financial income and expenses. Changes in fair value are reclassified to profit or loss when the assets are sold.  Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss This category includes investments in non-consolidated companies and equity instruments that the Group has irrevocably elected to classify in this category. When these investments are sold, the unrealised gains and losses previously carried in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss; only dividends will be taken to profit or loss. Fair value corresponds to the market price for listed securities or to the estimated fair value for unlisted securities, as determined according to the financial criteria most appropriate to the particular situation of each investment. Equity investments for which prices are not quoted on an active market and for which fair ----- ###### value cannot be reliably measured are carried by the Group at historical cost less any accumulated impairment losses.  Assets at fair value through profit or loss All other debt and equity instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. These include marketable securities with an underlying term of more than three months, other financial assets held for trading and purchased for sale in the near term, and financial instruments with a positive fair value that are not eligible for hedge accounting. These assets are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value taken to financial income and expenses. At the acquisition date, the Group determines the classification of financial assets into one of the IFRS 9 categories based on the characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing the assets. The table below provides an overview of classification by financial asset category, along with the corresponding measurement approach:",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The final goodwill allocation was completed in 2018. Goodwill was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used within the scope of the purchase price accounting. The portion of goodwill allocated to the businesses sold (Foncia Pierre Gestion and Foncia Plus) or in the process of sale (Foncia Primaliance) was measured based on the businesses’ contribution to 2016 EBITDA for the Services division, taking into account an initial allocation of €267.8 million for the Services CGU. Goodwill relating to Foncia Primaliance was written down in an amount of €16.5 million over the period following the remeasurement of net assets held for sale at fair value. This operation is described in the “Highlights of the year” section in Note 2.2.2. The final allocation of the Lodgis purchase price led to the recognition on the statement of financial position of a trademark of €2.3 million, software of €1.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of €1 million, recorded against an adjustment to goodwill in an amount of €2.9 million. |Newly Goodwill Deconsolidated Translation Assets classified 31 Dec. 2018 consolidated Impairment Other changes (€ thousands) companies adjustments as held for sale companies|31 Dec. 2019| |---|---| |Final goodwill relating to Foncia Management 1,094,913 (Sept. 2016) Of which allocated to Property Management CGU 784,200 Of which allocated to Services CGU 267,800 Of which allocated to International CGU 42,913 2016 post-deal acquisitions 43,589 2016 earn-out (620) 2017 acquisitions 36,123 2017 earn-out 251 2018 acquisitions 81,935|| |Total goodwill at 31 December 2018 1,256,190|1,256,190| |FONCIA SAINT ANDRE 36,039 AXIUM 24,250 GRIBI 17,070 SNC GARDIE ET ASSOCIES 9,065 OTIM IMMOBILIER 6,392 H IMMO 5,121 BOURGEOIS IMMOBILIER 4,710 FONCIA BAUTRA GMBH 3,649 Other (< €2m) 36,449|36,039 24,250 17,070 9,065 6,392 5,121 4,710 3,649 36,449| |Newly consolidated companies in 2019 1,256,190 142,745 0 0 0 0|1,398,935| |Outstanding purchase price balance on newly 1,879 consolidated companies in 2018 Derecognition of Foncia Pierre Gestion (38,529) Derecognition of Foncia Plus (15,707) Reclassification of Foncia Primaliance as held for sale (IFRS 5) (16,509) (107) Allocation of Lodgis remeasurement adjustments (2,941) ITA adjustment 190 Translation adjustment 1,359|1,879 (38,529) (15,707) (16,616) (2,941) 190 1,359| |Total goodwill at 31 December 2019 1,256,190 144,624 (54,236) (16,509) 1,359 (107) (2,751)|1,328,569| |Of which Property Management CGU 884,897 122,745 (38,529) (2,751) Of which Services CGU 312,518 (15,707) (16,509) (107) Of which International CGU 58,776 21,879 1,359|966,362 280,195 82,014| |Total goodwill at 31 December 2019 1,256,190 144,624 (54,236) (16,509) 1,359 (107) (2,751)|1,328,569| ----- ###### 4.1.2. 2019 impairment tests The assumptions used in the tests and the approach applied are described below. Impacts of IFRS 16 on the impairment testing approach IFRS 16 introduces significant changes to the inputs used in impairment tests, including the net amount tested, debt and valuation multiples. It therefore requires entities to reconsider their testing approach. In this regard, several different approaches have been proposed by the regulators to assist entities in their transition to IFRS 16. The first, which complies with IAS 36, involves increasing the carrying amount of the CGU by the amount of the right-of-use asset, without taking into account the IFRS 16 lease liability. This approach represents a change of practice and introduces a degree of complexity into the calculation of value in use, since (i) cash flows relating solely to fixed lease payments or similar are excluded from the calculation insofar as they constitute the new lease liability, (ii) the cash outflows required to renew the right-of-use assets are to be estimated (future reinvestment flows affecting both the series of annual projections and the terminal value), and (iii) the discount rate is to be adjusted (estimated impact on the WACC of the new cost of capital/cost of debt ratio). The second approach is similar to the one described above and involves eliminating the lease liability from the carrying amount of the CGU and from the value in use. This approach leads to similar difficulties as those seen above. The third solution is to maintain the pre-IFRS 16 approach in terms of projecting future cash flows. Although the carrying amount of the CGU changes (increase in the value of the right-of-use asset net of the lease liability), the calculation of value in use is not affected: - projected cash outflows relating to lease payments remain unchanged for both the annual forecasts and for the terminal value; - the discount rate is determined by reference to pre-IFRS 16 inputs (no change in the cost of debt and the debt-to-equity ratio). As the practical complexity of the first two approaches could undermine the reliability of the calculations (insufficient hindsight regarding the adjustment of certain cash flow inputs), the Group chose to use the third approach for its impairment tests in 2019. Calculation of the carrying amount of CGUs at 31 December 2019 Estimating the carrying amount of each CGU includes determining the value of the assets that may be directly attributed or reasonably allocated to the CGU and that will generate cash flows included in the calculation of value in use. Goodwill of €1,094.9 million arising on the acquisition of a controlling interest in Foncia Holding in September 2016 (see Note 4.1.1 above) was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used within the scope of the purchase price accounting. The goodwill allocation resulted in the following: |Property Holding International Goodwill - €m Management Services CGU companies CGU France CGU Goodw ill (Foncia Management PPA) 1,094.9 784.2 42.9 267.8 Allocation resulting from DCF/CGU at 30 Sept. 2016 71.6% 3.9% 24.5%|Consolidated 1,094.9 100.0%| |---|---| |Total goodwill 784 43 268|1,095| ----- ###### For intangible assets identified during the purchase price accounting for Foncia Holding and subsequent material acquisitions, the allocation at 31 December 2019 is as follows (based on the carrying amount): • Property Management France CGU: €354.7 million to the Foncia trademark and €333.7 million to client relationships; • Property Management International CGU: €21.6 million to the Brolliet, Domicim and Trévi trademarks and €7.5 million to client relationships; • Services CGU: €41.6 million to the Foncia trademark and €42.9 million to client relationships. The holding company’s residual economic assets following the asset allocation shown above were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU to reflect the cost allocation of the holding company used to draw up the business plans. Calculation of the recoverable amount of CGUs at 31 December 2019 In accordance with the Group’s impairment testing approach (see Note 3.4.7), and in the absence of observable fair values in an organised market, the recoverable amount of CGUs corresponds to their value in use, which is defined as the sum of their net cash flows based on the latest forecasts for each CGU, determined using:  a business plan prepared by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performance, forecast changes in the economic environment, and expected market trends;  a terminal value calculated by capitalising normative cash flows obtained by extrapolating cash flows from the final year of the business plan, with a stable growth rate or a growth rate increasing steadily over the long term;  expected cash flows discounted at a rate determined by reference to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The financial forecasts used in the impairment tests carried out at 31 December 2019 were prepared by management and cover a period of six years. They provide a consolidated view as well as a breakdown by CGU. It should be noted that all holding company expenses not allocated in the consolidated business plan were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU. Corporate functions are managed at individual country-level for the Property Management International CGU and are considered not material for the Services CGU. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated based on a sample of comparable European companies. A WACC was estimated for each foreign country, with the impacts of IFRS 16 eliminated ##### among the sample companies in order to obtain a pre-IFRS 16 segment financial structure. A WACC was then ###### calculated for the entire Foncia Group based on a weighting of each country’s contribution to total EBITDA. On this basis, a single weighted discount rate of 7.4% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The list of consolidated companies is presented in Note 13. External growth investments represented a total of €113.2 million in 2018 (securities and business goodwill), of which €108.2 million has been disbursed and €5 million recognized in current liabilities in respect of the outstanding purchase price balances. Additional goodwill arising on these acquisitions represents €81.1 million (see Note 4.1). Efficity In April 2018, the outstanding balance of the initial earn-out negotiated at the time of the Efficity acquisition in 2015 was allocated to its historic founders and managers in an amount of €4.5 million (€5.2 million had already been paid in 2017). To secure the founders’ and managers’ loyalty and their commitment to Efficity’s future development, the Group entered into a new agreement with them using a specific legal structure based on the creation of an intermediate holding company (Foncia Saturne) controlling Efficity’s entire share capital. The Group offered the aforementioned founders and key managers the possibility of reinvesting part of the proceeds from this earn-out in the holding company’s capital increase carried out for a total of €7 million (the historic founders invested €3 million, while the Group contributed €4 million). This reinvestment gives the founders the opportunity to realise a potential capital gain at the end of a four-year period, depending on future trends in the company’s operating performance. ----- ###### In light of the terms and conditions of the transaction driven by the Group’s interests, the acquisition was accounted for as an extension of the initial earn-out clause. The value of the initial earn-out was therefore recalculated (to the extent of the €3 million reinvested by the founders) at the date the new agreement was signed. ➢ Since the partner-founders are exposed to the risk that they may lose the capital invested if the “bad leaver” clause applies, non-recurring income of €3 million was recognized in the period. This income reflects the remeasurement of the initial earn-out liability (from €4.5 million to €1.5 million). ➢ Efficity continues to be fully consolidated, since the Group intends to retain sole control of the entity upon completion of the transaction. Leemo/Primonial partial asset contribution Overview of the transaction The Primonial and Foncia groups set up Leemo, a joint venture, to pool their respective skills and resources in terms of listing new and existing properties via their digital platform. On 30 November 2018, Primonial acquired a 40% equity interest in Leemo (the percentage interest is subject to change depending on certain criteria owing to the preferred shares issued in consideration of the contribution – see below) through a partial asset contribution consisting of Primonial’s entire, stand-alone sales brokerage division for new and existing properties. A 10-year shareholders’ agreement was signed with the Primonial group. Consideration for the contribution Based on an estimated value of €7 million for the division, consideration for the contribution consisted of 33,624 preferred shares each with a par value of €1, bringing Leemo’s share capital to 84,059 shares. The resulting contribution premium was €6,966,376. The contribution consisted mainly of intangible assets, which were measured by mutual agreement at €7 million. Conversion of preferred shares Besides carrying the same rights as ordinary shares, preferred shares may also be automatically converted into ordinary shares in 2021 in a proportion based on the “outperformance” achieved, as assessed according to changes in the respective contributions of the Primonial and Foncia groups to Leemo’s net revenue. An analysis of each group’s contribution could allow either (i) Primonial to increase its interest in Leemo to a maximum of 48,457 shares (49% of the share capital), or (ii) Foncia to collect up to €2 million in cash compensation. Accounting treatment applied Based on the majority shareholding in Leemo and the governance arrangements in place, the Group decided that it retained sole control of Leemo and that it would therefore continue to fully consolidate the company. The basis on which preferred shares may be converted also led the Group to consider that the financial asset adopted as consideration for the contribution (ordinary shares after conversion) did not represent a fixed basis for the exchange at 31 December 2018. Accordingly, it cannot demonstrate that a fixed number of ordinary shares will be offered as consideration for the aforementioned preferred shares. From the perspective of applicable accounting standards and IAS 32 in particular, this consideration prevents the preferred shares from being recognised as equity instruments. The preferred shares are therefore classified as financial liabilities by default. At 31 December 2018, considering that the “neutral” scenario was most likely, the liability was measured at 40% of Leemo’s enterprise value, i.e., €7 million, and was classified within non-current borrowings. ----- ###### Implementation of a free share plan by Foncia Stark Characteristics of the plan: - Grant date: 23 May 2018  - Date on which the continuing employment condition is assessed: 23 May 2020  - Vesting period for the shares: between 23 May 2018 and 23 May 2020 - Maximum number of shares awarded: up to 205,000 free shares in the company, representing 5.125% of its share capital - Maximum aggregate amount of the free share plan: €410,000 - The shares awarded are monetised through a new liquidity contract which prices the share using a calculation formula. - Corporate social contribution (forfait social): 20% of the free share plan The value of the free shares awarded represents discretionary compensation granted to employees. Since a liquidity contract has been set up, the shares awarded to beneficiaries will be settled in cash. The free share plan therefore meets the definition of a “cash-settled” plan set out in IFRS 2. Consequently, the service cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period against a related liability. At 31 December 2018, the service cost amounted to €149,000 and was recognized within capitalised production with an adjusting entry to employee-related payables. It will be amortised as from the date the “Millenium” project (development of new management software for the property management network) enters into service. The service cost will be reviewed each year in light of budget assumptions and turnover. Debt restructuring On 18 July and 3 August 2018, the Group restructured its borrowings with its lenders in order to secure better interest terms. (i) Modification of the ICA tranche on 18 July 2018 - Reduction of 50 bps in the applicable margin: the “cash margin” is reduced from 7.5% to 7%, while the “PIK margin” is reduced from 8.5% to 8%.  - Elimination of the 3-month Euribor 1% floor: in the current negative interest rate environment, the E3M benchmark rate is therefore reduced to 0%.  - Elimination of applicable 2% penalties in the event of early repayment as from 18 July 2019. (ii) Partial repayment of the ICA loan on 3 August 2018 Repayment of €77 million of this loan. The related fees for early repayment amount to €1.5 million. (iii) Subscription of a new €80 million tranche (“B4”) of the senior facility The financing terms applicable to this B4 tranche are identical to those applicable to the B3 tranche renegotiated in March 2017 (see Note 4.11.3). The issuance fees for the new tranche amount to €1.25 million and will be recognised over the term of the facility by an adjustment to financial expenses at the effective interest rate as calculated at 3 August 2018 (3.68%). IFRS 9 accounting treatment From an accounting perspective, this restructuring is part of an overall initiative to optimise the Group’s borrowing costs. The modifications were therefore analysed as a whole to determine whether they are substantial and therefore ascertain the appropriate accounting treatment to be used. ----- ###### Based on this analysis, using both quantitative and qualitative tests, there were substantial modifications to the initial terms of the ICA loan. As a result, the initial accounting treatment was discontinued, with all related unamortised expenses charged to profit or loss in an amount of €4 million. The fees due on early repayment were immediately expensed in an amount of €1.5 million. Economic and Social Unit (UES) On 21 August 2018, in response to strong employee demand for a single and harmonized framework within which to exercise their duties, the Versailles Tribunal d’Instance recognised the existence of an Economic and Social Unit (Unité Économique et Sociale – UES) between the various legal entities belonging to the network comprising the Property Management France/Transactions businesses, plus Foncia Carrières et Compétences (124 companies at 21 August 2018). This decision signals the start of a new, inclusive modus operandi as the basis for implementing the Group’s growth strategy and securing the commitment of all employees within its network. ----- ###### NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS General principles used to prepare the financial statements The accounting policies described in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the standards adopted as described in Note 3.2.2, effective as of 1 January 2018, including those relating to the first-time application of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for assets held for sale and related liabilities, measured in accordance with IFRS 5, and certain financial instruments carried at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9. The consolidated financial statements of Foncia Management at 31 December 2018 were adopted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting of 11 April 2019, and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the General Meeting on 29 June 2019. They are presented in thousands of euros and amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest thousand unless otherwise specified. Consequently, the sum of these amounts may differ slightly from the total amounts reported. Accounting standards 3.2.1. Basis of preparation of financial information Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 297/2008 of 11 March 2008, the 2018 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and applicable at 1 January 2018. The full text of the standards adopted by the European Union can be consulted on the European Commission’s website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting_en At the end of the reporting period, there was no difference between the IFRS used to prepare these financial statements and the standards adopted by the IASB and applicable for the period presented. The accounting policies and bases of measurement applied to prepare these consolidated financial statements are described in Note 3.4 below. 3.2.2. Changes in accounting standards Main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations in force within the European Union and mandatorily applicable as of 1 January 2018 The accounting policies and bases of measurement used by the Group to prepare its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 are identical to those used by the Group at 31 December 2017, with the exception of: - IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers ###### On 28 May 2014, the IASB published IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which impacts the timing of revenue recognition by the Group. IFRS 15 sets out a single model framework to account for revenue arising on contracts with customers. According to the fundamental principle of the new standard, revenue is recognised based on when the goods and services promised in the contract are provided to the customer, and for the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange. ----- ###### IFRS 15 sets out a five-step model framework for recognising and measuring revenue. The new standard, which replaces IAS 18, was not early adopted by the Group. It was applied retrospectively at 1 January 2018 using the simplified retrospective transition method, i.e., the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 15 is recognised at 1 January 2018 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity. Accordingly, equity at 31 December 2017 has been restated for the impacts of IFRS 15. A summary of the impacts of IFRS 15 on each line of the statement of financial position is provided below.

Summary of the estimated impacts of applying IFRS 15 on pro forma profit (loss) for 2017 (12 months) In accordance with the simplified retrospective method, IFRS 15 is applicable only to contracts in force at the date of first-time application. This results in two non-comparable revenue figures: revenue as determined under IFRS 15 and revenue as determined under IAS 18. Accordingly, the Group has decided to also present the impacts that IFRS 15 would have had on profit (loss) for the 2017 reporting period, as compared with IAS 18.

Sales recorded at the end of the 2017 reporting period were reversed at the start of the period and recognised in 2018 at the date on which the agreement was signed.

From an accounting standpoint, the Group considers that wages and other fixed costs would have remained the same irrespective of the restated revenue, in the same way as transaction bonuses and premiums calculated on the basis of signed notarial deeds only. • Assurimo: Revenue is recorded over the term of the contract, since services in this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis. Up to 2017, revenue was chiefly recognised when customers were invoiced for insurance premiums (mostly at the end of the year). Revenue restated for IFRS 15 was calculated based on recognition on a straight-line basis applying a stable seasonality factor equal to 8% of total revenue. - IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments ###### On 24 July 2014, the IASB published a new standard on financial instruments replacing most of the existing provisions under IFRS, and particularly IAS 39. The Group did not early adopt IFRS 9. The requirements of the standard in terms of the classification, measurement and impairment of financial instruments are applied by the Group retrospectively, with no adjustments to information for comparative periods. • Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and liabilities based on the entity’s business model and the applicable contractual terms. Under IFRS 9, all equity instruments should be measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, with gains and losses either taken to profit or loss or recognised through other comprehensive income in accordance with an option taken by the entity that cannot subsequently be revoked. In this case, only dividends will tend to be recognised in profit or loss. The Group has reviewed and measured its financial assets at 1 January 2018 in light of the facts and circumstances existing at that date, and considers that the first-time application of IFRS 9 would not have a material impact on the classification and measurement of the items concerned. The only impact is on the Group’s shareholdings in Swiss property companies and cooperatives, some of which were sold during the year. Classified as held to maturity under IAS 39 (and therefore carried at amortised cost), these shareholdings have been reclassified within equity instruments carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. In this respect, they were remeasured at 1 January in an amount of €685,000, with an adjusting entry posted to total equity. Concerning the measurement of financial liabilities, IFRS 9 introduces very few changes to the requirements that existed under IAS 39, and no impacts were identified as a result of the new standard in the 2018 financial statements. The Group had analysed its debt repricing operations in 2017 in light of the principles of IAS 39 but also taking into account the changes introduced by IFRS 9. Accordingly, the first-time application of IFRS 9 did not have any retrospective impact in the 2018 financial statements in this respect. • Phase 2: Impairment As a basis for financial asset impairment, IFRS 9 requires use of an expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model under IAS 39. The expected loss model requires entities to recognise expected losses on its receivables, with any changes in these losses to be recognised at the end of each reporting period in order to reflect changes in the credit risk since initial recognition. ----- ###### Since impairment is not material in the Group’s B-to-C business, no changes were made to the accounting policies used to recognise impairment provisions. The Group is exposed to limited bad debt risk on its commercial receivables as the risk is concentrated mainly in Foncia IPM’s operations, which accounts for less than 4% of consolidated revenue. • Phase 3: Hedge accounting The new requirements for general hedge accounting maintain the three hedging categories identified under IAS 39. IFRS 9 offers greater flexibility as regards transactions that may be eligible for hedge accounting, particularly in terms of instruments that may be designated as hedging instruments and the type of risks that may be hedged in a non-financial hedge. The hedge effectiveness test has also been revised and replaced by the notion of an “economic relationship” between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is no longer required. Broader disclosure requirements for entities in terms of risk management have also been introduced. The Group does not use instruments meeting the definition of hedging instruments for accounting purposes. - IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration - Amendment to IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions - Amendment to IAS 40 – Transfers of Investment Property - Amendments to IFRS 4 – Applying IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” with IFRS 4 “Insurance Contracts” - Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2014-2016 cycle ###### The first-time application of these standards, amendments and interpretations does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Other new standards and guidance applicable after 1 January 2019 and not early adopted by the Group - IFRS 16 – Leases ###### IFRS 16, the new standard on leases, was published on 13 January 2016 and will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and any related IFRIC and SIC interpretations. The new standard no longer applies a distinction between operating and finance leases. Accordingly, the Group will be required to recognise in its statement of financial position all of its lease obligations within the meaning of IFRS 16 in the same manner as currently required under IAS 17 for finance leases. The rights and obligations resulting from a lease contract will therefore be recognised in assets and liabilities, respectively, rather than in off-balance sheet commitments as is currently the case for operating leases. The Group will apply IFRS 16 for the first time at 1 January 2019 using a simplified retrospective approach, with no restatement of comparative figures. The Group has a large number of leases across its entire French and international branch network. There are many different types of leases, from property leases to vehicle leases. The first-time application of IFRS 16 will therefore have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. To prepare for its first-time application of the standard, the Group has been functionally assisted by an external service provider in charge of leading and coordinating the project at the level of all affected divisions (finance, operations, property). The project has involved: - compiling data on leases for the France scope;  - reviewing the data compiled for the international scope;  - analysing data reliability based on a sample of different contract types; - validating the scope of application of the standard and its exclusions; ----- ###### - calculating the Group’s incremental borrowing rates;  - quantifying the impacts;  - identifying criteria and options affecting the measurement of lease assets. All leases concerned by the standard have now been identified and their data analysed. In 2019, around 705 property leases in France will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16, including 281 contracts which are automatically renewable. This figure does not include any new leases that may begin in 2019, including those resulting from acquisitions. The exemptions provided for by the standard as regards short-term leases (with a term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets will not be applied. The Group is currently reviewing quantified estimates of the IFRS 16 impact. - IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts - IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments - Amendment to IFRS 9 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation - Amendment to IAS 28 – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures - Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2015-2017 cycle - Amendment to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement - Amendment to IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material ###### These standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted or are in the process of being adopted by the European Union. Subject to their adoption, they are applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group is currently analysing the potential impacts of applying the requirements set out in these texts for the first time. Use of management estimates in applying the Group’s accounting standards The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the measurement and presentation of certain assets and liabilities and any disclosures provided in respect of contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given the circumstances. These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Where applicable, a sensitivity analysis may be performed if the estimates are material. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates made by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. ▪ Measurements used in testing goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. ----- ###### As with any estimate, the assumptions used in these calculations are partly based on uncertain factors and may therefore need to be adjusted in subsequent periods. Note 4.1.3 sets out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same note. ▪ Measurement of provisions The Group used the best estimate of its commitments and obligations to calculate the corresponding provisions. ▪ Measurement of employee benefits The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. Note 4.12 sets out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. ▪ Measurement of fair value (Level 1) The Group uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure unlisted derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents (see Notes 3.4.18 and 4.18). ▪ Measurement of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax expense The Group’s tax position (see Notes 4.8 and 5.11) is based on its best estimate of future taxable earnings. ▪ Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount. ▪ Assessment of criteria for identifying discontinued operations In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, the Group is required to exercise judgement in determining whether an asset or group of assets meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. IFRS 5 criteria are also used to identify any assets to be classified as discontinued operations. These assessments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in light of changes in the relevant facts and circumstances. In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, the Group uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements: ▪ present a true and fair view of the Foncia Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows; ▪ reflect the economic substance of transactions; ▪ are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects. Detailed disclosures in this regard are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. ----- ###### Basis of measurement 3.4.1. Basis of consolidation The financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using the same accounting policies and over the same period as those of the parent company. Controlled entities Companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or is entitled, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity in question and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Control is analysed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the inputs used to assess control has changed. A subsidiary is consolidated as from the date control is acquired, which is usually upon signature of the share transfer and disposal agreements (see “Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period” below). Consolidation ceases when control is relinquished. Any interest in the subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recognised within non-controlling interests. Profits and losses and each component of other comprehensive income relating to subsidiaries are allocated to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Changes in the percentage interest held in subsidiaries that do not lead to a change in control are treated as equity transactions, since the transactions take place between owners acting in their capacity as owners. The impact of these transactions is shown in equity net of tax and does not therefore impact consolidated profit or loss. These transactions are also shown in the statement of cash flows under cash flows relating to investing activities. Investments in equity-accounted companies (associates and joint ventures) Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s interest in the profits, losses and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments is applied to determine whether investments in associates or joint ventures need to be tested for impairment. Where necessary, the total carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets. Accounting for acquisitions ongoing at the end of the reporting period Non-consolidated investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and mainly consist of shares in property management companies that will subsequently be consolidated. ----- ###### Before acquiring shares in a property management company, the Group agrees to acquire the shares and pays 10% of the estimated price to the seller. This part payment is included in “Downpayments on acquisitions of securities” within non-current financial assets. The remaining 90% is booked in “Off-balance sheet commitments” (see Note 9). Upon signing the share transfer or disposal agreement, the Group pays an additional 70% of the estimated price to the seller. The estimated purchase price is included in equity investments, and the part payment already recognised is also reclassified to this caption. The acquired company is then consolidated. Following a review of the acquired company’s financial statements, the Group pays the remaining balance and adjusts the purchase price of the shares. Non-consolidated investments Companies with the following characteristics are not included in the scope of consolidation: ▪ they are in the process of being wound up or are dormant; ▪ their business is not strategic for the Group. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-consolidated investments are carried at fair value. There are no material obligations or liabilities relating to these entities. 3.4.2. Elimination of intragroup transactions All intragroup transactions and balances as well as any income, expenses, gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions and included in the carrying amount of assets are eliminated on consolidation. When a Group entity carries out a transaction with a joint venture or associate, the related gains and losses are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the interests held by third parties in the joint venture or associate. 3.4.3. Foreign currency translation Presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Functional currency and translation of the financial statements of foreign companies A consolidated entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the local currency. However, certain entities must adopt a functional currency other than their local currency when that currency represents the currency of the major transactions carried out by the entity and accurately reflects its economic environment. The financial statements of foreign entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are translated using the “closing rate” method. Under this method, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period, while profit and loss and cash flow items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting currency translation differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income within equity under “Translation adjustments”. Goodwill relating to foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro are treated as assets acquired or liabilities assumed and therefore translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. ----- ###### Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedged rate. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the closing exchange rate, with the resulting gains and losses included in foreign exchange gains and losses under other financial income and expenses in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined. 3.4.4. Business combinations and goodwill In accordance with the revised IFRS 3, business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. According to this method, assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed that meet the recognition criteria under the revised IFRS 3 are measured at fair value. Goodwill is measured as the difference between the consideration transferred (purchase price plus the fair value of any previously-held interest and the value of any non-controlling interests) and the estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. It is recorded under “Goodwill” in the statement of financial position. Goodwill is calculated on a provisional basis at the time of the acquisition and is adjusted within 12 months of the acquisition date. When the business combination is a bargain purchase, negative goodwill is identified. The corresponding gain is included in profit or loss in the period of the acquisition. For each business combination, the Group may choose to account for non-controlling interests: - either at acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of goodwill on the non-controlling interests ###### (“full goodwill” method); - or based on the share of net identifiable assets of the acquired entity measured at fair value, in which case ###### goodwill is only recognised on the portion attributable to owners of the parent (“partial goodwill” method). If the business combination is carried out in stages, the acquisition-date carrying amount of the previously-held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date.  Any resulting gains or losses are taken to profit or loss. In the event of deferred settlements, the future amounts payable are discounted to present value at the settlement date. The discount rate used is the same as that used to estimate the value of the assets. Any adjustments to the potential price are estimated at acquisition-date fair value. The initial measurement may only subsequently be adjusted against goodwill if new information is obtained arising from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date and to the extent that the measurement is still provisional (maximum measurement period of 12 months). Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price not meeting these criteria are included in liabilities or receivables, with an offsetting entry to profit or loss. During the 12-month measurement period, changes to the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed relating to recognised acquisitions are treated as retrospective adjustments to goodwill. After the end of the measurement period, changes to the estimated value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognised in profit or loss, with no adjustment to goodwill. ----- ###### In accordance with the revised IFRS 3, costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The value of goodwill is reviewed each year and may also be impaired (see Note 3.4.7). Earn-out payment The revised IFRS 3 gives certain indications as regards the accounting for contingent payment arrangements with employees or selling shareholders. These arrangements may be part of the business combination or may be considered as separate from the acquisition agreement for the target entity. In certain acquisitions, earn-out payments were considered part of the consideration for post-acquisition services rendered and are therefore expensed in the periods concerned and in future periods. 3.4.5. Intangible assets Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets with no physical substance. In accordance with IAS 38, intangible assets that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost when the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are carried at fair value separately from goodwill. Intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite useful life (software and licences) are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives: - Client relationships: 18-21 years - Software programs: 1-10 years - Other intangible assets: 5 years ###### Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised. They are included with other assets within cash-generating units (CGUs) and tested for impairment using the discounted cash flow method at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. When the recoverable amount of these assets calculated based on criteria prevailing at the acquisition date falls below their carrying amount, an impairment provision is recorded. Trademarks Identifiable trademarks are measured using a multi-criteria approach which takes into consideration both their reputation and profitability. The Group classified its main “Foncia” trademark along with the “Trévi” trademark in Belgium and the “Domicim” and “Brolliet” trademarks in Switzerland as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Business software programs Software acquired is carried at cost (purchase price plus ancillary expenses). When allocating the purchase price, certain software programs may also be measured using the replacement cost approach. Business goodwill and client relationships Client relationships include the list of mandates held by the Group’s companies. A mandate is an instrument by which a person (the principal) gives another person (the agent) the power of proxy. France’s Hoguet Law requires ----- ###### professional property agents to hold a written mandate in order to put properties up for sale or let, and to manage property. Client relationships are measured based on the excess earnings method. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly comprise the cost of acquiring new business. 3.4.6. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including customs duties and non-recoverable taxes, and any costs directly incurred to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted from the purchase price. Subsequent expenditure is recognised in expenses, unless it improves the asset’s initial performance, prolongs its useful life, or reduces the operating costs previously determined. Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives. In accordance with IAS 16, property, plant and equipment are recognised using the component approach, with each component depreciated separately over its useful life: - Buildings: 20-50 years - Fixtures and fittings: 8-10 years - IT equipment: 4 years - Vehicle fleet: 5 years - Furniture: 10 years - Office equipment: 4 years ###### Useful lives are reviewed each year and may be adjusted if expectations differ from previous estimates. Gains and losses on asset disposals are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset concerned. 3.4.7. Impairment losses on goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment The carrying amounts of non-current non-financial assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in order to identify any potential impairment: - goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually and ###### whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired; - all other assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. ###### External indicators of impairment include changes in the general economic and financial environment, downtrends in local economic environments and changes in economic performance. These are analysed by the Group to determine whether the assets concerned should be tested for impairment more frequently. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs ) or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies arising on the business combination.  The Group decides whether or not to recognise an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities in a CGU or group of CGUs with their recoverable amount. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets for internal management purposes. ----- ###### The Group has identified the following three CGUs corresponding to its major development and investment strategies: - Property management companies – France - Property management companies – International - Other activities (service companies and other entities) ###### The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value (generally market price) less costs to sell and its value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is calculated based on available information used to establish the best estimate of the selling price net of costs to sell in an arm’s length transaction between fully informed, willing parties. Value in use as calculated by the Group generally corresponds to the present value of the future cash flows attributable to a CGU or group of CGUs, taking into account their residual value and based on the most probable assumptions adopted by management. The assumptions used are based on the budgets and business plans prepared by management for each business. These budgets are the latest budgets approved by the Supervisory Board at the date of preparation of the financial statements. Other assumptions affecting the calculation of the recoverable amount include the growth rate, operating margin, the discount rate and the tax rate (see Note 4.1). The discount rate used to discount post-tax cash flows to their present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Where there is no specific discount rate for the assets tested, the average cost of capital is used. The discount rates are post-tax rates and are applied to post-tax cash flows. The recoverable amount calculated using post-tax discount rates is equal to that which would have been obtained using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36. If the carrying amount of the CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the related assets are written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and then to the carrying amount of the other assets of the CGU, in proportion to their carrying amount. This must not result in the carrying amount of an individual asset falling below the higher of its fair value, value in use and zero. Impairment losses are recognised in other operating expenses and may not be reversed. 3.4.8. Financial assets The measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities is defined by the new IFRS 9 – Financial instruments. Unlike IAS 39, IFRS 9 applies a single analytical framework to all financial assets in order to determine the classification and basis of measurement to be used for accounting purposes. The four IAS 39 categories have been replaced by three categories, each associated with a specific measurement approach. More specifically: ✓ Debt instruments held in a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, are generally carried at amortised cost. ✓ Debt instruments held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows (whose contractual conditions give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest [SPPI] on the principal amount outstanding) and selling financial assets, are typically carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. ✓ All other debt and equity instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. ----- ###### A summary of these new financial asset classification and measurement requirements is set out below:",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Calculation of the recoverable amount of the CGUs at 30 November 2018 In accordance with the Group’s impairment testing approach (see Note 3.4.7), and in the absence of observable fair values in an organised market, the recoverable amount of CGUs corresponds to their value in use, which is defined as the sum of their net cash flows based on the latest forecasts for each CGU, determined using: ▪ a business plan prepared by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performance, forecast changes in the economic environment, and expected market trends; ▪ a terminal value calculated by capitalising normative cash flows obtained by extrapolating cash flows from the final year of the business plan, with a stable growth rate or a growth rate increasing steadily over the long term; ▪ expected cash flows discounted at a rate determined by reference to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The forecasts used in the impairment tests carried out at 30 November 2018 are taken from the consolidated “Low Case” business plans prepared by management in March 2018 covering a specified period of three years. These business plans were validated by the Board in March 2018 and presented to the Statutory Auditors in June of that year. The forecasts used were extrapolated through to 2022, to ensure that revenue, depreciation and amortisation approached normative levels. It should be noted that all holding company expenses not allocated in the consolidated business plan were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU. Corporate functions are managed at individual country-level for the Property Management International CGU and are considered not material for the Services CGU. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated based on a sample of six comparable European companies. A WACC was estimated for each foreign country based on their tax rates and the yield on their sovereign bonds. A WACC was then calculated for the entire Foncia Group based on a weighting of each country’s contribution to total EBITDA. On this basis, a single weighted discount rate of 7.4% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The value of the assets to be tested for impairment at 31 December 2018 is €27 million higher than the value tested at 30 November 2018. In light of this, the results of the earlier impairment test are still relevant and no impairment needs to be booked at 31 December 2018. Sensitivity analyses and break-even points As recommended by IFRS, the results of these impairment tests were verified by determining sensitivity to changes in certain inputs: ▪ +/- 1% change in the long-term growth rate used in the business plan; ▪ +/- 1% change in the discount rate (WACC); ▪ normative EBITDA growth rate.

The Group also estimated the value of the Brolliet trademark at CHF 13.7 million (i.e., €12.5 million at 31 December 2020), as well as the Lodgis and Gribi trademarks, at €2.3 million and €2.8 million, respectively. Concessions, patents and software Concessions, patents and software include the systems measured in connection with the purchase price accounting for Foncia Group at €5.2 million, as well as the management software used by Lodgis representing €1.3 million. It should be noted that the amortization plan for the remeasurement adjustment recognised in respect of the Thetrawin software (internally developed) was prospectively revised at 1 January 2020 in line with the Foncia Group’s migration to “Millénium”, slated for completion at the end of 2021. Investments in the period totalled €7.6 million and mainly concern Seiitra (€5.3 million) for upgraded Thetrawin modules (Powimo project) and regulatory modules (Thetrawin Legacy), along with Switzerland (€1.3 million), primarily IT capital expenditure at DBS Immobilier for €1.1 million. Other contributors to this item represent investments totalling €0.7 million and relate primarily to Germany. Other changes amounting to €6 million chiefly concern the capitalization of assets in progress by Foncia Groupe (ongoing IT projects), Foncia Management (Workday) and the German branch. Client relationships Client relationships include the fair value of the mandates held by Group companies, as estimated at the time of the September 2016 purchase price accounting for €460.8 million (carrying amount of €356.7 million at 31 December 2020), as well as client relationships relating to management and architectural activities at Brolliet, valued at €6.9 million in September 2016 (carrying amount of €5.4 million at 31 December 2020). Client relationships also include portfolios acquired since September 2016 as part of the Group’s acquisition-led growth strategy (jointly owned properties and managed rental properties). Other changes reflect the measurement of Sigla, Axium and Gribi client relationships for a total of €26.4 million. Investments in the period totalled €0.9 million and primarily relate to acquisitions of portfolios, in particular Immobiliers Setois, Mazelie and Ethic Gestion. Lastly, the Primonial client relationship recorded by Leemo was written down in an amount of €7 million, as the business has been loss-making since 2018 and its medium-term profitability outlook is particularly downbeat. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets essentially comprise the cost of acquiring new business. The €4.5 million increase in this item during the period reflects the capitalisation of the costs of acquiring new mandates, rebilled to other firms in the network. Decreases totalling €0.8 million relate to the retirement of these costs for lots that were not secured in the period. Intangible assets in progress Intangible assets in progress include various Group projects that can be capitalised. At 31 December 2020, the main contributors to this item are Foncia Groupe for €24.6 million in relation to IT projects, Foncia Stark for €33.3 million in relation to the development and roll-out of the Millenium software, and Seiitra for €4 million in relation to the Powimo project. Investments in the period primarily concern Foncia Groupe for €6.1 million and Foncia Stark for €16.2 million. ----- ###### Property, plant and equipment Change in Property, plant and equipment** Monetary Decreases/ Depreciation/ Translation Other",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

These contracts are managed using a dynamic approach directly in line with the operating performance of the Group’s branch network and its real estate strategy. In France, around 789 property leases were included in this caption at 31 December 2020 (808 property leases at 31 December 2019), of which around 40% are automatically renewable. The main leases (in terms of rent) relate to the head office at Antony, Foncia Paris Rive Droite at 27 rue de Provence in Paris, Esset Management in Aubervilliers, and Foncia Paris Rive Gauche at rue Raymond Losserand and Boulevard de Courcelles in Paris. Changes in the period can be explained as follows: ➢ New leases signed in France for €28.2 million concern a total of 69 new contracts. However, the five main leases account for almost 67% of the increase in right-of-use assets. These include the new premises at 27 rue de Provence in Paris, representing €12.6 million in right-of-use assets. ➢ Changes in the scope of consolidation concern 94 property leases taken on from the various companies acquired in the period, notably Gérance de Passy (€2.2 million), Yxime (€1.5 million) and Prazisa in Germany (€1.1 million). It should be noted that within the scope of its systems development to support the roll-out of the “Millénium” project, in May 2020 the Group signed a framework agreement with BNP Paribas for the lease of Apple equipment (supplies in bundles comprising hardware, software and services, namely AppleCare for iphones, ipads and Macbooks). As the project began to be rolled out in July 2020, this led to an increase of €3.5 million in right-of-use assets at 31 December 2020. The project will be gradually rolled out over the next few years, with the roll-out slated for completion by the end of 2025. |Remeasurements, Change in Right-of-use assets 31 Dec. 2019 Disposals/ Depreciation/ Translation Other New leases modifications and scope of (€ thousands) (restated) retirements impairment adjustments changes terminations consolidation Property leases 158,950 33,213 ( 90) 2,040 14,774 150 ( 5,593) Leasehold rights 8,688 102 ( 1,288) 3,488 Vehicles 9,658 1,186 ( 6) 561 36 ( 1,405) Photocopiers 4,589 3,776 ( 369) 173 5 ( 2,981) IT equipment 3,526 Other property, plant and equipment 455 3 ( 127) Gross value 182,340 41,803 ( 1,378) 1,665 18,996 194 ( 10,107) Property leases ( 30,570) 90 ( 40,769) 773 ( 583) ( 20) 6,014 Leasehold rights ( 115) Vehicles ( 4,127) ( 3,499) 42 ( 23) 1,580 Photocopiers ( 2,722) ( 2,611) 118 ( 2) 3,033 IT equipment ( 800) Other property, plant and equipment ( 63) ( 110) ( 1) 64|31 Dec. 2020| |---|---| ||203,443 10,990 10,030 5,190 3,526 331| ||233,510| ||( 65,064) ( 115) ( 6,026) ( 2,183) ( 800) ( 111)| |Accumulated depreciation/impairment ( 37,596) 90 ( 47,789) 933 ( 583) ( 46) 10,691|( 74,298)| |Right-of-use assets, net 144,744 41,803 ( 1,288) ( 47,789) 2,598 18,413 147 584 Of which property leases 128,380 33,213 ( 40,769) 2,813 14,191 130 421 France 116,380 28,243 ( 33,669) ( 787) 6,594 791 Switzerland 9,569 1,893 ( 3,379) 2,103 130 ( 290) Germany 1,283 2,925 ( 3,325) 1,350 7,565 ( 81) Belgium 1,148 153 ( 397) 147 33 ( 0) Of which leasehold rights 8,573 102 ( 1,288) 3,488 Of which vehicles 5,531 1,186 ( 3,499) 37 561 13 175 France 4,731 799 ( 2,545) ( 9) 347 ( 160) Switzerland 730 48 ( 652) 53 13 223 Germany 70 340 ( 302) ( 7) 214 112 Of which photocopiers 1,867 3,776 ( 2,611) ( 251) 173 3 52 Of which IT equipment 3,526 ( 800) Of which other property, plant and equipment 393 ( 110) 1 ( 64) Right-of-use assets, net 144,744 41,803 ( 1,288) ( 47,789) 2,598 18,413 147 584|159,212 138,379 117,553 10,027 9,715 1,084 10,875 4,004 3,162 415 427 3,007 2,726 220 159,212| ----- ###### 4.4.2.

Assumptions used The value of IFRS 16 right-of-use assets and lease liabilities is largely dependent on the assumptions used to determine the lease term and, to a lesser extent, the discount rate. ➢ Lease terms generally correspond to the non-cancellable (i.e., contractual) periods of the lease. This is notably the case for leases of vehicles, photocopiers and IT equipment, for which no renewal option is generally taken into account. The enforceable period of these leases generally matches their contractual term. |Remeasurements, Change in Other Lease liabilities 31 Dec. 2019 Translation New leases Repayments modifications and scope of non-monetary (€ thousands) (restated) adjustments terminations consolidation changes Property leases 100,196 31,908 ( 90) 85 1,653 9,747 ( 39,783) Vehicles 3,767 1,186 ( 43) 17 35 266 ( 4,281) Photocopiers 1,441 3,776 1 ( 262) 116 ( 3,800) IT equipment 3,526 ( 172) ( 2,410) Other property, plant and equipment 236 0 ( 121) Non-current lease liabilities 105,641 40,395 ( 305) 103 1,426 10,129 ( 50,395) Property leases 33,226 1,124 ( 36,376) 45 1,124 4,370 39,987 Vehicles 1,976 ( 3,023) ( 3) 286 4,482 Photocopiers 247 ( 2,633) 2 56 4,039 IT equipment ( 772) 2,410 Other property, plant and equipment 158 ( 104) 1 58 Current lease liabilities 35,607 1,124 ( 42,908) 46 1,124 4,711 50,976|31 Dec. 2020| |---|---| ||103,716 947 1,270 944 115| ||106,992 43,501 3,718 1,711 1,638 113| ||50,681| |Total lease liabilities 141,248 41,519 ( 43,213) 149 2,550 14,840 581 Of which property leases 133,422 33,032 ( 36,466) 130 2,777 14,117 204 France 121,242 28,061 ( 29,774) ( 803) 6,519 576 Switzerland 9,704 1,893 ( 3,178) 130 2,083 ( 291) Germany 1,299 2,925 ( 3,129) 1,350 7,565 ( 82) Belgium 1,177 153 ( 384) 147 33 ( 0) Of which vehicles 5,744 1,186 ( 3,066) 14 35 552 201 France 4,916 799 ( 2,092) ( 9) 338 ( 99) Switzerland 768 48 ( 649) 14 52 171 Germany 60 340 ( 325) ( 8) 214 129 Of which photocopiers 1,689 3,776 ( 2,633) 3 ( 262) 171 240 Of which IT equipment 3,526 ( 944) Of which other property, plant and equipment 393 ( 104) 1 ( 63) Total lease liabilities 141,248 41,519 ( 43,213) 149 2,550 14,840 581|| ||157,673 147,217 125,823 10,341 9,928 1,125 4,666 3,852 404 410 2,981 2,582 228 157,673| |Contractual schedule of payments under lease liabilities (€ thousands)|At 31 Dec. 2020|Between 2022 and 2 021 Beyond 2025 2025| |---|---|---| |Property leases Vehicles Photocopiers and IT equipment Other property, plant and equipment|158 690 4 766 6 063 235|47 427 88 287 22 976 3 780 986 3 485 2 578 113 122| |Total future minimum lease payments|169 754|54 805 91 973 22 976| |Impact of discounting|( 12 081)|( 4 124) ( 6 952) ( 1 005)| |Total lease liabilities|157 673|50 681 85 021 21 971| ----- #####  ###### For French property leases, the Group may consider any early termination options (i.e., at the end of the first or second three-year period), or an enforceable period that goes beyond the contractual period. This analysis is based on the prevailing operating and strategic environment at the reporting date and is reviewed each year by the Group’s Property division.  In the particular case of automatically renewable property leases in France, the Group now analyses the broader economics of a lease in determining its enforceable period pursuant to the IFRS IC’s agenda decision. A single reasonably certain term of three years is used to measure these leases. This estimate takes into account (i) the need for the business to continue operating which acts as an incentive to continue the initial lease, but also (ii) the Group’s strongly proactive and opportunistic real estate strategy in streamlining its property portfolio (notably during restructuring operations resulting from its acquisitions). ➢ Under IFRS 16, the discount rate for each lease is to be determined by reference to the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. In practice, given how the Group is organised financially, i.e., held or guaranteed almost exclusively by the three French holding companies, the Group adopted an incremental borrowing rate of 3.25% for all of its lease contracts (excluding vehicle leases), reflecting the Group’s own borrowing rate. This rate corresponds to the sum of the risk-free rate and the Group’s credit spread over the initial term of the syndicated loan (i.e., without considering the term). The value of the vehicle fleet in France is estimated based on the interest rate implicit in the leases, as supplied by Arval, i.e., 2.56%. With regard to the other main assumptions and practical expedients: #####  ###### The practical expedient exempting low-value or short-term leases has not been adopted by the Group.  Leases previously classified as finance leases under IAS 17 were classified as finance leases at 1 January 2019. To simplify, the residual useful life of these leases is calculated in the same way as under IAS 17.  Restoration costs: - Property leases: restoration costs are only calculated for major new leases, since it is difficult to reliably estimate such costs for all of the Group’s leases, as they are frequently negotiated with the lessor at the end of the lease. - Vehicle fleet: In France, the Group adopted an average cost of €700 per vehicle (cost plus 20% for private vehicles on which VAT cannot be recovered) in measuring the right-of-use asset corresponding to the residual value guarantee. This average cost was calculated based on a market estimate and taking into account the historical cost actually incurred when changing the automotive fleet at the beginning of 2019.  Deferred tax is recognised on the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability falling within the scope of IFRS 16, in a similar way to that previously recognised for finance leases.  Services provided in relation to the lease are included in the calculation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on a case-by-case basis and by category of underlying asset. In particular, for the lease contract with BNP Paribas concerning Apple IT equipment, the Group has chosen not to separate the lease components from the service components, and therefore to consider all payments as relating to the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities must be calculated for both leases of equipment and for any services component. It should be noted that the Group was not concerned by any lease concessions in the period. ----- ###### Non-current financial assets Change in Change in fair Other **Of which",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

These deferred taxes were recognised against the taxable temporary difference relating to the Foncia trademark for €354.7 million. Tax loss carry-forwards Tax loss carry-forwards within the tax consolidation group at 31 December 2020 are as follows (after utilisation in the current period): • Loss arising on tax consolidation: €12.9 million. This tax loss has been recognised in full in view of the high probability that sufficient future taxable profit will exist against which it can be utilised. • Proprietary tax losses of consolidated companies (arising prior to joining the tax consolidation group): €29.2 million, of which €28.9 million not recognised due to the improbability that sufficient future taxable earnings will be available against which the losses could be utilised (of which Foncia Holding for €8.9 million, IDHA for €4.8 million, Syndic+ for €2.8 million and Bourgeois Immobilier for €2.7 million). At 31 December 2020, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of tax loss carry-forwards chiefly concern tax consolidation arrangements (€3.3 million), proprietary tax losses of companies in the tax consolidation group (€0.1 million), Efficity (€0.9 million) and Yxime (€1.1 million). Deferred tax on temporary differences Deferred taxes on temporary differences mainly arise on provisions for employee profit-sharing and paid leave, acquisition-related fees, and the tax treatment of translation adjustments. Deferred tax on other adjustments Changes in deferred taxes on other adjustments are mainly attributable to changes in the scope of consolidation (€8.1 million) and reflect the cancellation of existing business goodwill in the individual statement of financial position of companies consolidated for the first time during the period.

These two drawdowns totalling €90 million were also repaid in September 2020. • Three additional drawdowns, amounting to €60 million (21 September 2020), €60 million (21 October 2020) and €100 million (23 November 2020) were made and later repaid, on 21 October, 23 November and 23 December 2020, respectively. • In all at 31 December 2020, the Group had utilised a total of €120 million of the revolving credit facility, including €20 million drawn on 18 December 2020 and €100 million on 23 December 2020. These two drawdowns will be repaid in January 2021. It should also be noted that the full 2018 CICE prefinancing credit was refunded in 2020 in an amount of €8.2 million. Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €8 million chiefly result from borrowings and debt taken on from Gérance de Passy (€3.3 million) and Foncia IAG (€1.5 million). Debt relating to Bourgeois Immobilier was repaid in the period in an amount of €1.1 million. To mitigate the economic and financial consequences of the Covid-19 crisis, Efficity contracted a government-backed one-year cash loan for €1.4 million. This loan was repaid ahead of maturity in December 2020. Liabilities relating to put options on non-controlling interests As described in the “Highlights of the year” section, on 25 February 2020 the Group exercised its call option on the Trévi group, acquiring 8% of the shares it did not already own in the group for a total purchase consideration of €2.7 million. The full amount of the liability relating to the put option granted to non-controlling interests was therefore reversed. Shareholder loan Interest on the shareholder loan is capitalised at a rate of 11.7%. The Group repaid €16 million of its shareholder loan on 13 November 2020. Update on the financial liabilities recognised in respect of the preferred shares issued within the scope of the Leemo/Primonial transaction: As described in the “Highlights of the year” section, the €7 million financial liability was reset to zero against income amounting to €7 million recorded in non-recurring operating items (see Note 2.4). 4.11.2.

A provision is set aside for all outstanding obligations, estimated based on rights accrued and salary projections, taking into account mortality rates, employee turnover and a discount. For France, the increase in provisions for retirement benefits is mainly attributable to the service cost totalling €1.4 million, reflecting the increase in the net obligation resulting from the contributions of Foncia personnel in 2020. These actuarial gains are recognised in other comprehensive income within consolidated equity net of tax. The increase in obligations in respect of long-service awards can be chiefly explained by the service cost in 2020 (€0.7 million) and by the measurement of employee benefit obligations taken on as a result of the acquisitions of Yxime and Gérance de Passy (€0.2 million). The take-up rate for long-service awards was maintained at 100%. Obligations in respect of long-service awards are included within other long-term benefits in accordance with IAS 19. Any related actuarial gains and losses are taken to profit or loss in the period. In Switzerland, the increase in the net benefit obligation in the period is essentially due to the service cost of CHF 4.5 million (€4.2 million) as well as net actuarial losses amounting to CHF 0.4 million (€0.3 million).

Outside France, this caption chiefly concerns Switzerland (€1.8 million), where the miscellaneous long-standing risks are monitored by the local management team. ▪ Update on the dispute with franchisees By way of a reminder, in 2014 franchisees had brought proceedings against the Foncia Group after receiving notice that their contracts would not be renewed. They accused the Group of wrongful termination and various breaches of the franchise agreements. Of the 21 initial lawsuits, the Group either settled (most sensitive disputes), or won (before the lower court or on appeal) the cases. Only seven lawsuits are still in progress following the appeal to the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation). In January 2020, an initial decision was handed down in favour of Foncia Franchise by the court of appeal to which the case was referred after the Supreme Court appeal, in which that court dismissed all of the franchisee’s claims (including those that had been successful in the first instance). However, the franchisee has re-filed an appeal to the French Supreme Court. Hearings are pending before the referral court of appeal for the six other lawsuits (hearings scheduled for between January and April 2021 unless postponed due to Covid-19). Six decisions are pending from the court of appeal, and one from the French Supreme Court. ▪ Update on the Corum dispute After having terminated its distribution agreement with Primaliance, Corum, a property manager, brought proceedings against Primaliance for trademark infringement for continuing to list the real estate investment trust (SCPI) Corum Origin on its website, www.primaliance.com. The dispute is in progress before the courts. The Group maintained its €0.8 million provision in this respect and did not transfer it to Primaliance when the latter was sold to Bienprévoir.fr. Following some procedural issues in 2019 and 2020, the case is still ongoing and a date for the oral arguments is pending.

This provision was adjusted in the year and an amount of €0.3 million was written back and recorded within non-recurring items. Provisions for rent payment guarantees The technical increase in these provisions in the period chiefly results from the extension of the “winter truce” (tenant protection period during winter months applicable in France) to July 2020, which automatically increased the average age of past-due amounts owed by current tenants and made it impossible for the Group to bring proceedings against those tenants. New bad debts arising in the period remained broadly stable. It should be recalled that the amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). Provisions for employee disputes In France, the provision remained stable in 2020 at €3.6 million, and concerned 101 lawsuits at end-December 2020 compared to 98 lawsuits at 31 December 2019. Out of the 101 lawsuits, 100 are in progress and 25 relate to amounts in excess of €0.1 million. The increase in the period is mainly attributable to Germany, where provisions were recognised for a total of €1 million in respect of restructuring in progress (notably at Präzisa for €0.5 million and Foncia Deutschland for €0.3 million). |Aged analysis* of provisions for third party and 2016 and professional liability 2017 2018 2019 2020 earlier (€ thousands) Third party and professional liability insured with 1,856 366 560 569 692 Assurimo Third party and professional liability insured with other 558 28 93 2 437 insurance companies Total 2,414 394 653 571 1,129|Total at 31 December 2020| |---|---| ||4,043 1,118 5,161| ----- ###### Trade and other payables Change in Change in Trade and other payables** Translation Other",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

Revenue for the business was up €8.5 million (1.5%) in the period and reflects the following conflicting impacts: (i) the impact of acquisitions carried out in the year; (ii) the negative impact of the health crisis on the rental management business (essentially affecting amounts collected under commercial leases and incidental fees) as a direct result of the lockdown measures introduced in the second and fourth quarters of 2020), and on incidental fees earned on jointly owned properties (fees on transfer duties, reminders, renovation work and vacancies). Revenue for the Transactions business fell by €4.3 million, due mainly to the impact of the consecutive lockdowns introduced in view of the health crisis, with business volumes slowing sharply in April and May (first lockdown) and then again in November (branches closed) compared to the same period in 2019. Despite the impact of the health crisis, the Digital business posted significant revenue growth of €7.5 million on the back of a good performance from Efficity. |Revenue 2020 2019 (€ thousands)|Change| |---|---| |Property Management 579 833 571 263 % total revenue 60 % 61 % Of which rental management and lettings 283 579 283 649 Of which joint property management 290 441 281 122 Of which Foncia Croissance 1 912 2 439 Of which client accounts 3 901 4 053 Transactions (French network) 125 015 129 302 % total revenue 13 % 13 % Digital business 42 838 35 354 % total revenue 4 % 4 % Of which Efficity 37 125 27 803 Of which Lodgis 4 754 6 089 Of which Leemo 959 1 462 Other activities 87 812 98 991 % total revenue 9 % 10 % Of which B2B 34 471 28 018 Of which Assurimo 24 588 24 193 Of which Constatimmo 11 902 13 961 Of which Seiitra 12 945 12 097 Of which Foncia Pierre Gestion 11 067 Of which Investor division 6 504 Of which Foncia Valorisation 2 478 2 537 Of which Prowen 556 547 Of which Tech-way 746 Of which other 126 67|8 570 ( 70) 9 319 ( 527) ( 152) ( 4 287) 7 484 9 322 ( 1 335) ( 503) ( 11 179) 6 453 395 ( 2 059) 848 ( 11 067) ( 6 504) ( 59) 9 746 59| |Total – France 835 498 834 910|588| |% total revenue 87 % 88 %|| |Switzerland 67 293 67 222 Belgium 14 766 16 675 Germany 43 986 24 739|72 ( 1 909) 19 247| |Total – International 126 045 108 636|17 410| |% total revenue 13 % 11 %|| ||| |Total revenue 961 543 943 546|17 998| ----- ###### The €11.2 million decrease in revenue from the “Other activities” segment in France is mainly attributable to the impact of the disposals carried out in 2019 (Foncia Pierre Gestion and the Investor division) for €17.5 million.

These lease modifications only concern automatically renewable commercial leases in France, and increase interest expenses on lease liabilities in 2019 by an amount of €294,000. ###### Debt issuance costs represent €34.6 million at 31 December 2020, and are recognised over the term of the debt by adjusting the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability to the financial liability’s carrying amount. Additional drawdowns of senior facility tranches B5 in May 2019 (€178 million) and B6 in July 2019 (€110 million) explain the €5.7 million increase in interest on senior facility B. Similarly, the €4.5 million decrease in interest expenses on the ICA second-lien loan is attributable to the Group having made the final repayment on this facility in July 2019. The Group drew down more of its revolving credit facility in 2020 compared to 2019, which explains the higher interest expenses over the year. |Cost of net debt 2020 2019 (restated)(1) (€ thousands)|Change| |---|---| |Interest on syndicated loan ( 43 976) ( 41 274) Senior facility B ( 39 215) ( 33 523) Second-lien ICA ( 4 513) Revolving credit facility/Overdraft ( 3 055) ( 1 181) Commission on undrawn amounts of the revolving ( 1 706) ( 2 057) credit facility/Overdraft Deferred recognition of syndicated loan issuance costs ( 5 507) ( 4 993) Senior facility B ( 4 488) ( 4 054) Flamingo capex line ( 195) ( 199) Revolving credit facility/Overdraft ( 824) ( 740) Interest on shareholder loan ( 61 740) ( 55 251) Interest on other financial borrowings ( 5 375) ( 4 694) CICE prefinancing credit ( 30) ( 61) Interest expense on lease liabilities ( 4 959) ( 4 219) Other ( 385) ( 414) Change in fair value of interest rate hedges ( 39) ( 12)|( 2 702) ( 5 692) 4 513 ( 1 874) 351 ( 514) ( 434) 4 ( 84) ( 6 489) ( 681) 31 ( 740) 29 ( 27)| |Cost of gross debt ( 116 637) ( 106 224)|( 10 413)| ||| |Net income from cash and cash equivalents 1|1| |Cost of net debt ( 116 636) ( 106 224)|( 10 412)| ----- ###### The increase in interest on the shareholder loan results from the capitalisation of interest on the shareholder current account (bearing interest at 11.72%).

FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE Interest rate risk The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises mainly on its borrowings.

Cash flow surpluses and working capital requirements for the Group’s companies are centralised under a cash pooling agreement and managed by the Group’s Treasury department. The Group’s Treasury department selects investment vehicles for cash surpluses – either for proprietary cash or client cash (excluding separate accounts) – within the framework set by the management policy, which prioritises liquidity and security. Interest received is indexed to 3-month Euribor or is at fixed rates (term accounts).

NOTE 10. LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Update on the UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) dispute On 1 October 2014, UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) brought proceedings against Foncia Groupe before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance (regional court) seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by lessees of Foncia-managed properties who were unduly charged for receiving notices to pay (avis d’échéance). More specifically, UFC is seeking payment from Foncia Groupe of an amount of €2.30 per month and per lessee over a period of five years and estimates the number of lessees concerned at 318,400, bringing the total damages to €44 million. In its defence, the Group argues that the French law of 6 July 1989 on residential lease agreements, upon which basis UFC filed its claim, made no provision for class actions at the time of the alleged offence; that no law existed preventing lessees being charged for receiving notices to pay; and that this was therefore a lawful practice. Oral arguments were exchanged before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance in March 2018. The decision handed down in May 2018 dismissed UFC’s claims on the grounds that they fell outside the scope of a class action. UFC has appealed the decision and the hearings before the court of appeal have been postponed to 11 March 2021. The Group considers that no provision needs to be accrued in this respect in its financial statements at 31 December 2020. NOTE 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS None. NOTE 12.

The Group also estimated the value of the Brolliet trademark at CHF €13.7 million (i.e., €12.5 million at 31 December 2019). Changes in the scope of consolidation reflect the derecognition of the Foncia Pierre Gestion trademark, which had been valued at €6 million during the purchase price accounting for Foncia Management. Concessions, patents and software Concessions, patents and software include the systems measured in connection with the purchase price accounting for Foncia Management at €10.4 million, as well as the management software used by Lodgis representing €1.7 million. The Syndic+ software had been written down in full at end-June 2019 in an amount of €4.3 million (impairment recognised within non-recurring expenses). Investments in the period amounting to €2 million mainly concern the Swiss entities for €1.2 million (DBS Immobilier and Gribi). Other changes amounting to €32.7 million chiefly concern (i) the capitalisation of intangible assets in progress, including €17.6 million for the Seiitra network in respect of upgraded Thetrawin (Powimo project) and regulatory (Thetrawin Legacy) modules, and (ii) Foncia Groupe for €5.6 million in respect of miscellaneous ongoing IT projects. Business goodwill/client relationships At the time of Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting, the fair value of the Foncia Group’s client relationships was estimated at €460.8 million, breaking down between the Group’s three CGUs as follows: (i) Property Management France (excluding the transactions business): €396.2 million, (ii) Property Management International (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium): €2.2 million, and (iii) Services: €62.5 million. Following the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Brolliet group in September 2016, client relationships were valued at CHF 7.5 million (€6.9 million at 31 December 2019). Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €5.8 million reflect the derecognition of Foncia Pierre Gestion client relationships. Similarly, the Foncia Primaliance client relationship was reclassified within assets held for sale in an amount of €3 million. Investments totalling €1.3 million primarily relate to acquisitions of business goodwill within the scope of external growth transactions carried out in the period. |Amortisation/ Intangible assets Monetary Decreases/ impairment Change in Translation Assets First-time Other (€ thousands) 31 Dec. 2018 investments disposals scope of adjustments classified as application of changes Ordinary Exceptional consolidation held for sale IFRS 16|31 Dec. 2019| |---|---| |Trademarks 426,298 (6,000) 582 (3,100) 2,265 Concessions, patents and software 112,088 1,958 (1,589) 986 173 (481) 32,780 Leasehold rights 8,714 250 2 (8,964) Business goodwill/client relationships 481,793 1,322 (1) (7,001) 280 (3,501) 560 Other intangible assets 7,918 5,028 (1,669) 499 (1) (39) Intangible assets in progress 44,861 36,787 20 (37,096) Advances and downpayments on intangible assets 196 744 0 (132)|420,045 145,916 1 473,453 11,736 44,572 808| |Gross value 1,081,868 46,089 (3,259) (11,516) 1,057 (7,083) (8,964) (1,662)|1,096,531| |Concessions, patents and software (76,304) 1,540 (21,055) (4,301) (405) (99) 439 (105) Leasehold rights (82) (2) 82 Business goodwill/client relationships (52,261) (22,522) 1,193 (40) 517 (2) Other intangible assets (9) 174 (7) (100) 1 (2)|(100,289) (1) (73,115) 57| |Accumulated amortisation (128,656) 1,714 (43,584) (4,301) 688 (140) 957 82 (109)|(173,348)| |Trademarks 426,298 (6,000) 582 (3,100) 2,265 Concessions, patents and software 35,784 1,958 (49) (21,055) (4,301) 582 75 (42) 32,675 Leasehold rights 8,632 250 (8,882) Business goodwill/client relationships 429,531 1,322 (22,522) (5,808) 240 (2,983) 557 Other intangible assets 7,906 5,028 (1,495) (10) 399 (41) Intangible assets in progress 44,861 36,787 20 (37,096) Advances and downpayments on intangible assets 196 744 0 (132)|420,045 45,627 ( 0) 400,338 11,787 44,572 808| |Total intangible assets, net 953,208 46,089 (1,544) (43,587) (4,301) (10,827) 917 (6,125) (8,882) (1,772)|923,177| ----- ###### Other intangible assets Other intangible assets essentially comprise the cost of acquiring new business. The €5 million increase in this item during the period reflects the capitalisation of the costs of acquiring new mandates, rebilled to other firms in the network. Decreases totalling €1.5 million relate to the retirement of these costs for lots that were not secured in the period. Intangible assets in progress Intangible assets in progress include various Group projects that can be capitalised. At 31 December 2019, the main contributors to this item are Foncia Groupe for €22.5 million in relation to IT projects, Foncia Stark for €17 million in relation to the development of the Millenium software, and Seiitra for €2 million in relation to the Powimo project.

Changes in the scope of consolidation chiefly concern IT equipment resulting from businesses acquired (Gribi for €0.4 million and Sigla for €0.2 million). |Depreciation/ Property, plant and equipment Monetary Decreases/ impairment Change in First-time Translation Assets Other 31 Dec. 2018 scope of application of classified as (€ thousands) investments disposals adjustments changes Ordinary Exceptional consolidation IFRS 16 held for sale|31 Dec. 2019| |---|---| |Land 36 (8) 40 Buildings 4,550 380 (300) 1,159 59 (119) Fixtures and fittings 78,613 5,149 (8,555) 5,778 112 (26) 673 Machinery and equipment 70,345 7,361 (3,307) 4,475 (13,446) 151 (1) 5,768 Other property, plant and equipment 7 Property, plant and equipment in progress 726 719 5 (187) Advances and downpayments on property, plant 150 1,796 (475) and equipment|68 5,729 81,744 71,346 7 1,263 1,471| |Gross value 154,427 15,405 ( 12,170) 11,452 (13,446) 327 (27) 5,660|161,628| |Buildings (3,365) 300 (240) (1) (378) (34) (69) Fixtures and fittings (55,875) 8,501 (4,518) (999) (4,366) (79) 10 280 Machinery and equipment (52,310) 2,937 (7,055) (128) (3,231) 7,189 (97) (40) Other property, plant and equipment 6 (6)|(3,787) (57,047) (52,735)| |Accumulated depreciation (111,551) 11,738 (11,807) (1,134) (7,975) 7,189 (210) 10 171|(113,569)| |Fixtures and fittings (276) 253|(23)| |Accumulated impairment (276) 253|(23)| |Land 36 (8) 40 Buildings 1,185 380 (240) (1) 781 25 (188) Fixtures and fittings 22,462 5,149 (54) (4,518) (746) 1,412 32 (16) 953 Machinery and equipment (including assets held 18,035 7,361 (370) (7,055) (128) 1,244 (6,257) 54 (1) 5,728 under finance leases) Other property, plant and equipment 7 6 (6) Property, plant and equipment in progress 726 719 5 (187) Advances and downpayments on property, plant 150 1,796 (475) and equipment|68 1,942 24,674 18,611 7 1,263 1,471| |Total property, plant and equipment, net 42,601 15,405 (432) (11,807) (881) 3,477 (6,257) 116 (17) 5,831|48,036| ----- ###### Property, plant and equipment in progress Other changes relate to the commissioning of fittings work.

These contracts are managed using a dynamic approach directly in line with the operating performance of the Group’s branch network and its real estate strategy. In France, around 808 property leases were included in this caption, of which more than 44% are automatically renewable. At 1 January 2019, the most important such leases relate to the head office at Antony, Esset Management’s premises at Aubervilliers, and the Boulevard Haussmann and Boulevard de Courcelles premises in Paris. Changes in the period can be explained as follows:  Changes in the scope of consolidation concern property leases taken on from the various companies acquired in the period, notably Sigla (€3.8 million), Bourgeois Immobilier (€1.9 million) and OTIM (€1.3 million).  Reductions in the lease term mainly relate to the derecognition of Esset Management’s Aubervilliers lease for €8.7 million (the company moved its premises to Courbevoie at the end of the year) and to the early derecognition of the Foncia Paris Rive Droite lease at 6-8 boulevard Haussmann in Paris for €4 million.  New leases for €32.9 million concern a total of 53 new contracts. However, the six main leases account for almost 64% of right-of-use assets. These include the lease of the Rue Raymond Losserand premises in Paris for €7.5 million and the lease of Esset Management’s new premises in Courbevoie for €6.7 million. For the vehicle fleet in France, the first-time application of IFRS 16 resulted in the reclassification of CIC lease contracts measured at €2.6 million under IAS 17 and the measurement of 188 Arval contracts for €1.7 million at 1 January 2019. New leases concern 860 new vehicles delivered by Arval in 2019, which had a €5 million impact on lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Reductions in the lease term relate to the derecognition of 570 CIC vehicle leases, with only two vehicles under CIC leases still on the road at 31 December 2019. |First-time Change in Right-of-use assets Remeasurements Reductions in Depreciation/ Translation application of New leases Retirements scope of Other changes (€ thousands) (increase in value) lease term impairment adjustments IFRS 16 consolidation|31 Dec. 2019| |---|---| |Property leases 122,029 33,421 (1,498) 6,113 (15,588) 13,978 247 (4,699) Vehicles 10,574 5,008 (148) (5,747) 37 (66) Photocopiers 5,284 150 (871) 7 Other property, plant and equipment 331 120 4|154,003 9,658 4,570 455| |Gross value 137,886 38,910 (2,517) 6,113 (21,335) 14,098 295 (4,764)|168,686| |Property leases (82) 1,249 (36,248) 113 (51) 4,732 Vehicles (4,729) 148 3,479 (2,964) 7 (25) (44) Photocopiers (2,460) 871 (1,125) (3) Other property, plant and equipment (62) (1)|(30,288) (4,127) (2,717) (63)| |Accumulated depreciation/impairment (7,271) 1,019 4,728 (40,398) 120 (80) 4,688|(37,194)| |Right-of-use assets, net 130,616 38,910 (1,498) 6,113 (16,608) (40,398) 14,218 215 (76)|131,492| |Property leases 121,947 33,421 (1,498) 6,113 (14,340) (36,248) 14,091 196 33 Of which France 108,129 32,907 (1,498) 6,113 (14,340) (31,390) 11,760 33 Of which Switzerland 10,858 313 (3,584) 1,787 196 0 Of which Germany 1,535 141 (936) 543 Of which Belgium 1,425 60 (338) Vehicles 5,845 5,008 (2,268) (2,964) 7 12 (109) Of which France 4,303 5,008 (2,268) (2,313) Of which Switzerland 1,360 (558) 12 (84) Of which Germany 182 (94) 7 (25) Photocopiers 2,824 150 (1,125) 4 Other property, plant and equipment 331 (62) 120 3|123,715 111,715 9,569 1,283 1,148 5,531 4,731 730 70 1,853 393| |Right-of-use assets, net 130,616 38,910 (1,498) 6,113 (16,608) (40,398) 14,218 215 (76)|131,492| ----- ###### 4.4.2.

Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €2.9 million reflect the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities on the Foncia Pierre Gestion trademark and client relationships. Other non-monetary changes representing a negative amount of €3.3 million concern: (i) deferred tax liabilities recognised by Lodgis for €1 million following the finalisation of the purchase price accounting process and the recognition of a trademark and software for a total of €4 million; (ii) the reclassification of tax representing a negative amount of €1.6 million, recorded against deferred taxes on other adjustments. Changes in deferred taxes on other adjustments attributable to changes in the scope of consolidation for €6.9 million reflect the cancellation of existing business goodwill in the individual statement of financial position of companies consolidated for the first time during the period.

The applicable terms and conditions for these new tranches are closely aligned with those of the term loan B. The characteristics of the Group’s main financing facilities are set out below in Note 4.12.3. The fees for these two operations represented €3.1 million and €0.8 million, respectively, and will be recognised over the residual term of the debt by adjusting financial expenses using the effective interest rate method.  The Group also extended the amount available for drawdown under its revolving credit facility by €70 million, bringing the total amount of the facility (including the authorised overdraft) to €220 million. The fees for this operation represented €650,000. At 31 December 2019, the revolving credit facility had been repaid in full. It should also be noted that the 2015 CICE prefinancing credit was refunded in 2019 in an amount of €7.8 million. Following the Group’s 22 May 2019 acquisition of the 55% stake in the Initiative et Partenaire sub-group that it did not already own, the €3.2 million liability representing the minority put was reversed against consolidated equity. Similarly, the earn-out on FIPM shares was cleared in February 2019 for €3 million. Update on the financial liabilities recognised in respect of the preferred shares issued within the scope of the Leemo/Primonial transaction By way of reminder, at 31 December 2018 these preferred shares were classified within financial liabilities by default and included within net debt for €7 million, since the basis on which the shares issued within the scope of the aforementioned transaction could be converted did not represent a fixed basis. At the end of each reporting period, the Group is required to assess the convertibility of these preferred shares in 2021, which depends on changes in the respective contributions of the Foncia Group and Primonial to Leemo’s net revenue. An analysis of each group’s contribution could allow either (i) Primonial to increase its interest in Leemo to a maximum of 48,457 shares (49% of the share capital), or (ii) the Foncia Group to collect up to €2 million in cash compensation. Based on 2019 revenue, the situation favours the Foncia Group. However, a conservative approach was adopted when preparing the 2019 financial statements and no receivable was recognised. ----- ###### 4.12.2.

A provision is set aside for all outstanding obligations, estimated based on rights accrued and salary projections, taking into account mortality rates, employee turnover and a discount assumption. For France, the increase in provisions for retirement benefits is mainly attributable to the service cost totalling €1.3 million, reflecting the increase in the net obligation resulting from the contributions of Foncia personnel in 2019. Net actuarial gains of €0.5 million reflect: (i) an increase of €0.8 million in the obligation attributable to new beneficiaries resulting from companies acquired in 2018; (ii) a decrease of €0.3 million related to the revised turnover table based on actual employee turnover rates in the 2013-2018 period. It should be specified that in accordance with IAS 19, this table only reflects natural attrition and therefore excludes lay-offs and terminations by mutual agreement (rupture conventionnelle). These actuarial gains are recognised in consolidated equity net of tax. The increase in long-service awards essentially results from actuarial gains of €1 million. These actuarial gains are attributable to various factors, including: (i) €0.7 million related to experience adjustments (owing mainly to new beneficiaries resulting from companies acquired in 2018); (ii) €0.4 million related to the revised turnover table, which takes into account forced departures. The take-up rate for long-service awards has been set at 100%, as in 2018. Obligations in respect of long-service awards are included within other long-term benefits in accordance with IAS 19. In this respect, any actuarial gains and losses are to be taken to profit or loss in the period. Since these actuarial gains and losses result from exceptional events, they were included in non-recurring operating items. |Interest cost net of Contributions Change in Employee benefits Actuarial gains Exchange 31 Dec. 2018 Service cost the return on plan paid in the scope of (€ thousands) and losses differences assets period consolidation|31 Dec. 2019| |---|---| |France 13,944 1,277 207 (229) 541 (60) Belgium 33 Switzerland 5,847 2,393 55 (2,366) 2,738 339 2,903 Germany 851 100|15,679 33 11,908 951| |Total provisions for retirement benefits and other 20,675 3,670 362 (2,595) 3,278 339 2,843 employee benefits|28,572| |France 4,968 460 144 (501) 1,035 (11)|6,102| |Total provisions for long-service awards 4,968 460 144 (501) 1,035 (11)|6,102| ||| |Total employee benefits 25,643 4,130 506 (3,096) 4,313 339 2,832|34,673| ----- ###### In Switzerland, the increase in provisions over the period chiefly reflects the measurement of net benefit obligations relating to the acquired companies Gribi and Guinnard, representing €2.8 million and €0.1 million, respectively (127 employees at Gribi and 7 at Guinnard), along with €2.8 million in net actuarial losses resulting from: (i) an increase of €5.9 million in benefit obligations owing to the change in the discount rate from 0.90% to 0.20%; (ii) a decrease of €4.8 million in benefit obligations owing to a better-than-expected return on plan assets; (iii) an experience loss of €1.8 million.

They accused the Group of wrongful termination and various breaches of the franchise agreements. Of the 21 initial lawsuits representing an aggregate €19.3 million, disputes with only seven franchisees were still ongoing at the reporting date, representing €4.5 million. At 31 December 2019, the provision set aside in respect of these disputes was reduced to €0.5 million. In January 2020, an initial decision was handed down in favour of Foncia Franchise, in which the court dismissed all of the franchisee’s claims (including those that had been successful in first instance). The six other disputes will be heard by the same court between end-May and end-June 2020.  Update on the ORPI dispute A preliminary agreement was negotiated with ORPI providing for the payment of €0.5 million in compensation to settle the dispute between four Foncia entities and ORPI. The related provision was written back in full at 31 December 2019. Changes in provisions for employee disputes Provisions for employee disputes concerned 98 lawsuits compared to 108 lawsuits at 31 December 2018. Out of the 98 lawsuits, 27 are in progress and relate to amounts in excess of €100,000. In all, the claims represent approximately €13.3 million. The resolution of employee disputes in the period resulted in expenses of €0.8 million and a write-back of €1.6 million from the provision. Changes in provisions for URSSAF social security audits This caption includes provisions for URSSAF audits that had been measured in the opening statement of financial position after a risk was identified on benefits in kind for €0.9 million. Since a portion of the reassessment risk has exceeded the statute of limitations, the Group partially wrote back this provision, with the resulting €0.5 million reversal recorded in non-recurring operating items. ----- ###### Trade and other payables Change in Change in Trade and other payables** Translation Assets classified Other",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

At 31 December 2019, the balance of client accounts and “Article 55” transaction accounts therefore represents all of the transactions carried out for each client account. This balance totalled €530.9 million, reported under assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2019. France’s ALUR law requires the use of separate accounts for jointly owned properties comprising more than 15 main lots as from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, Foncia decided not to present separate accounts for its joint ownership association management activities in its statement of financial position. The ordinance dated 31 October 2019 now requires separate accounts to be established for all jointly owned properties by 31 December 2020 at the latest. As a result, funds held in respect of jointly owned properties are expected to decrease sharply in 2020. The statement of financial position does not include any amount for Germany or Belgium, which only use separate accounts.

The tax group reported consolidated tax income of €2 million for 2019, notably reflecting the add-back of €13.9 million in non-deductible financial expenses (tax base) and the utilisation of €7.3 million in tax losses carried forward by the tax consolidation group (tax base). |Other financial income and expenses 2019 2018 (€ thousands)|Change| |---|---| |Foreign exchange gains (losses) ( 0) 573 Net interest cost on pension and other employee benefit (506) (336) obligations Capital gains (losses) on financial disposals less costs to 355 (2) sell Net impairment of financial assets (269) 100 Gains (losses) on available-for-sale financial assets 287 961 Discounting cost, net 1,088 (469) Miscellaneous 32 45 Other (762) (1,790)|(573) (170) 357 (369) (675) 1,557 (13) 1,029| |Other financial income and expenses 193 (963)|1,156| |Income tax benefit (expense) 2019 2018 (€ thousands)|Change| |---|---| |Current tax expense excluding CVAE tax on value added (7,372) (2,222) Of which income tax expense relating to the tax consolidation group (1,958) Of which reclassification of provision for Esset Management tax (408) Of which income tax expense excluding the tax consolidation group (2,903) (899) Of which income tax expense relating to foreign companies (2,103) (1,323) CVAE tax on value added (9,841) (8,955) Deferred taxes 14,737 (3,820) Of which impact of change in French tax rate (liability method) 15,769 15,640 Of which other impacts (1,032) (19,459)|(6,036) (1,958) (408) (2,004) (780) (886) 18,557 129 18,428| |Income tax benefit (expense) (2,476) (14,997)|12,521| ----- ###### Current income tax expense excluding the tax consolidation group essentially concerns Foncia Pierre Gestion for €1.2 million and Foncia Brette for €0.5 million. Current income tax expense for foreign companies relates mainly to Switzerland for €1.1 million and Belgium for €0.9 million. A provision for tax contingencies was set aside by Esset Management on 18 December 2019 after the company received notification from the French tax authorities of a tax reassessment related mainly to unjustified expenses. This provision has been reclassified within current income tax expense in accordance with IAS 12. Deferred tax income recognised in the year mainly relates to the decrease in the deferred tax rate in France, from 28.92% in 2018 to 25.83% in 2019. Tax loss carry-forwards Tax loss carry-forwards within the tax consolidation group at 31 December 2019 are as follows (after utilisation in the current period): • Loss arising on tax consolidation: €16.6 million. This tax loss has been recognised in full in view of the high probability that sufficient future taxable profit will exist against which it can be utilised. • Proprietary tax losses of consolidated companies: €20.7 million, of which €20 million were not recognised, mainly relating to Foncia Holding (€8.9 million), IDHA (€4.8 million) and Syndic+ (€2.8 million). New deductibility rules for financial expenses in France New rules applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 redefine the applicable framework for deductible financial expenses in France. The new rules are designed to implement Article 4 of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) into French law. Financial expenses were previously deductible at a single rate of 75% (“rabot” rule). This single rate has been replaced by a new approach introducing a cap to be calculated for each company or each tax consolidation group, as applicable. Although the tax group is thinly capitalised on the basis of debt-to-equity rules, its debt-to-equity ratio is lower than that of the consolidated group. Accordingly, it deducted financial expenses at the statutory rate of 30% of its taxable EBITDA. By demonstrating its “financial independence” and therefore its eligibility for the safeguard clause, the tax consolidation group was granted an additional right to deduction representing up to 75% of net non-deducted expenses. Impact of the decrease in the income tax rate on deferred tax liabilities In line with the phased reduction in income tax in France through to 2022 (2020 budget), the Group cut its deferred tax rate for French entities to 25.83% from 28.92% previously. In accordance with IAS 12, adjustments related to this change in the tax rate are accounted for in a symmetrical manner and mainly included in profit or loss (when they relate to items themselves recognised in profit or loss). Taking into account a target tax rate for deferred tax bases resulted in a reduction of €15.8 million in net deferred tax liabilities and led to a corresponding increase in profit under the liability method. This significant decrease is attributable to a change in management’s assessment of projected cuts in this tax rate, finally agreed in 2018 after various postponements that had cast doubt on its introduction, and to the long-term timeframe for disposing of intangible assets. ----- ###### 5.11.2.

FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE Interest rate risk The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises mainly on its borrowings. These borrowings are denominated solely in euros and are managed on a centralised basis. They are mainly indexed to 3-month Euribor. The risk management policy is set by management. Cash flow surpluses and working capital requirements for the Group’s companies are centralised under a cash pooling agreement and managed by the Group’s Treasury department. The Group’s Treasury department selects investment vehicles for cash surpluses – either for proprietary cash or client cash (excluding separate accounts) – within the framework set by the management policy, which prioritises liquidity and security. Interest received is indexed to 3-month Euribor or is at fixed rates (term accounts). At 31 December 2019, interest rate risks can be broken down by management outlook as follows, taking into account interest rate maturities applied to the asset/liability financing position:",N/A,as_expected,2021,772

The two caps in place fix the maximum 3-month Euribor rate at 1.5% and 1.25%, respectively. Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to two types of foreign exchange risk: - A foreign exchange risk on assets resulting from the Foncia Group’s shareholdings in its Swiss subsidiaries: ###### although this risk is measured, it is not subject to specific risk management as the investments are intended to be held over the long term.

This risk arises solely on the business of Swiss subsidiaries and concerns the Swiss franc. Since the vast majority of local transactions are carried out in Swiss francs, this risk is not material. It should be noted that Foncia signed an amendment to the agreement for the loan granted by Foncia Groupe to its subsidiary Foncia Switzerland on 29 June 2018, eliminating all repayment clauses. Given that no repayments have been made and that no repayment plan has been set for the foreseeable future, this loan is now considered as a monetary item and as part of the net investment in Foncia Switzerland as quasi-equity, in accordance with IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Since this date, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the loan have been included in other comprehensive income (equity) under foreign currency translation reserves. NOTE 9.

LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Update on the UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) dispute On 1 October 2014, UFC-Que Choisir (UFC) brought proceedings against Foncia Groupe before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance (regional court) seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by lessees of Foncia-managed properties who were unduly charged for receiving notices to pay (avis d’échéance). More specifically, UFC is seeking payment from Foncia Groupe of an amount of €2.30 per month and per lessee over a period of five years and estimates the number of lessees concerned at 318,400, bringing the total damages to €44 million. In its defence, the Group argues that the French law of 6 July 1989 on residential lease agreements, upon which basis UFC filed its claim, made no provision for class actions at the time of the alleged offence; that no law existed preventing lessees being charged for receiving notices to pay; and that this was therefore a lawful practice. Oral arguments were exchanged before the Nanterre Tribunal de Grande Instance in March 2018. The decision handed down in May 2018 dismissed UFC’s claims on the grounds that they fell outside the scope of a class action. UFC has appealed the decision and the hearings before the Court of Appeal are scheduled for 23 April 2020. The Group considers that no provision needs to be accrued in this respect in its financial statements at 31 December 2019. NOTE 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Signing of a preliminary agreement to sell Foncia Primaliance shares Following the 1 August 2019 signing of an agreement in principle with a major asset manager in France, the Group signed the preliminary agreement for the sale of Foncia Primaliance shares on 6 March 2020. Covid-19 epidemic Context The unprecedented public health crisis caused by the Covid-19 epidemic that has spread across the globe is affecting economies and businesses around the world and having significant impacts on all industries and geographic areas. Governments have taken steps to address the crisis. The impacts of the epidemic include:  direct and immediate impacts on certain business activities owing to the fall in demand for certain services;  widespread impacts such as the temporary closure of premises, disruptions in the supply chain, the unavailability of human resources and the potential liquidity difficulties of certain debtors;  more generally, a downturn in the economy as a whole, with considerable uncertainty as to the length and severity of the disruption. ----- ###### Consequences of the impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic on the financial statements at 31 December 2019 Based on the situation at 31 December 2019 (i.e., limited cases of the virus and the lack of any global health warning by the World Health Organization (WHO) at that date), the Group considers that the consequences of the public health and economic crisis caused by Covid-19 relate to the 2020 financial period and do not confirm a situation existing prior to 31 December 2019, insofar as the events create a situation that did not exist at 31 December 2019 and which does not compromise the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern (the most important measures of the business continuity plan put in place by management are presented below). Accordingly, the amounts reported at 31 December 2019 may not be adjusted. Consequences of the impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic on the Group’s businesses in 2020 In accordance with the decisions taken by the government in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all Foncia Group premises (branches and head offices) are closed to the public until further notice, as well as to employees (barring exceptional cases). Real estate agents can no longer travel to sign mandates, make visits or meet with notaries. The general lockdown measures imposed on the French population have effectively frozen the property market and the transactions business is virtually at a standstill. Physical visits of properties are forbidden during the lockdown period and those that had been scheduled were cancelled. The rental market is also affected by the crisis, as the removal industry along with the utility vehicle rental business are severely disrupted, effectively blocking the departure and arrival of lessees. The rental management market can continue to function normally from a purely administrative perspective. There is little movement in rental properties. However, there is a significant risk that fees on unpaid rent will be collected later than expected, even though rent must still be paid by law. The jointly owned property management business remains and will remain fairly sheltered from the crisis, although it may generate an increased workload from an administrative, legal and commercial perspective. The chain of continuity for services continues to function, despite delays regarding joint ownership property charges. However, the Group expects a fall in revenue from incidental fees such as for transfers or renovation work. It should be noted that several ordinances have been issued by the French government to protect and support companies operating in the real estate sector. One of these ordinances concerns the guaranteed continuity of mandates for jointly owned property associations, even if they expire in the period from 12 March to 31 December 2020. Without compromising the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, direct impacts are expected and have already been observed in 2020 on revenue, margins and operating cash flows relating to the transactions and lettings businesses and, to a lesser extent, to the French and international jointly owned property business. Business continuity plan  Human resources and organisation The different procedures put in place to address this unprecedented environment are designed to protect the health of employees but also to ensure that a minimum and critical level of business can continue, subject to changes in government regulations: • Homeworking has been introduced for all employees whose work can be performed from home and who have the necessary tools available. • More specifically, in its property management and transactions network, an exceptional travel certificate has been granted to managers so that they can carry out minimum duties alongside senior executives. An exceptional, occasional travel certificate subject to restrictions has also been issued to critical employees dealing, for example, with incoming correspondence, cash inflows and payments, and handovers. • For employees facing increasingly difficult working conditions such as lettings negotiators, developers or real estate consultants, short-time working arrangements have been put in place. ----- ###### Each department is currently finalising its own organisational and communications guidelines for these exceptional circumstances using various procedures.  Financing Out of prudence, the Group made two drawdowns on its revolving credit facility on 16 and 19 March 2020 for a total of €190 million in order to secure its liquidity. Certain due dates for payments under major leases have been pushed back in order to protect cash levels, particularly in the transactions business.  External growth strategy Wherever possible, the Group has pushed back corporate sale agreements due to be signed during the lockdown period to 1 June 2020 at the earliest.

The Group also estimated the value of the Brolliet trademark at CHF €13.7 million (i.e., €12.1 million at 31 December 2018). Concessions, patents and software Concessions, patents and software include the systems measured within the scope of Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting at €16.2 million. Investments in the period amounting to €2.7 million mainly concern Foncia Groupe for €1.6 million. Other changes amounting to €17 million chiefly concern the capitalisation of intangible assets in progress for €13.8 million, along with a €2.4 million adjustment to amortisation charged against software included in Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting. Business goodwill/client relationships At the time of Foncia Management’s purchase price accounting, the fair value of the Foncia Group’s client relationships was estimated at €460.8 million, breaking down between the Group’s three CGUs as follows: (i) Property Management France (excluding the Transactions business): €396.2 million, (ii) Property Management International (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium): €2.2 million, and (iii) Services: €62.5m. Following the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Brolliet group in September 2016, client relationships were valued at CHF 7.5 million (€6.6 million at 31 December 2018). Investments totalling €5.6 million primarily relate to acquisitions of business goodwill over the period. Changes in the scope of consolidation representing €7 million reflect Primonial’s contribution of its entire stand-alone division as part of the business combination with Leemo (see Note 2.3 of “Highlights of the period”). Other intangible assets Other intangible assets essentially comprise the cost of acquiring new business. The €3.8 million increase in this item in the period reflects the capitalisation of the costs of acquiring new mandates, rebilled to other firms in the network. |Other Change in scope Intangible assets Monetary Decreases/ Amortisation/ Translation Other 31 Dec. 2017 non- monetary of (€ thousands) investments disposals impairment adjustments changes increases consolidation|31 Dec. 2018| |---|---| |Trademarks 426,196 520 (418) Concessions, patents and software 100,803 2,655 (936) 695 106 8,764 Lease rights 8,789 68 (567) 422 1 Business goodwill/client relationships 467,729 5,439 220 (2) 6,995 283 1,129 Other intangible assets 4,727 3,830 (661) 10 12 Intangible assets in progress 29,497 29,472 (368) 15 (13,755) Advances and downpayments on intangible assets 141 173 0 (118)|426,298 112,088 8,714 481,793 7,918 44,861 196| |Gross value 1,037,882 41,638 220 (2,534) 8,122 926 (4,386)|1,081,868| |Concessions, patents and software (68,544) 925 (16,285) (607) (59) 8,266 Lease rights (100) (17) (16) (1) 53 Business goodwill/client relationships (29,433) (22,599) (27) (202) Other intangible assets (5) (6) (2)|(76,304) (82) (52,261) (13)| |Accumulated amortisation (98,082) 925 (38,907) (625) (87) 8,117|(128,660)| |Trademarks 426,196 102 0 Concessions, patents and software 32,259 2,655 (11) (16,285) 88 47 17,031 Lease rights 8,689 68 (567) (17) 406 53 Business goodwill/client relationships 438,295 5,439 220 (2) (22,599) 6,995 256 927 Other intangible assets 4,722 3,830 (661) (6) 8 12 Intangible assets in progress 29,497 29,472 (368) 15 (13,755) Advances and downpayments on intangible assets 141 173 0 (118)|426,298 35,784 8,632 429,532 7,905 44,861 196| |Total intangible assets, net 939,800 41,638 220 (1,609) (38,907) 7,497 420 4,150|953,208| ----- ###### Intangible assets in progress Intangible assets in progress include various Group projects that can be capitalised.

This repayment was financed by subscribing to a new €80 million tranche (“B4”) of its senior facility. The issuance fees for the new tranche amount to €1.2 million and will be recognised over the term of the facility by an adjustment to financial expenses at the effective interest rate as calculated at 3 August 2018 (3.68%). The initial accounting treatment was discontinued, with all related unamortised expenses allocated to the ICA loan (€4 million) charged to profit or loss under “Cost of net debt” (see Note 5.9). Since 15 March 2018, the Group has continuously drawn on its revolving credit facility as part-financing for its external growth investments (acquisitions). The Group also draws on its €30 million authorised overdraft facility when necessary. Liabilities relating to the put option granted to Trévi non-controlling shareholders (on 8% of the shares) and to the non-controlling shareholders of the Initiatives group and partners (on 55% of the shares) were remeasured based on actual 2018 figures against equity. Following the acquisition of an additional 25% stake in Somhome in March 2018, the €0.6 million liability relating to the put option granted to non-controlling interests was reversed against total equity. 4.11.2.

The decrease in provisions for retirement benefits and long-service awards in France is a result of the new IPM wage agreements that came into force. The decrease in the Group’s benefit obligation in Switzerland during the period mainly corresponds to the €2.5 million in past service costs (around 27% of the net benefit obligation at 1 January 2018), following the pooling of employees’ supplemental health, life and disability insurance plans into a single fund as opposed to many different collective funds as was previously the case. |Interest cost net of Contributions Change in Employee benefits Actuarial gains Exchange 31 Dec. 2017 Service cost the return on plan paid in the Past service cost scope of (€ thousands) and losses differences assets period consolidation France 15,038 1,195 203 (939) (1,365) (188) Belgium 33 Switzerland 9,112 2,762 51 (2,014) (2,530) (1,732) 198 Germany 880 11 (40)|31 Dec. 2018| |---|---| ||13,944 33 5,847 851| |Total provisions for retirement benefits and other 25,063 3,957 265 (2,953) (3,895) (1,960) 198 employee benefits|20,675| |France 5,651 439 69 (538) (679) 23 5|4,968| |Total provisions for long-service awards 5,651 439 69 (538) (679) 23 5|4,968| |Total employee benefits 30,714 4,396 334 (3,491) (4,574) (1,937) 198 5|25,643| ----- ###### The amount shown for the past service cost also follows a subsequent decision taken by the Board of the fund to reduce the pension conversion rate in order to ensure its long-term viability.

This enables the Group to determine the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The maximum term of claims is 180 days. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated). Provisions for labour disputes concerned 108 lawsuits compared to 117 lawsuits at 31 December 2017. Out of the 108 lawsuits, 32 relate to amounts in excess of €100,000. In all, the claims represent approximately €10 million. The resolution of labour disputes in the period resulted in expenses of €1.1 million and a writeback of €1.9 million from the provision.

Lower interest costs on borrowings are linked to the partial early repayment made on 3 August 2018. Drawdowns made on the rollover credit facility since 15 March 2018 lead to much higher interest than in 2017. These interest expenses are partly offset by a decrease in commission on undrawn amounts. Issuance fees for the syndicated loan totalling €30.1 million at 31 December 2018 are recognised over the term of the loan by adjusting the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability to the financial liability’s carrying amount.

The new group opted for a tax loss carry-forward system along the lines of the former tax consolidation group, but with a broader scope. In 2018, the tax consolidation group benefited from an off-book deduction of €29.9 million in respect of the IFRS 15 impact, recognised in equity in the individual financial statements. This amount had already been subject to tax in 2017. Based on the allocation by the holding company of deductible financial expenses and the deduction of the share of acquisition fees of Foncia Holding securities in an amount of €5.4 million, an additional tax loss of €5.6 million was generated in 2018. Within the tax consolidation group, tax loss carry-forwards at 31 December 2018 are as follows: • Loss arising on tax consolidation: €23.8 million (after a tax loss of €5.6 million generated in respect of 2018). This tax loss has been recognised in full in view of the high probability that sufficient future taxable profit will exist against which it can be utilised. • Proprietary tax losses of consolidated companies: €25.4 million, of which €18.6 million were not recognised, mainly relating to Foncia Holding (€8.9 million), IDHA (€4.8 million) and Foncia Développement (€2.8 million). ----- ###### It should be recalled that in 2017, the Group was eligible for relief in respect of the CVAE in the amount of €7 million, further to a claim filed (QPC). Excluding this relief, the CVAE expense for 2017 amounted to €5.1 million. Besides this impact, the €3.8 million increase versus 2017 is notably due to the sustained pace of the Group’s acquisition-led growth.

FINANCIAL RISK EXPOSURE 8.1.1. Interest rate risk The Group’s interest rate risk exposure arises mainly on its borrowings. These borrowings are denominated solely in euros and are managed on a centralised basis. They are mainly indexed to 3-month Euribor. The risk management policy is set by management. Cash flow surpluses and working capital requirements for the Group’s companies are centralised under a cash pooling agreement and managed by the Group’s Treasury department. The Group’s Treasury department selects investment vehicles for cash surpluses – either for proprietary cash or client cash (excluding separate accounts) – within the framework set by the management policy, which prioritises liquidity and security. Interest received is indexed to 3-month Euribor or is at fixed rates (term accounts). At 31 December 2018, interest rate risks can be broken down by management outlook as follows, taking into account interest rate maturities applied to the asset/liability financing position: Credit risk € thousands Client accounts 557,899 - Term accounts (client funds) (176,027) + Net cash and cash equivalents 3,268 Assets 385,140 - Credit line (1,513,760) + Interest rate cap 527,850 - CICE (15,962) Liabilities (1,001,872) Net position (616,732) A sudden 1% increase in short-term interest rates applied to the net position of assets and liabilities affected by interest rate fluctuations at the end of the reporting period would result in a rise of €6,167,000 in financial expenses. In 2018, the Group still has hedges in place for its credit facilities with an underlying valued at €527,850,000.

Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to two types of foreign exchange risk: - A foreign exchange risk on assets resulting from the Foncia Group’s shareholdings in its Swiss subsidiaries. ###### Although this risk is measured, it is not subject to specific risk management as the investments are intended to be held over the long term. At 31 December 2018, the Group’s foreign currency positions were as follows: CHF thousands Assets 327,831 Liabilities 212,001 Net position before hedging 115,830 Forex hedging 0 Net position after hedging 115,830 Currency value 0.8854 Net position after hedging (equivalent value in € thousands) 102,556 Accordingly, the Group’s foreign exchange risk exposure on assets is not material. - A foreign exchange trading risk arising on commercial and financial transactions carried out by the Group’s ###### companies in currencies other than their local currency. This risk arises solely on the business of Swiss subsidiaries and concerns the Swiss franc. Since the vast majority of local transactions are carried out in Swiss francs, this risk is not material. It should be noted that currency options had been set up through to December 2019 to guarantee the CHF/EUR exchange rate with respect to the loans granted by Foncia Groupe to its subsidiary Foncia Suisse. On 29 June 2018, Foncia Groupe unwound its entire CHF 13.7 million forex hedge, generating proceeds of €787,000. Foncia in fact signed an amendment to the loan agreement between Foncia Groupe and Foncia Suisse on 29 June 2018, eliminating all repayment clauses. Given that no repayments have been made and that no repayment plan has been set for the foreseeable future, this loan is considered as a monetary item and as part of the net investment in Foncia Suisse as quasi-equity, in accordance with IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. As from this date, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the loan will be taken to other comprehensive income under translation reserves. |Assets Liabilities Net position before hedging Forex hedging Net position after hedging Currency value Net position after hedging (equivalent value in € thousands)|CHF thousands 327,831 212,001 115,830 0 115,830 0.8854 102,556| |---|---| ----- ###### NOTE 9.
