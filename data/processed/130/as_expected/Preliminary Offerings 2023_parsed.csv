130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are the global leader in the residential real estate services (“RRES”) market by dwellings under management, providing services to both individuals (“business-to-consumer” or “B2C”) and businesses (“business-to-business” or “B2B”), and have also entered the commercial real estate services segment for B2B customers. In 2022, we entered the UK market through the acquisition of FirstPort, the UK’s largest joint property manager (based on units under management), as a result of which we became the largest residential property management company in the world. We assist our residential and commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with competitive and comprehensive service offerings. We provide end-to-end assistance, from managing individual apartments and building areas jointly owned by apartment owners through our Lease Management and Letting and Joint Property Management business lines, respectively, to providing brokerage, digital and ancillary other services such as insurance brokerage, technical diagnostic and energy brokerage through our other business lines. Our RRES business is the leader in France, operating under the Foncia brand through a unique network of over 500 branches. We also hold leading positions in Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK where we operate under various brands. We have expanded our size and reach through bolt-on acquisitions and completed over 330 acquisitions since 2016. In addition to our successful M&A track record, our recent performance has been marked by achievements in operations, digitization, and our IT and communications infrastructure. We believe our success is the result of a unique, integrated ecosystem of real estate services, which provides the opportunity for organic growth via cross-selling of additional services with recurring revenues and external growth through bolt-on acquisitions. We operate an integrated business model across a wide range of real estate services and divide our real estate services into the following businesses: - **French Residential Real Estate Services (representing 57.7% of 9M 2022 revenue) consisting of: - **Joint Property Management (representing 28.6% of 9M 2022 revenue) through which we are mandated by landlords to manage jointly owned building areas and equipment. - **Lease Management and Letting (representing 27.0% of 9M 2022 revenue) through which we manage properties on behalf of landlords and assist landlords and tenants throughout their rental process. - **Residential Services (representing 2.1% of 9M 2022 revenue) through which we provide other ancillary real estate services in France, notably via Constatimmo, Optissimmo and Tech-Way. - **French Real Estate Brokerage (representing 13.3% of 9M 2022 revenue) through which we assist property owners and buyers throughout the real estate sales process. ----- - **French Digital Services (representing 9.5% of 9M 2022 revenue) through which we operate services relying on digital platforms such as online real estate valuation and brokerage services. - **French B2B Services (representing 4.7% of 9M 2022 revenue) through which we provide real estate services to our commercial and institutional customers, as well as adjacent real estate services such as insurance and diagnostics services. - **International Services (representing 14.8% of 9M 2022 revenue) through which we provide the full spectrum of real estate services through our international operations in Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK. As a result of the closing of the FirstPort acquisition in August 2022, our international services business will represent a greater portion of our group revenue going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Sector leadership focused on strongest economies in Western Europe providing competitive advantages,"We have established ourselves as a leader for residential real estate services in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK by delivering high quality, reliable and innovative services uniquely suited to the needs of our customers. As of August 2019, we were the number one player in the French real estate services market, with approximately 13% market share, according to an international report provider. As of September 30, 2022, we managed approximately 2.1 million dwellings in France, which is approximately two times the number of dwellings managed by our next closest competitor according to publically available information for the year ended 2020. Outside of France, we also hold leading positions in Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK. As of September 30, 2022, we operated over 114 branches in these countries, which collectively accounted for 14.8% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In 2022, we entered the UK market through the acquisition of FirstPort, one of the UK’s largest property services groups and the UK’s largest joint property manager with approximately 315,000 units under management as of March 2022, and has a market share of approximately 11%, twice the size of its closest competitor in the UK. FirstPort operates primarily in joint property management as well as in the rental management and real estate brokerage markets in England, Scotland and Wales with a strong geographical national coverage, generating revenue of €120 million in 2021 with the support of over 3,800 employees. FirstPort has an in-house built digital platform which enables it to offer a marketleading, fully automated and scalable service proposition which supports its continuous growth alongside a strong organic development, mobilization of a secured order book (recurring revenue streams with high visibility) and accretive acquisitions. Our scale, operations and service offerings provide us with a clear competitive advantage. Our centralized processes result in lower internal costs and enable improved customer service compared to our typically small, individual-owned competitors. Our comprehensive range of innovative services, such as FONCIA 24/7 (our assistance service for our joint property management customers), and Assurimo (our real estate insurance service), differentiate us from competitors. Our comprehensive network of over 500 branches covering all major French cities is one of the largest offerings in the market and results in close proximity to our customers and the dwellings that we manage; unique market positioning in negotiations with third-party repair and maintenance service suppliers resulting in decreased costs; and financial resources that allow us to expand our customer portfolio through acquisitions. We have been able to successfully enter markets through acquisitions and expanded our operating geography, despite the regulatory and technological requirements that create barriers to participation in the real estate services market. Our regional and national regulatory and real estate industry expertise and our leadership team’s extensive experience in the real estate services industry are key to meeting and complying with such requirements. Our strong reputation for quality, service and multi-branded strategy have also supported our ability to grow in existing markets and enter new markets. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,Loyal and diverse customer base and synergetic business model in an attractive and resilient market,"Our large and diversified client base, integrated ecosystem of residential real estate services and high customer retention rates drive a high level of recurring revenues (75% in 2020 and 72% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022). We have grown our diversified customer base to approximately 1.8 million dwellings in our French Joint Property Management business and over 376,000 dwellings in our French Lease Management business as at September 30, 2022. Through our synergetic business model, we are able to cross sell our services to our diverse customer portfolio across our business lines, which in turn leads to further organic growth. For example, our proven ability to cross-sell is highlighted by the high penetration rates of Assurimo, our specialized property insurance brokerage unit (providing property insurance, homeowners’ insurance policies and brokerage services) through which we currently provide building insurance (multi-risque immeubles) contracts to 49.7% and household insurance (multi-risque _habitation) contracts to 34.3% of our French Joint Property Management buildings, respectively._ Similarly, we currently provide technical services to approximately 104,220 contracts which represent 27.7% of our French RRES Lease Management customers through our dedicated business, Constatimmo. We believe that we are well positioned to target new customers, including B2B customers, given our knowledge regarding fulfilling requirements for our B2C customers. The addressable markets in which we operate are characterized by high outsourcing rates, with a high and stable portion of joint property or condominium owners (85% in France) under external management, as of August 2019 using services like our Joint Property Management business. Property owners tend to rely on expert services such as ours due to the volume of work and amount of legal and accounting know-how required to directly interface with tenants and other counterparties. Moreover, landlords rarely switch leasing managers during a tenancy, given the risks and costs involved in switching service providers and the limited potential benefit, resulting in a high customer net retention rate of 95.1% in our Joint Property Management business and 91.2% in our Lease Management business for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The UK market is also characterized by a loyal customer base, as evidenced by FirstPort with a net retention rate of approximately 98% in the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that through the integrated ecosystem of high-quality services we consistently provide we have established high customer retention rates, and long lasting customer relationships, certain of which last more than 20 years. Moreover, 36.2% of our customers from our Joint Property Management business in France entered into contracts of three or more years and 23.8% for two to three years for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Due to our broad and diverse customer base, we are not reliant on any particular customer. According to an international report provider, the French property management market is estimated to be €12.2 billion in August 2019, of which €5.3 billion is captured by property management companies, with the rest serviced in-house. The externally serviced property management market has grown by approximately 2% annually between 2014 and 2019. This stable growth has been driven by population dynamics and the construction of collective units. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow through acquisition of customer portfolios, cross-selling of related services to our large client base and the addition of new revenue opportunities for our existing services.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,Strong and predictable cash flow generation with an inflation resilient business model,"We have a track record of steady cash flow generation, driven by a high level of recurring revenues, which has enabled us to regularly deleverage. Our trend of high EBITDA conversion rates has continued with a Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate, of approximately 85.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 81.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Despite our regular M&A activity, our discretionary spend on acquisitions provides us with flexibility to manage our cash flow and reduce our financial leverage. Further, our business requires limited maintenance capital expenditures (accounting for approximately 4.2% and 4.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and ----- for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively), and is characterized by limited working capital requirements. Our revenue increased by 12.2% to €943.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, up from €840.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and increased by 19.3% to €1,146.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our margin resilience is supported by an adaptable cost structure for the more cyclical flow Brokerage business, as Brokerage salary costs include a significant variable portion that is indexed on commissions. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 27.7% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 28.2% and 26.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our recurring, stable revenue is in part due to our complementary business profiles across our branches, experienced management and sales force teams, and fee-based services in connection with our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Letting businesses which accounted for 65.2% of our revenue in France for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In addition, our high proportion of recurring revenues (75% in 2020 and 72% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022) and balanced portfolio of services split between stock and flow businesses with limited correlation have supported our resilience during adverse economic conditions, achieving a substantially stable performance in 2020 despite unprecedented government measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our business model is resilient to inflationary pressures, in particular as a result of our ability to pass through a portion of our cost increases and of the limited impact of inflation on our business in general. Most of our contracts are either subject to an annual pricing assessment or contain inflation adjustment mechanisms, which allow us to effectively pass-through inflationary impact to our customers. In addition, our fees are typically derived as a proportion of rent, and we, therefore, benefit from price increases occurring in an inflationary environment. Due to the nature of our business, we have a relatively limited exposure to energy and gas price increases, and the energy saving measures that we have put in place allow us to further mitigate any such impact. We estimate that the negative impact from elevated levels of inflation on EBITDA for our French business in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was approximately €2.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,Continuous investments in operational improvement through technology reinforces our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains,"We continuously invest in cutting edge technology in order to offer the best multi-channel services to our customers. Since 2017, we have upgraded a significant portion of our IT and communication infrastructure including utilizing a mix of integrated and outsourced solutions, transitioning to a single telecom provider, and streamlining our finance and human resources functions with Workday, which enabled us to quickly and effectively transition to a work-from-home environment during the COVID19 pandemic. We have also leveraged our technological know-how combined with our knowledge of the real estate industry to design and launch our new ERP system, Millenium. Millenium integrates all of our IT and resource planning functions into one database to better meet our customers’ needs and address internal business challenges. Millenium increases the digitization of our activities with the aim of helping customers by creating greater transparency and improving our operations with standardized, digital processes to increase efficiency and to improve the speed at which we can serve our customers. We believe our high levels of investment in IT for our corporate platform and customer interface service such as over recent years give us a competitive edge in the current environment. Millenium was piloted at several of our branches in France and launched at all brokerage operations in France in early 2022 prior to the roll-out to our broader network starting in November 2022. Further, we commenced the roll-out of Millenium at our RRES operations which is now in use for 5.6% of our Joint Property Management dwellings and 6.0% of our Lease Management dwellings. We aim to accelerate the rollout of Millenium in the first quarter of 2023. ----- The digitization, standardization and automation offered by Millenium complement our already synergetic business model and will allow us to more quickly leverage our customer database to identify cross-selling opportunities leading to greater operating efficiencies and inter-business synergies. We believe that Millenium’s compatibility with big data, AI and IoT, will allow us to explore new business opportunities and provide access to a number of revenue-enhancing opportunities. For example, we have developed a new operational model called “Agency of the Future” which will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real estate services and aims at improving client satisfaction and reducing our customer churn rate, which we believe will, in turn, lead to greater opportunities for organic growth. Furthermore, we also believe that the gains of Millenium and the development of Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €25.0 million in the next 24 months. We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technology to continually improve our internal operations in order to provide our customers with product offerings that meet their needs and make us the number one choice among residential real estate service providers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

We completed over 330 acquisitions since January 2016, which represented €814.1 million of acquired revenues. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we entered the UK market with the acquisition of FirstPort and we also completed 54 acquisitions in our primary French market and in other geographies, representing 29,069 new Lease Management dwellings and 553,981 new Joint Property Management dwellings and €261.1 million of acquired revenues. These 55 acquisitions contributed to our Adjusted EBITDA, which reached €409.9 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to €348.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Consolidation is a natural trend in the highly fragmented markets we operate in, accelerated by increasing regulations, and we play a key role in the market by defining new quality standards and unrivalled execution processes. We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is dedicated to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our five geographical regions, which we plan to expand in the UK. Our long-standing integration experience, including a dedicated post-acquisition integration team, enables us to extract full synergy potential from acquired businesses, with both cross-selling and cost synergies. We have identified a number of potential targets in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK to continue growing and, importantly, reinforcing our leadership in the market.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Our management team comes from various industries and geographies and is supported by four heads of region in France and four heads of region in international markets, who have extensive experience in real estate and enable us to provide our customers with tailored expertise and service. We believe that the collective industry knowledge and leadership of our management team positions them well to continue our successful organic and external growth and execute our strategies. Further, our management team encourages growth through a focus on operational efficiency and innovation including through the management’s dynamic external growth policy that enabled us to, among others, establish our market leading presence in the UK, Benelux, Switzerland and Germany, successfully divest our non-core businesses to focus on our core, synergetic businesses and more recently, by the ongoing overhaul of our IT infrastructure, including the development and deployment of Millenium and enabling our planned transition to our new operational model, “Agency of the Future.” This is demonstrated by the consistent increase in our revenues which increased by 12.2% to €943.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, up from €840.9 million for the nine months ended ----- September 30, 2021 and increased by 19.3% to €1,146.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Our most recent digital innovation, Millenium, an in-house developed ERP system that is cloud-based and will allow us to fully digitalize our businesses. We believe that Millenium will allow us to better, more efficiently serve our customers, cross-sell across our services and therefore capture greater market share from existing customers and generate business from new customers. Our IT and data platforms are subject to a process of continuous improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investments, such as the team of 68 developers we hired in connection with the development of Millenium. We believe that our robust investments in our IT and data platforms provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses have been required to transition to a work-from-home environment. Additionally, our ongoing and historical use of big data, AI and IoT to create new business opportunities enables us to maintain a cutting edge development program while minimizing the risks traditionally associated with experimentation. For example, we have developed our new operational model, Agency of the Future, which we believe will generate significant savings, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain tasks that were previously done manually, such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges. Since 2018, we have invested approximately €155.0 million into our IT projects, and we believe that the gains of Millenium and Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €25.0 million in the next 24 months. We have developed, and continue to develop, innovative solutions based on emerging trends that are aimed at providing our customers with the highest quality, optimal solutions for their real estate needs.

We have been successful in achieving incremental organic revenue growth through active cross selling efforts across our ancillary services. We intend to continue to benefit from this growth through expanding our service offerings by introducing new business lines. In addition, we aim to further reduce our customer churn rate in Joint Property Management by improving client satisfaction, including as a result of the overhaul of our IT systems and operating model. In addition, we have made, and intend to continue to make, selected bolt-on acquisitions in our core French market and the other geographies in which we operate to supplement our organic growth, solidify our current market position and expand our presence. We have a strong track record of successfully identifying, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions. From January 2016 to September 2022, we completed over 330 acquisitions. We believe that our strong brand, broad platform and our dynamic infrastructure have allowed us to generate growth and operating cash flows through acquisitions. Recent examples of targeted acquisitions in France that have accelerated our growth and have allowed us to better address customer needs include Billon and AGDA, in our RRES business, Humakey in B2B and in Belgium, with Syncura. We intend to continue to further strengthen our strong position in the market by pursuing opportunistic acquisitions in our existing geographies to accelerate our growth, and we aim to do so by leveraging our internal expertise. ----- We have an M&A team that is dedicated to identifying growth opportunities.

Tech-Way provides actionable advice and sustainable solutions for pest control, fire protection, routine maintenance and repair work.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.4,Continue to grow internationally,"We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our geographic footprint in Europe, organically and through targeted and opportunistic acquisitions. We intend to leverage our expertise and know-how as well as our highly localized real estate providers to penetrate European markets where there is an unmet demand and an opportunity for further expansion, as evidenced by factors such as population dynamics and the construction of collective units, accompanied by increases in price and service level and a higher degree of outsourcing driven by regulatory changes. We strategically pursue new markets while remaining committed to expanding in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK as these markets offer us proximity to existing customers and expansion opportunities in countries where we have established brand recognition. In 2022, we entered the UK market through the acquisition of FirstPort, one of the UK’s largest property services groups and the UK’s largest joint property manager with approximately 315,000 units under management as of March 2022. With this acquisition, Emeria became the global leader in residential property management as well as the number one player in the largest European markets: the UK, France and Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our strategic focus on the expansion of our geographical footprint in Europe would have allowed us to generate approximately €274 million of International Revenue, taking into account FirstPort as if the acquisition of FirstPort had closed on January 1, 2021 (based on an aggregation of the Group’s International Revenue and FirstPort’s revenues without pro forma adjustments, each for the year ended December 31, 2021).

We define Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the IFRS-16 impact on leases at our French and international premises and includes IAS 17 adjustments for leasing for vehicles, copy machines and laptops. We adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. We present Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA as additional information because we believe it is helpful to investors in evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However, Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. (2) Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Margin and EBITDA Margin is calculated as Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA and EBITDA, respectively, divided by revenue for the relevant period. (3) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures. We define EBITDA as net profit before Income tax expense, share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies, other financial income and expenses, net income from cash and cash equivalents, cost of gross debt, non-recurring operating income (expenses) and elimination of net additions to depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as adjusted for completed acquisitions, minority interest and COVID-19 impact. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as additional information because we believe they are helpful to investors in highlighting trends and evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However, other companies may present EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and therefore comparability may be limited. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net profit as an indicator of our operating performance, profitability, liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the target for the next 12 months, without double counting the results already included in the relevant period, based on its historical data. The number reflects the estimated impact of the churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model, which are calculated based on the historical churn and cost savings we have achieved with prior acquisitions. These figures are diligenced in connection with each acquisition and validated by our operational and regional teams who will integrate the target as part of their perimeter and track the performance against budgeted figures. Most of the acquisitions are integrated within three to six months and are then part of the organic perimeter of the Group. The types of synergies that are recognized in the first year following an acquisition, many of which are recognized on day one, typically include target management costs if they do not stay with the business, staff costs related to functions such as headquarters and accounting, advertising costs, non-recurring items such as recruitments fees and subcontracting, and accounting adjustments such as for taxes and leases, which we record below EBITDA.

While our Joint Property Management and Lease Management businesses have been relatively resilient as our employees were able to service customers from a remote working environment; they did experience a slight fall in revenues due to impacts such as a reduction in transfer fees in Joint Property Management and disruptions with the postal service, which led to delays in sending invoices and receiving fees in Lease Management. We also experienced some offsetting effects such as government programs to supplement salaries for employees who were unable to work as well as a decrease in headquarter costs and performance bonuses.

We have not adjusted our EBITDA for the impact of ----- the Brokerage and Lettings business lines, which are our primarily non-recurring flow businesses. Our Brokerage business line was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first lockdown from March to May 2020. During this time, we were not able to recognize revenue due to the cessation of notary services, and the closure of our agencies and the limited ability for people to move led to a reduction in new transactions. As a result of the restrictions imposed during the second lockdown in France lasting approximately two months from October 30, 2020 (the “second lockdown”), the number of new transactions was impacted, but not as significantly, and notaries were allowed to work, which enabled us to recognize revenue during this period. The renting side of our Lease Management and Letting business is a transaction-based business that also experienced a decline in revenue when the French government largely prohibited people from moving to new properties during the initial lockdown and, to a lesser extent, during the second lockdown. Constatimmo, which performs diagnostic and inventory reviews, experienced a similar decrease in revenue as a result of fewer lettings and therefore fewer individuals requiring its services. For a more detailed description of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including the breakdown of lost revenue by business line, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors _affecting results of operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_ The above information and adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. This information has not been audited, reviewed or verified by our statutory auditors in accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards and the resulting financial information, including our Adjusted EBITDA, are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. In particular, the adjustments take into account our estimated lost revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic based on our internal budgets and historic performance. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present _information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_ (4) Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. We define Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA after giving pro forma effect to the estimated impact of acquisitions with signed share purchase agreement expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2023, additional synergies from acquisitions (from 12 months and up to 18 months) and Agency of the Future / Millenium cost savings and efficiency gains. We present Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA as additional information because we believe it is helpful to investors in highlighting trends and evaluating the performance of the underlying business. However, other companies may present Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and therefore comparability may be limited. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions or other transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as nonrecurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net profit as an indicator of our operating performance, profitability, liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

(b) Represents the estimated pro forma EBITDA impact of closed acquisitions during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, including FirstPort, as if such acquisitions had closed at the beginning of the period. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the target for the next twelve months, without double counting the results already included in the relevant period, based on its historical data. The number reflects the impact of estimated churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to each acquired company’s integration in our operational model, which are calculated based on the historical churn and cost savings we have achieved with prior acquisitions. These figures are diligenced in connection with each acquisition and validated by our operational and regional teams who integrate the target as part of their perimeter and track their performance against budgeted figures. Most of the acquisitions are integrated within three to six months and are then part of the organic perimeter of the Group. The types of cost synergies that are recognized in the first year following an acquisition, many of which are recognized on day ----- one, typically include target management costs if they do not stay with the business, staff costs related to functions such as headquarters and accounting, advertising costs, non-recurring items such as recruitment fees and subcontracting and accounting adjustments such as taxes and leases, which we record below EBITDA. (c) Represents the last twelve-month impact from COVID-19 on the EBITDA of our stock (recurring) business lines. See corresponding line item in footnote 3 above for further detail. (d) Represents the pro forma impact of potential acquisitions where we have signed share purchase agreements and expect to close by the end of the first quarter of 2023 (collectively, the “Signed Acquisitions”), as if such acquisitions had closed at the beginning of the period. This adjustment corresponds to the estimated EBITDA of the acquisition for the full year based on its historical data and includes the impact of the estimated churn and the full-year impact of the cost synergies linked to the integration in our operational model. These figures are calculated on the same basis as described in footnote (3)(a) above. (e) Represents additional further synergies and churn from acquisitions (including in respect of Signed Acquisitions) in the 12 months up to 18 months after the closing date, in addition to those already considered in pro forma EBITDA figures in the first 12 months. These synergies include cost synergies related to employee costs, rents, Millenium gains and other costs such as accounting, insurance, IT maintenance and legal costs, travel expenses and bank fees and revenue synergies related to, for example, insurance implementation, the GLI guarantee and cross-selling opportunities between our different divisions. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us relating to each individual acquisition and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates. (f) Represents the estimated gains from efficiencies from the Agency of the Future and our brokerage management initiatives to increase sales leads coming from our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Letting portfolios in the next 24 months, following the deployment of our new ERP system, Millenium. We have designed a new organizational model named Agency of the Future, which was implemented following the roll-out of Millenium in France in 2022. As a result, we estimate gains, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees, an increase in productivity and reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitalization and automation of certain tasks previously done manually (such as collection of reminder fees or postal charges). We have quantified the impact of the plan by (i) identifying potential for productivity improvement, such as analyzing time spent by employees for their principal tasks in a select number of agencies and identifying potential for improved processes after implementing these projects, (ii) reinvesting and improving service quality by, for example, defining a goal for the joint property management and lease management business and the principal tasks of managers and assistants and quantifying the reinvestment necessary in specific roles in order to put this target organization in place and (iii) scaling of the network resulting from the options for improvement of processes and required reinvestment. Our savings estimate was updated to take into account initial field observations from the roll-out of Millenium for estimate target times and savings to be expected on each process with the implementation of Millenium and the Agency of the Future. Initial observations in branches using Millenium have confirmed our savings estimates on finalized processes. Following these confirmations, we modelled a productivity gains ramp-up to take into account the roadmap for the delivery of Millenium features. Consequently, the presented adjustment of €25.0 million reflects an update of our initial assessment of an adjustment of €15.0 million which was calculated per the developments up to the second quarter of 2022, plus the latest developments measured on the basis of five Millenium pilots operating since July 2022 as well as our projection of the Millenium roll-out between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures in connection with Millenium and Agency of the Future were €18.7 million, consisting of €15.4 million for the development and €3.4 million for the deployment of Millenium. We anticipate capital expenditures of €39.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, consisting of €12.7 million for the development and €3.1 million for the deployment of Millenium. In the next 18 to 24 months, we estimate approximately €5.6 million of revenue gains as a result of efficiencies due to Millenium and Agency of the Future. We believe that, we will experience additional gains in the following years, as a result of these projects. For more information, see “Business—Digital _Transformation and IT Systems.” The above information and adjustments are based upon available information and_ assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. This information has not been audited. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve for operational efficiency could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected. For more information see, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Any failure by us to _successfully execute on our strategy to achieve for operational efficiency could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.”_ (g) In evaluating Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, as an analytical tool, it is subject to certain limitations. In particular, run-rate cost savings and synergies are unaudited and based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forward looking in nature. We may not be able to achieve these cost savings and synergies in a timely manner or at all. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, including a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates of cost savings and synergies. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the periods presented and may not be comparable with our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these items proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our cost-saving measures. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated at the beginning of the period. The EBITDA of each of the relevant acquired companies may not be representative of what the EBITDA of such entities would have been for the period, as the case may be, had the acquisitions for which an adjustment is made occurred and been fully integrated at the beginning of the period. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA_ ----- _Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and the related lockdown measures, in particular its effects in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK where we have material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had in the past, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on our business.”_ (5) Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, divided by Adjusted Revenue and Pro Forma M&A Adjusted Revenue, respectively, for the relevant period.

A change of control will not be ----- deemed to have occurred on one occasion if, pro forma for such change of control, certain consolidated total net leverage ratios calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” are not exceeded as a result of such event. See “Description of _the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control.”_ Tender Offers .......................................................** In connection with certain tender offers for the Senior Secured Notes for any series, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Senior Secured Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of such Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured _Notes—Optional Redemption.”_ Certain Covenants ...............................................** The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain investments; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - consolidate or merge with other entities; - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes; and - amend certain documents. ----- Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the _Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.”_ Original Issue Discount .......................................** The Additional Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the stated principal amount of the Additional Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, in which case in addition to the stated interest on the Additional Notes, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to include the OID in gross income (as ordinary income), on a constant yield to maturity basis, in advance of the receipt of the cash payment thereof and regardless of such holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because the terms and conditions of the Additional Notes are not identical to the terms and conditions of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Additional Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes and will have separate ISINs and common codes from the ISINs and common codes assigned to the Existing Senior Secured Notes. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States _Federal Income Tax Consequences.”_ Transfer Restrictions ...........................................** The Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity pressure, fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent declines in property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we serve.","Demand for our residential and commercial real estate services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity and economic conditions in the countries, regions and sectors in which we operate. Periods of economic weakness or recession, rising interest rates, fiscal or political uncertainty, market volatility, declining employment levels, declining demand for residential or commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of our business. In addition, any of these events may have a direct impact on our ability to collect payments that we are owed under our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés”) and occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”), which we offer to certain residential landlords and lessors, respectively. See “—Low _demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_ The outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact on global economic conditions. Such conditions have resulted in shortages in materials and services and have led to increased inflationary pressure in 2022, including increases in the price for goods and services, including energy prices. Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine and currently the conflict has not had any material impact on our overall revenue and EBITDA, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential impact of the increasing tensions and other geopolitical conflicts could have on our operations. Continuing increases in inflation could also impact the rate of rent payment default in the properties we service or the overall demand for and costs of our services and the margins we are able to realize on our services. For example, we estimate that the negative impact from elevated levels of inflation on EBITDA for our French business in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was approximately €2.5 million. Additionally, inflationary pressures in the labor markets in which we have operations could cause our personnel costs, which represented 51.4% of our revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, excluding employees in our headquarters, to increase. Although we anticipate that in 2023, our personnel costs should be moderately higher in France and in other countries, we expect that the impact of such increase may be partially offset due to price increases in our stock businesses, which are contractually guaranteed in France and negotiable in other countries. We also expect to benefit from the impact of higher interest rates on some of our clients’ bank deposits as a result of the continuing interest raises, and from inflationary price increases built into our management fees in the UK. However, governments may also cap increases in rent, such as France’s recent decision ----- in August 2022 to cap increases in rent by 3.5%, which may limit our ability to pass through inflationary pressures to our customers. Policy responses to inflation, such as increases to central bank policy rates in respect of the currencies with which we conduct our operations or in which our outstanding debt is denominated, may also impact our business, for example, by causing credit conditions to tighten (and adversely affecting the real estate markets in which we operate) or by increasing the costs of our debt service obligations, to the extent we have outstanding debt with a floating rate of interest. See “—Risks Relating to our Capital Structure— _The Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.” These inflationary pressures, individually and in_ combination, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a limited impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations are also significantly impacted by economic trends, government policies and the real estate markets in the countries in which we operate. These include the following: overall economic activity, changes in interest rates, the impact of tax and regulatory policies, the cost and availability of credit and the geopolitical environment. The performance of our RRES services depends on our ability to collect fixed fees, charge variable fees for ancillary services, find tenants to bill transaction fees and collect rents. Our Joint Property Management business model is composed of fixed fees and variable fees related to additional services that could decline due to adverse economic conditions or administrative restrictions such as pandemic lockdowns. Additionally, the revenue derived from the Lease Management side of our Lease Management and Letting business is generally based on a percentage of rent collections from the properties we manage and, with respect to the renting side of the Lease Management and Letting business, from the one-off fees we receive for each new lease agreement entered into by our customers. The revenue generated by our business can be affected by many factors, including: (i) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions; (ii) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and regionally; (iii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; (iv) the impact of inflationary pressures and cost of living on our tenants, which could contribute to increasing defaults or could cause tenants to trade down to lower rents; and (v) a decrease in the rate of tenants moving and a corresponding decrease in the one-off fees we receive for new lease agreements entered into by our customers. If tenants are unable to pay their rents, we are unable to collect the fees that are typically directly deducted from these rental payments. Additionally, if the cost of our services increases, customers may switch to other, lower-cost real estate services providers. Adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also impact our Brokerage business as it may lead to a decline in property sales and/or a reduction in sales prices, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in brokering such transactions. Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty, as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets, business environment and the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our future financial performance. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Macroeconomic and market conditions.”_ The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which occurred on January 31, 2020 following a national referendum in June 2016 (“Brexit”), has created lingering uncertainty about the future relationship among the UK, one of our current markets, and the EU and its remaining member states and may constitute an additional risk for the financial markets and the European economy. While the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement, which came into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, Brexit has led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the borders of the UK and the EU as well as a lack of haulage and other qualified supply chain and logistics workers, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the UK. As a result, Brexit may affect our level of revenues and EBITDA in the United Kingdom, particularly with ----- respect to the FirstPort business. Moreover, fluctuations in the exchange rates used to convert the financial statements of FirstPort denominated in a British pound sterling as part of the consolidation process might significantly affect results of operations, net financial debt, and consolidated net assets in the financial statements. See also “—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Fluctuations in _exchange rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations.” Given the lack of_ comparable precedent, it is unclear what long-term financial, trade and legal implications Brexit will have and whether, and to what extent, our business could be affected. In addition, certain political parties in Scotland are currently pushing for a second referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, which may lead to additional uncertainty and may affect our business activities in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom. Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"The COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and the related lockdown measures, in particular its effects in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK where we have material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had in the past, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on our business.","The COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variants such as Delta and Omicron and related sub-variants, and the rapidly evolving reactions of authorities, including those in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK, to contain the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce generally, including disruptions to supply chain, workforce, transactional activity, facility operation and production. While restrictions on the conduct of business in many jurisdictions, including the closure of workplaces determined to be non-essential, have eased or been lifted, there remain certain restrictions on the international, national and local movement of people and goods, which continue to disrupt many of our clients’ business operations and their recruitment needs. The extent and scope of such restrictions continue to be highly uncertain and subject to change, and stricter measures could potentially be put in place in the future. A prolonged continuance of this public health crisis could therefore have a material adverse effect, including materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global, European, French, UK, Belgian, German, Dutch, Swiss and Luxembourgish macroeconomic outlooks. Although there was no meaningful impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we cannot predict the impact that any future developments relating to it may have on our business. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of COVID-19, its severity, emergence of new variants and further actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the rate of deployment of vaccines. A number of measures taken by governments in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic intended to mitigate the spread of COVID19 caused significant effects on our business, including decreased demand for our services as a result of the slowdown in the European economies in which we operate and our inability to offer certain services as a result of government lockdown measures. In accordance with the decisions taken by most European governments in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public during the lockdown periods in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK in the spring of 2020 (the “first lockdown”), as well as to employees (barring exceptional cases). During that period, real estate agents were barred from traveling to sign mandates or show properties and notaries were closed, which prevented any brokerage transactions from closing. For further discussion on notary execution, see “Regulation—France— _Hoguet.” Moving into new premises during this period was particularly complicated, as only moves_ that could not be postponed could be carried out, which resulted in reduced letting fees for the period. The first lockdown measures imposed on the French, Swiss, German and Belgian population also negatively impacted our fee collection with an increasing number of residential and commercial tenants not being able to pay their rent on time or at all, although the rents remained owed as a matter of law. The lease management market was also affected as we collect a portion of rents via check, and there were disruptions with postal service, which led to delays in sending and receiving invoices and fees. ----- Softer lockdowns were introduced again in the autumn of 2020 and spring 2021 which also led to the closure of all of our branches to the public in France which adversely impacted our ability to deliver our services. In addition, the lockdowns and related restrictions caused us to pause for a short period of time the roll-out of Millenium, our new ERP system, in 2020. However, we were able to subsequently resume the roll-out, which is now proceeding according to schedule. For further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our various businesses, see “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Although we are the global leading provider of residential real estate services, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies and businesses. Depending on the geography, property type or business, we face competition from other residential or commercial real estate services providers and investment firms, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms and consulting firms. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or business than we have allocated to that geography, property type or business. In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors or further consolidation of the industry. For example, increased regulation following the implementation of the 2014 French access to housing and urban renovation law, l’accès au logement et un urbanisme rénové (“ALUR law”), and the increasing need to invest in the digitization of services has led to the increased consolidation of a highly fragmented market. For further discussion on the ALUR law, see “Regulation—France—ALUR.” Reaching critical scale is important for the digitization and industrialization of processes in order to reduce costs and improve customer service. Our industry is highly fragmented among regional, local and boutique providers. Although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger or have a stronger presence on a local or regional basis or in their primary markets. We are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar services to our commercial real estate business, and it is possible that further consolidation in the residential and commercial real estate industry could lead to much larger competitors in the geographies, property types and businesses that we serve. In addition, disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to effectively compete. Further, we also face competition from service providers, who may have greater knowledge of their home markets, a better understanding of the specificities of regulations and local legislation and established reputations in their region. There is no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete, maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Moreover, our customers’ tenants could experience a change in their financial situation at any time, including as a result of global economic events, natural disasters and public health or pandemic crises. Our customers’ tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments ----- when due, or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases, or expiration of existing leases without renewal, and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated or expired leases. Although a significant portion of our revenues are derived from “stock” businesses consisting of providing fee-based services to our customer portfolio, the loss of income by our customers could hinder their ability to pay such fees. Moreover, while our fees for our Joint Property Management business are expected to be paid by the landlords whether or not the property is being rented or occupied by the landlord, for our Lease Management and Letting business, our fees are paid only if the properties are being rented and paid for by the tenants. Therefore, lease terminations may result in a decrease in fees that we receive. Additionally, even if the lease continues, but the tenant fails to pay rent, we will not be able to collect our fees because they are automatically deducted from rental payments. We also are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in the winter so the effect of non-payment may be greater during that time because we will not be able to evict and re-let the property as quickly as during other times in the year. See “Regulation.” In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights and may incur substantial costs in protecting our customers and re-letting their property. If commercial leases are terminated or defaulted upon, it may be difficult to find a tenant to whom the property can be re-let. We also offer a rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés”) to certain residential landlords who have entrusted us with the management of their property. Under this guarantee, we bear the cost of any unpaid rent and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and thus represent a risk of non-recovery. We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”) to a small number of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected apartments in new buildings. As a result, we may bear the cost of any unoccupied properties under this guarantee. For example, the quantity of unpaid rent typically increases during the winter months when we are prohibited from evicting people under French law, and thus it is possible that we may experience an increase in loss of revenues if we are unable to rent such properties. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, our stock increased temporarily as it built up when we were unable to process disputes and evictions as a result of the first lockdown restrictions. In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant increase in unpaid rent or defaults, however, we cannot ensure that our revenues will not be negatively impacted as a result of future lockdowns or other COVID-19-related disruptions. There is no assurance that we will receive payments that we are owed under our rent payment and occupancy guarantees; therefore, both represent a large source of potential risk. Moreover, the occurrence of any of the situations described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For information about our guarantee programs, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key _Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Rent payment and occupancy guarantees” and “Business— Our Businesses—French Residential Real Estate Services—Lease Management and Letting.”_",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The growth and the strength of the UK housing market is closely linked to macroeconomic conditions in the UK, which are affected by macroeconomic conditions in Europe and worldwide. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, global GDP is estimated to have decreased by 2.8% in 2021, with UK GDP declining by 4.0% in the same year. Moreover, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact on the UK economy, which is predicted by the IMF to grow more slowly than economies of other developed countries in the near future. Recently, a deterioration in economic conditions in the UK coupled with internal political instability resulted in an increased volatility of the UK mortgage markets, which, in turn, negatively ----- affected the UK real estate sector and contributed to declining real estate valuations in certain areas of the country. Any future deterioration in economic conditions in the UK could lead to increased unemployment rates, loss of earnings, increased short and long-term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, inflation, increased cost of living, shortages of labor and/or materials and supplies and increased energy prices.

We routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets, and in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we completed 55 acquisitions. We plan to continue to expand our business externally through similar acquisitions depending in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient funds from our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, existing debt facilities and additional indebtedness to fund these acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we pursue largely depends on the quality of the potential target and a key point of focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary reason we decline to pursue a target after entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of the target’s client accounting. The success of our acquisition strategy depends on the ability of our senior management to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of such acquisition candidates, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals from regulatory bodies and to integrate the operations of such businesses once they are acquired. Our success in making additional acquisitions depends on the availability of, and competition for, suitable acquisition candidates. Further, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including any misjudgment of the key elements of an acquisition, quality of client accounting, competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, lack of internal resources to actively pursue all attractive opportunities and availability of capital. Even after entering into a share purchase agreement, exclusivity agreement or letter of intent, there can be no assurance that such acquisition will close until such transactions are finalized, which may also impact the Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum.

We have historically financed acquisitions through a variety of sources, including our own cash reserves and debt financing. While we intend to continue to finance acquisitions from these sources in the future, we may have insufficient cash reserves to fund acquisitions, and adverse market conditions or other factors may prevent us from obtaining debt finance on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to ----- implement our acquisition strategy, obtain sufficient financing or integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business and prospects for growth could be negatively affected. See “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Disposals.”_ Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful implementation of our acquisition strategies. Additionally, our strategies may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment or this may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future acquisitions or we may face unforeseen costs or liabilities. In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and bolt-on acquisitions, and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. Our ability to realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisition activities, including any anticipated cost synergies and other anticipated benefits, will depend in large part upon whether we are able to integrate such businesses efficiently and effectively. Integration is an ongoing process, and we may not be able to fully integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. Successful integration of acquired businesses will also depend on our ability to effect any required changes in operations or personnel and may require capital expenditures or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. The integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including the following: liability related to the mishandling of customer cash accounts; difficulty in integrating the acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, including the full integration of the acquired business account management into our IT system, management information and financial control systems; unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions; significant unexpected liabilities or contingencies arising from the acquisitions; potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by our senior management’s focus on the acquired companies; and post-acquisition performance not meeting our expectations or plans. We are required to have separate customer accounts in our Joint Property Management business, and if a target has poor customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances or complying with applicable law. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions will be made on appropriate terms or at an acceptable cost or can be successfully integrated with the rest of our businesses. A failure to identify appropriate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies of past or future acquisitions could result in the lack of implementation and achievement of our growth strategy may prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both landlords and tenants in residential real estate lease transactions or our Brokerage business could have inside information about a property or the property owner’s circumstances relative to other brokers as a result of our managing that property through our RRES business. In certain cases, we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our customers. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to monitor, address and limit actual or perceived conflicts, such as an officer in charge of our risk ----- management team, anti-bribery software, a whistleblower hotline and data compliance procedures, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate or may not be adhered to by our employees. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing customers or fail to gain new customers if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions, regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets. We cannot guarantee that future conflicts of interest will not cause material harm to us.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

In addition, following the acquisition of FirstPort in August 2022, as of September 30, 2022, we managed approximately 321,000 units in the UK under our Joint Property Management business. It may be difficult for us or our agents (including real estate brokers and subcontractors hired by other third parties we engage) to regularly inspect such properties and manage the maintenance and upkeep on behalf of our customers and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may find it difficult to manage tenants if they encounter difficulties with the properties they rent. For example, although there are certain basic necessities that must function properly, such as heat or water, we cannot force a landlord to comply with all tenant requests if they are not mandated by law. Therefore, a tenant may have an unfavorable view of us as property manager for unresolved requests that the landlord will not approve or if they are unhappy with the quality of work commissioned by the landlord, which can present a risk to our reputation. The occurrence of any such development could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to perform the property management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, engaging the appropriate subcontractors, maintaining sufficient personnel and retaining key personnel at the number of our properties that we manage under our Lease Management and Letting and Joint Property Management businesses. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, in integrating any new personnel into our organization or in engaging with the appropriate subcontractors at reasonable costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality and maintain other necessary internal controls.

Any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize from these bolt-on acquisitions may differ materially from our estimates. The estimates contained herein are our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. ----- Our ability to realize the expected cost savings, gains and synergies associated with the adjustments included when calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other non–IFRS financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or industry conditions. We may be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies, and these costs are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies will not be higher than we anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings, gains and synergies within 12 months of the completion of the respective acquisitions, and may not do so at all. Further, our churn rate in respect of the bolt-on acquisitions may be higher than expected. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment in our Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings or gains. Our ability to realize these anticipated gains and synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. In addition, any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take. For example, reducing sales, marketing and customer support could result in lower revenue and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in employee productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships. Further, no third party, including our independent auditors or any of the initial purchasers, has performed any assurance procedures or expressed an opinion with respect to these estimated cost savings or gains, or their respective achievability.

Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA and other metrics calculated using Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA include estimated results of acquired businesses assuming such acquisitions were made at the beginning of the period presented. We calculated such figures using third-party quality of earnings assessments and the information and records available from the acquired businesses, which in certain instances was based on unaudited financial information or management schedules and therefore required significant assumptions and estimates, may not be up to date or may not be prepared on the same basis on which we prepare our accounts. While these figures are based upon the latest available financial information from the acquired business at the time we built each business case, actual figures may differ.

For example, we entered the UK market in August, 2022, and we have continued to expand in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and other countries in recent years. Expanding into these geographies involves significant expenditures, over a period of several years, hiring and training of personnel, and marketing efforts to introduce our brand to the new geography. We may not accurately predict such costs or accurately anticipate operational difficulties caused by local conditions, and therefore may not achieve our financial and strategic objectives for our operations in the new geographies. Additionally, any such operational difficulties may impact our customer service, which may lead to customers switching to competitors, or lead to logistical difficulties such as with the processing of invoices and billing. Accordingly, we may incur losses as we expand our operations. Some examples of the risks encountered in entering new regions include: - increased investment associated with understanding new geographies and following trends in these areas in order to effectively compete; - increased costs associated with adapting our products and services to different requirements in the local markets areas, which may decrease our margins and profitability; - challenges relating to developing and maintaining appropriate understanding and complying with new regulatory schemes; - reduced ability to predict our performance because we will have less experience in the new geographies than in our existing geographies; and - political, regulatory and other local risks.

Our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, management, workplace culture, financial condition, our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including the personal conduct of individuals associated with our brand, the handling of customer complaints, regulatory compliance, such as compliance with anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, the use and protection of customer and other sensitive information, and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand. Our portfolio of brands and our reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside of our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to third-party providers, landlords or property owners may be attributed to us, thus damaging our reputation and the value of the affected brand and increasing the attractiveness of our competitors’ services. Also, business decisions or other actions or omissions of our shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investments, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation ----- and brands. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. The protection of our brand, including related trademarks, may require the expenditure of significant financial and operational resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our portfolio of brands may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks. Even when we detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks, we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks. Any unauthorized use by third parties of any of our brands may adversely affect our brands.

If we are unable to effectively execute and maintain our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired. In addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies. For example, we are in the process of rolling out Millenium, our new ERP system designed to digitize many of our services and lead to operational improvements. Implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets, and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules. If we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes, or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, the execution of our business plans may be disrupted. Similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business. Our payroll and compensation technology systems are important to ensuring that key personnel are compensated accurately and on a timely basis. Failure to pay professionals the compensation they are due in a timely manner could result in higher attrition. Failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

As part of this framework, we have adopted several initiatives, including the implementation of our operational models such as “Agency of the Future” and Millenium, our new ERP system which we continuously develop, workflow processes and systems to improve client engagement and outcomes across our service lines. Although we have already successfully begun the rollout of Millenium in our French brokerage and more recently our RRES operations, there is no guarantee that our rollout will continue to be successful from an operational perspective, particular as we aim to accelerate adoption in our operations in the near future. Additionally, our ability to continue to achieve the anticipated cost savings, gains and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with implementing changes to our tools, processes and systems given our varied service lines, the geographic regions in which we and our customers operate and the number of acquisitions that we have completed in recent years. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, we may not achieve or continue to achieve new operational efficiencies and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

If we are unable to find and maintain reliable service providers, any failure by these third parties to adequately perform certain services for us or the loss of these relationships could materially impair our business operations, and reduce our cash flow, income and profitability. For example, the halting of notary activities in connection with the first lockdown directly affected our brokerage activities. While our contracts with certain third parties may provide for indemnification to cover damages resulting from failure to perform their obligations satisfactorily, such indemnification may not fully cover our financial losses in attempting to mitigate their failures or our losses to other parties or may not be received in a timely manner or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

We depend on our business relationships and our reputation to attract and retain customers. As a result, allegations against us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of such allegations, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects, in addition to any financial impact. As a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial and residential real estate services, we, and our licensed professionals and independent contractors, are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us, our sales professionals or independent contractors to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we brokered or managed in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject from time to time to claims by participants in real estate sales and leasing transactions, including associations representing tenants and tenant lobby groups, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, who claim that we did not fulfill our obligations, or by customers for whom we provided appraisal and valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as having been negatively affected by our appraisals and/or valuations. Additionally, we may be subject to billing-related claims in respect of our RRES business, for example that we have over-billed clients or that we have not been sufficiently transparent in our billing. These consumer organizations representing tenants are able to organize class actions in the real estate services market, which has been introduced by the French Hamon law, and file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. We could be subject to claims following the acquisition of a business or subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities or regulatory agencies if they determine that we are violating licensing laws or failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations. In our residential property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide services for our managed properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our customers may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the customer relationship. We engage with subcontractors to provide a large number of building staff in facilities that we manage, and as a result, we face the risk of potential claims from such staff, such subcontractors. We also face employment-related claims as an employer with respect to our corporate and other employees, for which we would bear ultimate responsibility in the event of an adverse outcome in such ----- matters. We also face claims related to our franchisees, with respect to the termination of our franchise agreements and other claims which may arise related to such agreements. Adverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes and related or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage procured and maintained by us. In addition, we face the risk of claims relating to environmental, health and safety matters relating to properties that we manage. For example, such claims could be based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing product components and could present potential direct or indirect liabilities to the Group. Further, we face the risk of claims of illness or injury relating to premise liability given that we lease, manage and sell properties to our customers. Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance policies we maintain. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims held under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. Any of these events could materially negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Finally, we are also subject, from time to time, to tax audits and challenges from relevant tax authorities. In this respect, two entities of the Group are currently undergoing tax audits run by the French tax authorities in respect of fiscal years 2016 to 2018 and 2016 to 2019, respectively. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in a decrease of our tax losses as well as additional tax liabilities and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure. Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control. With respect to cyberattacks and viruses, these pose growing threats to many companies, and we may be a target of such threats, which could expose us to ----- liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm to our business and financial results. For example, our Swiss operations were temporarily disrupted by a ransomware attack in December 2021, though we were able to fully resume normal operations shortly afterwards. Such threats may also disrupt our operations, for example interrupting our customer service offerings or impeding our ability to invoice our customers. In addition, the operation and maintenance of our systems and networks is, in some cases, dependent on third-party technologies, systems and services providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property or disruption of our ability to provide services to or interact with our customers, contractors and vendors, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We could also face difficulties in bringing the IT systems of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our standard security procedures and protections, which could lead to interruptions or failures of our information systems. Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties. Additionally, we may experience higher than expected capital expenditures related to upgrading our IT systems to deal with unexpected future security risks. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers, our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our business relies heavily on the use of software and residential real estate data, some of which is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. A disruption of our ability to access such software, including an inability to renew such licenses on the same or similar terms, or provide data to our professionals and/or our customers, contractors and vendors or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our in-house employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software, phishing and spear phishing attacks, wire fraud and payment diversion, account and email takeover attacks, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks, including attacks that are not ultimately successful, could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, unauthorized release of ----- confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of our data, and could also substantially damage our reputation. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including ransomware attacks by cybercriminals, and we expect we may experience additional attacks in the future.

We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have developed internally or acquired, such as Millenium, or mobile apps developed as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former in-house employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld. Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights if we are not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.

Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. We may not be covered by insurance in specific instances, such as fire, explosions, natural disasters, water damage and terror attacks. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable, and we may experience major incidents of a nature not covered by insurance. Furthermore, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.","We are subject to numerous European, national and local laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our businesses. Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of valuation services requires us, and our employees, to maintain applicable licenses in certain countries in which we perform these services. If we, and our employees, fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations regarding our licenses, we may be ----- required to pay fines or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended, cancelled or revoked. In addition, the residential real estate industry and residential tenancies in particular remain heavily regulated and closely monitored by consumer watchdog organizations and associations that can organize class actions and file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. The latest major change came in 2014, with the introduction of the ALUR law, under which the French government introduced, among others, measures to protect individuals considering buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. A large amount of extra documentation is now required before the pre-contract (compromis de vente) can be signed, which increases the time between the initial offer and closing. We must comply with law No. 89-462 dated July 6, 1989, which grants residential tenants a statutory right of renewal and caps rents for vacant units and renewed leases at the amount of the last indexed rent paid by the previous tenant and/or of a reference rent determined by the decree. This law also restricts a limited number of landlords a right to recover service charges from tenants and requires residential leases to complete various reports on the environmental status of the property or technical features of the premises. In addition, we are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in winter, from November 1 to March 31 each year. We must also comply with articles L.145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, recently modified by law No. 2014-626 dated June 18, 2014 known as the Pinel Law, for premises leased to commercial tenants. The French commercial leases regime establishes various compulsory obligations establishing, amongst others, a minimum term of nine years, a tenant’s statutory right of renewal on lease expiry, a cap on renewed rents and a limitation on service charge recoverable from tenants. We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental, employment laws, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, and occupational health and safety regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters. As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past decade, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future. New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or customers. For example, on May 25, 2018, GDPR became effective with a greater territorial reach than existing laws, and it applies to all of our contracts and agreements throughout Europe. As a result, we updated and continue to update certain agreements and data protection practices, which may take significant time and cost. We are unable to predict how new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. ----- Our tax returns and the tax treatment of our transactions are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties, and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief, withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. In this respect, an increase in administrative efforts within our business and an impact on existing structures may occur from the current incorporation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit-shifting (“BEPS”) that were included in the final reports released by the OECD and the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017. The European Union intends to harmonize tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions) from January 1, 2020. Among the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules apply from January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 in the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”). See “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on these rules._ Furthermore, Article 108 of the 2019 French Finance Law introduced, under French tax law, the antiabuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax and aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions (codified under article 205 A of the French Tax Code). Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement or a series of arrangements which are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, having been put into place for the main purpose, or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law. The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016 including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. In a communication to the European Parliament and the Council of May 18, 2021 and denominated “Business Taxation for the 21st Century”, the European Commission announced additional measures in the field of corporate taxation to take into account the evolution of the context of the EU business taxation policy. In particular, the European Commission announced that it will ----- propose a new framework for income taxation for businesses in Europe (“Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) that will replace the pending proposals under the CCCTB. BEFIT will be a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU and will consist in consolidating the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to member states using a formula and be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the member states and the European Parliament. The European Commission has launched a public consultation on BEFIT on 17 October 2022 opened to all stakeholders until early 2023. The European Commission also published (i) a proposal for a directive setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes on December 22, 2021 (“ATAD 3”) and (ii) a proposal for a directive creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”) aiming at encouraging companies to finance their investment through equity contributions rather than through debt financing. The discussions on these two proposals are still ongoing at the European Union level and therefore the timing for implementation of their provisions at the level of EU member states initially proposed by the European Commission may be postponed. On October 8, 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the Inclusive Framework) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the 140 Inclusive Framework members. The Two-Pillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar Two. Pillar One aims at ensuring a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located. Pillar One is however only intended to apply to MNEs with global revenues exceeding €20 billion and a profitability (defined as profit before tax divided by revenue) greater than 10%, subject to certain adjustments and exclusions applicable to MNEs from specific sectors (mostly extractive sectors and regulated financial services), which should only include about a hundred MNEs under the latest assessment of the OECD. Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the GloBE rules). On December 20, 2021, the OECD published the pillar two model rules (the “Model Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October 2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE rules into domestic legislation. They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii) determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the top-up tax. On December 22, 2021, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a Directive setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups. The draft Directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 member states the Model Rules that include an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the European Union fundamental freedoms. In practice, if the Company is regarded as part of an MNE group which has consolidated revenues of more than EUR 750,000,000 in at least two out of the previous four years, it may be within the scope of the GloBE Rules. In addition, the draft Directive makes use of an option contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby the member state of a lowtaxed income entity (referred as constituent entity) applying the IIR is required to ensure effective taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities residents in that member State. The Directive was adopted by the EU member states on 15 December 2022 and they will have until 31 December 2023 to transpose the Directive into national legislation, noting that the IIR should be applicable in EU member states for fiscal years starting on or after 31 ----- December 2023 and the UTPR should apply to fiscal years starting on or after 31 December 2024. Furthermore, additional rules on tax dispute resolution apply since January 1, 2019 following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the 2019 French Finance Law. The Group is monitoring these different regulations as they develop and are implemented into applicable law, as they could impact our tax position in the future. Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Group’s companies are located, or operate, or may be located, or may operate, may not always provide clear-cut or definitive guidelines, the tax regime applied to the Group’s operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations (past or future) is or may sometimes be based on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s interpretations of French or foreign tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which the Group’s companies are located or operate may result in reassessments, late payment interests, fines and penalties.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Labor laws applicable to our business in certain countries, particularly France, are relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. Relatedly, we may face disputes from contractors seeking to be recognized as employees under applicable labor laws. In addition, some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business. Although we believe our relations with employees are good, our operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work-slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our employees in certain countries benefit from collective bargaining agreements, ----- and we may not be able to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. In particular, higher rates of inflation may cause employees to demand increased salaries, which could either result in higher personnel costs or actual or threatened strikes, work stoppages, or related actions. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in Switzerland, we participate in employer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants.

Any changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results from operations. In particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB. Notably, in May 2021, the IASB endorsed the conclusions of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (the “IFRS IC”) dated December 2020 regarding the basis for calculating the period of service to which an entity attributes benefit for a particular defined benefit plan. According to these conclusions, entities should consider periods of benefit entitlement and caps on those periods when recognizing benefit obligations. Whereas the approach most commonly used in France was to recognize benefit obligations on a straight-line basis from the date the employee in question joined the entity to the date of their retirement, the IFRS IC considers that benefit obligations should only be recognized on a straight-line basis over the number of years of employee service immediately before the retirement age, and that said years of service should be capped. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations— Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—2020 Restatement.”_ In addition, in April 2021, the IASB endorsed the conclusions of the IFRS IC dated March 2021 regarding the accounting for configuration or customization costs of a supplier’s application software in a SaaS arrangement. The decision of the IFRS IC confirmed that in most cases, in accordance with IAS 38, such costs shall be recognized as an expense rather than intangible assets since, on the one hand, the customer does not control the software and, on the other hand, the configuration or customization does not generate a resource controlled by the customer that is distinct from the software.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries, and on the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Additional Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases, may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limit the ability to upstream cash to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer subject to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law, as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group, may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. The subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that do not guarantee the Additional Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Additional Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limits the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

See “Description of the _Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our_ ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. ----- In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while amounts under the Senior Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio, while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Some reforms are already effective including the Benchmark Regulations and the cessation of the publication of the sterling LIBOR benchmark and certain tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark after December 31, 2021, while others are still to be implemented. In particular, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark after June 30, 2023. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. These reforms and recommendations may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Credit Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. ----- It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, the various benchmarks will continue to be supported going forward. This may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported benchmarks, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, including as a result of changing macro-economic conditions, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow and hindering our ability to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes (including the Additional Notes) and the Senior Notes. None of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Indenture contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we have entered into and maintain, hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, notably two new interest rate hedging arrangements amounting to €573.75 million each set up by the Group by purchasing two new 1% strike CAP against 3-month EURIBOR (December 2024 maturity), there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Prior to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case, acting through their respective creditor representatives).

The share pledges over financial securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a financial securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured creditor, either by a sale of the pledged financial securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or _pacte commissoire) of the financial securities to the secured creditor, following which the secured_ creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged financial securities. In a proceeding for attribution _judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an expert is appointed (whether contractually or by the court)_ to value the collateral (in this case, the pledged financial securities), and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the financial securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire _or an attribution conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value_ of the foreclosed financial securities.

If the value of such financial securities is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such financial securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured. If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) declines to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the financial securities, a sale of the pledged financial securities could be undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions set forth in the immediately following risk factor, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged financial securities through a public auction.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be ----- less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged, because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Additional Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Additional Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security Agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq of the French Civil Code has the right to enforce such security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Additional Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the ----- Additional Notes, except through the Trustee, who will provide instructions (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the Security Agent. The security over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be granted in favor of the Security Agent as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations (“Parallel Debt”) created to satisfy a requirement that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Guarantor. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, including any additional Notes (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the full principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. The holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security, except through the Security Agent. Holders of Additional Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as a beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, which is governed by English law. There can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective before French courts since there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted as the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be invalid or unenforceable with respect to the claims of any person who is not a party to the relevant security document, including all holders of the Senior Secured Notes. To the extent that the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral created under the parallel debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Additional Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of France and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest,” as defined in the Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of France and pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan receivables and bank accounts held by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries and third-party Senior Secured Notes Collateral providers (as applicable) incorporated under the laws of France. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ or any other of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Additional Notes against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the enforceability of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances, the court may also void the Security Interest or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such Guarantor; ----- - direct that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes return any amounts paid under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Additional Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents (as defined herein) will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Senior Secured Notes and _the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor: - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the Guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis and: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. ----- Although we believe we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Senior Secured Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and the enforcement of each such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will dilute the value of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Additional Notes. Accordingly, enforcement of any such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in relation to, indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that the recipient return the payment or any proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the Guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by- case basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the Guarantor or security provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured ----- are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. In addition, each of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any other document governing the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee or the security provider’s Senior Secured Notes Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or Senior Secured Notes Collateral apply the Additional Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee obligation apply, the Senior Secured Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover, an increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will dilute the value of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.

In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management,” according to which the expenses incurred by a French company, in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible. ----- Under Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) under the control of a same third entity. In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Article 39-1-3 and 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code), nondeductible interest would constitute constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219 I of the French Tax Code (i.e., 25%) for payments benefiting legal persons or (ii) the rate of 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in any case to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty). Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a _pro rata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last 12 months) and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented whereby companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their net equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong can, provided they are not thinly capitalized, deduct net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation up to 75% of their amount. French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s net equity, its net financial expenses are deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s net equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s net equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall ----- indebtedness ratio of the consolidated group to which it belongs, as determined under accounting consolidation rules (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group’s debts (with the exception of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the consolidated group’s net equity), is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its net equity). Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by the French tax group and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-equity ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis at the level of the French tax group perimeter pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in respect of any loans contracted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from any related party) and at the level of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Additional Notes used by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. Pursuant to the _Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts_ BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 bis, I of the French Tax Code under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 bis, VII of the French Tax Code under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Articles 119 et seq. of the French Tax Code and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code. Finally, the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, have been implemented into French law by the French Finance Law for 2020 and have been applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain provisions which have been applicable as from January 1, 2022. Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the socalled “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. ----- In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

We assist our residential and commercial customers at every stage of their property journey with competitive and comprehensive service offerings. We provide end-to-end assistance, from managing individual apartment and building areas jointly owned by apartment owners through our Lease Management and Letting and Joint Property Management business lines, respectively, to providing brokerage, digital and other services such as insurance brokerage, technical diagnostic and energy brokerage through our other business lines. Our RRES business is the leader in France, operating under the Foncia brand through a network of approximately 134 and 131 branches dedicated to our RRES and Brokerage businesses, respectively, and 242 branches dedicated to both our RRES and Brokerage businesses, representing 83.4% of our revenue in France for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, our French RRES business, Brokerage business, Digital services, B2B services and international business generated 57.7%, 13.3%, 9.5%, 4.7% and 14.8% of our total revenue, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

These factors combined with the cyclical nature of the residential property market impact supply and demand, which in turn impact, among other things, residential property prices, Brokerage business commissions and the volume of Brokerage transactions. We believe the diversified nature of our services between recurring and transaction-based activities, our geographic coverage including nationwide presence in France and certain other geographies and the scale of our business have provided some insulation from economic cycles and resiliency to negative market conditions. Nevertheless, recent developments such as central banks’ policies resulting in the tightening of credit conditions, constitute substantial headwinds to the real estate markets in which we operate, which, in turn, may result in adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We classify our revenues as either “stock” (recurring) or “flow” (transaction-tied). Within each business line, there may be stock and flow components based on the various types of revenue streams. Our stock businesses consist of recurring revenues, which by their nature provide better long-term visibility and are less sensitive to the volume of housing transactions and economic cycles. Stock revenue generation is primarily composed of, in both residential and B2B businesses, our Joint Property Management fixed fee, Lease Management fee, including fees on collected rents and insurance broker fees and fees unique to our business such as our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés” or “rent payment guarantee”) which we offered on approximately 65% of our residential dwellings in France for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For more information on our rent payment fees, see “—Rent payment and occupancy guarantees.” Our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Letting businesses are examples of largely stock businesses producing a high share of recurring revenues. Notwithstanding the stability, stock businesses retain some sensitivity to changing economic or market conditions. For example, higher unemployment rates or potential decreases in wages or salaries may affect the average income of tenants or reduce their ability to pay rent and, if tenants do not make rental payments, we are unable to collect our fees which are taken by automatic deduction from rental payments. In addition, if tenants are unable to pay their rent, this could impact the property owner’s (i.e., our customers) ability to pay certain other fees and this non-payment could obligate us to make payments to the property owner under our rent payment guarantees. Where we have offered our rent payment guarantee, we bear the cost if a tenant fails to make a timely rent payment and these advances are not always recoverable. Our business model, however, aims to balance both stock and flow businesses to mitigate the impact of changing market conditions with a stable mix revenue derived from stock and flow businesses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, approximately 60% of our revenue derived from stock businesses. Flow activities are those for which we charge transactional fees that are not automatically recurring, and are thus more dependent on the external factors listed above. Our Brokerage business is an example of a largely flow business where we only receive a fee upon the closure of a transaction and, therefore, it faces greater exposure to economic fluctuations than our stock businesses. Brokerage fees are limited to our real estate sales transactions. Other examples of flow activities include revenue generation ----- composed of, for example, letting fees, _Constatimmo (our technical due diligence and inventories services unit) activities related to brokerage and letting, some Joint Property Management variable fees, such as reminder fees and maintenance and repair commissions on third-party invoices. We generated 85.2% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 in France. Although we operate nationwide in France and therefore benefit from diversification across a range of real estate services markets, we are particularly sensitive to the economic conditions and developments in France as well as potential regulatory changes, economic shocks, or social upheaval, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The real estate services market, particularly in France, is highly fragmented, providing opportunities to add scale, market presence and revenues by acquiring businesses, centralizing costs and operating as part of our diversified portfolio. These acquisitions have been a driver of the growth in our geographic scale, breadth of offerings, revenue and profit margins. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we entered the UK market with the acquisition of FirstPort and we also completed 54 acquisitions in our primary French market and in our other geographies, representing 29,069 new Lease Management dwellings (bringing our total to 376,262) and 553,981 new Joint Property Management dwellings (bringing our total to 1,765,964) and €261.1 million of acquired revenues. Following the acquisition of FirstPort in August 2022, as of September 30, 2022, we managed 321,000 units in the UK under our Joint Property Management business and approximately 3,000 lease management units in lettings in the UK In addition, as part of our overall growth strategy, we proactively manage the composition of our portfolio. We take measures to increase efficiencies and profit and cash flows which include focusing on our RRES business offerings and occasionally disposing of certain assets that are less profitable. For more information on our business lines, see “Business—Overview.” Our results of operations are affected by the number of locations where we provide services and the geographies and market conditions in which those sites are located. As a result, our results for future periods may not be directly comparable to past periods because of the large volume of acquisition activity that we have undertaken.

We bear the cost of any unpaid rent and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. However, due to our diligent selection and recovery processes as described below, we believe these rental guarantees offer an attractive business model and by underwriting these guarantees on our balance sheet, we believe we offer a differentiating and competitive service to customers that smaller players would not be able to deliver. Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts and, while a tenant remains in the property, we account for the related payments as follows: - the rent guarantee related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are deducted from rents in the same way as basic property management fees; and - when a tenant fails to make their rent payment and after they have vacated the property, we record a provision on our balance sheet that is calculated in accordance with IAS 37 to account for the loss. The amount of the provision we set aside increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (“Arrêtés des Comptes _Locataires” or “ACL”) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed_ on a statistical basis and regularly updated). From a cash flow perspective, we pay rent to the landlord when rent is due, regardless of whether rent is received from the tenant, and will take remedial measures ----- to try to recover the payment from the tenant. Once a tenant leaves the property, we record for the direct loss. We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation” or “occupancy guarantee”) to a small number of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected apartments in new buildings. We typically only offer this occupancy guarantee in limited circumstances for highly desirable properties where we believe there is a low risk of loss. The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days. In September 2022, on average, 66% of our residential dwellings in France were covered by the rent payment guarantee and 13% of residential dwellings were covered by the occupancy guarantee. We believe we have a strong ability to assess credit risk when offering these guarantees and we undertake a detailed process to select eligible tenants and dwellings. We refer to the new, unpaid rents as a result of defaults under a guarantee each month as our new monthly aggregate of unpaid rent and the total sum of unpaid rents per month as our cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent. In September 2022, €115.9 million of rent revenues were covered by the rent payment guarantee, for which we experienced €3.6 million new unpaid rent (compared to a 2021 monthly average of new unpaid rent of €3.1 million for €108.7 million covered rent revenues) and the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent was €29.4 million, including outstanding rent payments from previous years. The chart below sets out unpaid rents (in EUR millions) for tenants who remained in their flat versus tenants who moved out of their flat from June 2021 to September 2022, under our rent payment guarantee: We take proactive measures to insulate our business from losses under both the rent payment guarantee and occupancy guarantee including through the stringent credit assessment that we undertake before providing these guarantees and our unpaid rental collection processes. Following an eviction and the transfer of the surrogative discharge from the landlord to us, we have a strong team that seeks to recover the unpaid rent from the defaulting tenant, including by legal means. We have historically recovered approximately 47% of the unpaid rent amount over the last three years, which is added to our statement of profit and loss as revenue. Therefore, given the regulatory regime that restricts when we can evict a tenant and the time it takes to collect unpaid rent, the risk associated with the guarantees has historically been related to the timing of cash flows, rather than lost revenue. However, any unrecoverable payments under these guarantees could result in a significant loss or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and _Industry—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

There was no meaningful impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The general lockdown measures imposed by the governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate continued to disrupt the property market in the spring of 2021. In order to protect our workforce and maintain the continuity of our operations, we implemented preventative measures including allowing employees to work from home, permitting short-term working arrangements and providing exceptional travel certificates to certain employees to carry out minimum duties. These costs were all accounted as non-recurring operating income (expenses) due to their exceptional nature. Partially due to the success of the measures we have implemented, we believe we have been able to manage our operations and employee absenteeism, with minimal disruption. In 2022 we saw a gradual normalization of economic activities in our primary geographic markets, recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels. For purposes of determining our Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we have included €20.8 million and €7.4 million, respectively, that represent the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our stock (recurring) business lines as those are generally more stable and predictable.

We are subject to laws and regulations including those related to rental access and urban planning, rents we can charge, data protection, tax reduction schemes for rental property investors and reforms to housing, planning and digital technology. For example, the French government has introduced measures to protect individuals buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. The Access to Housing and Urban Renovation Law (“ALUR”), which was introduced in March 2014, imposed restrictions on the fees agents can charge for selling or letting property and required two dedicated bank accounts for each jointly owned property, thereby resulting in loss of interest income on customer accounts and a large administrative burden. The ALUR law also required a significant amount of extra documentation before the pre-contract (compromis de vente) can be signed, which increased the time between the initial offer and closing and thereby delaying our revenue recognition. In addition, it required publication of commissions when payable by the buyer and any resulting competition from low cost agents. Notwithstanding these requirements, we have experienced certain positive impacts from the imposition of the ALUR law. For example, it required landlords to register their buildings, which became a new fee-based service we began providing. Changes in, and compliance with, such laws and regulations may entail significant costs for us and can have an impact on our results of operations. For a description of certain material regulations applicable to our business, see “Regulation.” Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, whether identified as a result of an investigation or otherwise, could lead to adverse publicity, harm our reputation or divert management time and other resources. In addition, non-compliance could result in disciplinary action, imposition of fines, the revocation of a license or authorization or the need to take remedial action. In particular, the loss of a license or authorization could mean that we are no longer able to carry out the business or activity for which we were previously authorized or licensed and any remedial action that may need to be undertaken could result in a significant cost. Finally, such laws, rules and regulations may subject us to more onerous conduct of business and administrative requirements, limit the types of fees or services we can charge and provide or otherwise alter the current regulatory or tax environment, each of which can have a significant impact on the manner in which we conduct our businesses. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof.

Our principal costs include staff costs and marketing and IT costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, staff costs accounted for 51.4% of revenue. Our business (excluding brokerage activities) has a largely fixed cost base. Our fixed costs, which do not fluctuate with business volumes, consist primarily of salaries and wages (excluding variable commissions, employee profit shares and bonus arrangements), rental costs, most of our information technology (“IT”) costs, as well as other general costs. The management of our cost base is an important factor impacting our results of operations and cash flow. We are able to initiate cost cutting measures when required, such as using temporary employees and limiting travel, entertainment and office expenses and reducing variable compensation. Our Brokerage business, which is more exposed to real estate services market cycles in which our employees are paid based on commission, operates primarily with variable costs, with approximately 24.9% of fixed costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Of a total of €84.3 million of costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, our Brokerage business incurred €54.4 million of ----- commissions on sales and €1.2 million of variable operational expenses. Since variable costs tend to fluctuate with business volumes, we will need to react quickly in the future by decreasing such costs if we forecast a potential downturn in business volumes or increase in such costs as the market recovers. In addition, our management team sponsors a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce fixed costs. For example, we launched the broader roll-out of Millenium, our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, and we plan to accelerate the roll-out across our French network to be completed by the first quarter of 2023. Millenium is already live in all brokerage agencies since January 2022. We have invested significant resources in Millenium including a team currently consisting of 68 developers in order to build this innovative and advanced real estate platform. Our financial condition and results of operations are impacted by our ability to successfully implement Millenium and other initiatives to improve our operational performance. We believe that the improved standardization and digitization Millenium offers, will allow us to reduce administrative inefficiencies and achieve greater productivity. In parallel to the deployment of Millenium, we have designed a new organizational model called Agency of the Future which was implemented following the roll-out of Millenium in France in 2022. Our vision for Agency of the Future sets out four key goals (i) industrialize tasks with low added value; (ii) distinguish ourselves thanks to our expertise in joint property management and rental management; (iii) have close proximity to our clients; (iv) reinforce our attractiveness for staff. As a result of this new organization model, we expect to generate significant cost and efficiency gains mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains resulting from the digitization and automation of certain tasks previously done manually (such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges). We believe Millenium and Agency of the Future will enable us to achieve greater organization among our businesses allowing our employees to focus on customer satisfaction with the potential to lead to improved customer retention. In the coming years, we plan to fully digitize all business of our businesses, internal processes and our customer relationship management with Millenium. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures in connection with Millenium and Agency of the Future were €18.7 million, consisting of €15.4 million for the development and €3.4 million for the deployment of Millenium. We anticipate capital expenditures of €39.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, consisting of €12.7 million for the development and €3.1 million for the deployment of Millenium. In the next 18 to 24 months, we estimate approximately €5.6 million of revenue gains as a result of efficiencies due to Millenium and Agency of the Future. We also believe that we will experience additional gains in the following years as a result of these projects.

We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is dedicated to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our five geographical regions, which we plan to expand into the UK. We are likely to continue to undertake expansion projects in the future to support geographic growth and profitability and improve the breadth and quality of our service offerings. The number of acquisitions we undertake depends on the quality and pricing of potential targets available for purchase at a given time. Additionally, a key point of focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary reason we decline to pursue a target after entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of their customer accounting. By law, we are required to have separate accounts for our Joint Property Management ----- customers and if a target has poor customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances, complying with applicable law or integrating such target’s systems into our own. The price paid for a particular acquisition depends in part on the target entity’s revenues and cost base, along with competition to acquire the business. Our results of operations are therefore impacted by the quality of our due diligence, as well as by our success in integrating any acquired businesses into ours and extracting synergies, gains and cost savings from such acquisitions. Following an acquisition, we integrate the companies into our existing group structure and consolidate all administrative functions, such as payroll, human resources, IT, procurement, sales and marketing, finance and treasury and other support functions, with our central headquarters. Acquisitions we complete may also lead to improved margins and customer retention through, among other measures, the offering of ancillary services to an expanding customer base in a wider geographic network and the leveraging of our scale to procure additional premium partnerships and favorable pricing terms in our utility contracts for our customers. These initiatives have contributed to the successful integration of the acquisitions that we have made and the realization of synergies from such acquisitions. As a result of integrating the acquired business into our existing business, we may also experience an increase in one-off costs such as IT and other integration costs, accounting costs, severance costs, real estate lease agreements termination penalties, potential retention bonuses for key employees, cost related to the rebranding or other expenditures. Therefore our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place may be affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated results from the date of their combination or acquisition. We have a track record of implementing a majority of synergies immediately following the acquisition and are able to quickly realize the impact of the synergies, gains and costs savings from the acquisition. However, it may take up to 18 months to realize our expected costs and efficiency gains for an acquired business.

In particular, since 2022 we have changed the allocation of certain business units within our different divisions, with a view to provide a clearer business segmentation. This is a change from the way that the financial data was presented prior to 2022, therefore in order to ensure comparability and accommodate like-for-like comparison between the financial data presented as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we restated certain line items in the table entitled “Revenue” which summarizes our revenue performance per division, as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

As a result, the revenue breakdown by division in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements is not directly comparable with the revenue breakdown by division in our Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other _Data—Summary Other Financial Information and Operating Data—Revenue Breakdown by Division.” 2020 Restatement_ In the consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2020, the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020 and the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2020 were restated to give effect to application of the definitive decision of the IFRS IC on the attribution of employee benefit to periods of service. In May 2021, the IASB endorsed the conclusions of the IFRS IC dated December 2020 regarding the basis for calculating the period of service to which an entity attributes benefit for a particular defined benefit plan. According to these conclusions, entities should consider periods of benefit entitlement and caps on those periods when recognizing benefit obligations. Whereas the approach most commonly used in France was to recognize benefit obligations on a straight-line basis from the date the employee in question joined the entity to the date of their retirement, the IFRS IC considers that benefit obligations should only be recognized on a straight-line basis over the number of years of employee service immediately before the retirement age, and that said years of service should be capped. The Group took this new approach into account when measuring its employee benefit obligations as at December 31, 2021. In accordance with IAS 8 and in the absence of any transitional provisions to the contrary, any changes resulting from a final agenda decision issued by the IFRS IC are retrospectively applicable. The impact of this change in accounting policy was recognized in the statement of financial position retrospectively as of January 1, 2020, resulting in a €3.5 million decrease in the provision for retirement benefits and a corresponding €2.2 million increase in consolidated equity (net of tax).

In April 2021, the IASB endorsed the conclusions of the IFRS IC dated March 2021 regarding the accounting for configuration or customization costs of a supplier’s application software in a SaaS arrangement. The decision of the IFRS IC confirmed that in most cases, in accordance with IAS 38, such costs shall be recognized as an expense rather than intangible assets since, on the one hand, the customer does not control the software and, on the other hand, the configuration or customization does not generate a resource controlled by the customer that is distinct from the software. These costs shall ----- be accounted for as expenses when (i) such costs are incurred in connection with an in-house software development or a development by a third party provider (not affiliated to the supplier of the SaaS solution) or (ii) such costs are spread for the duration of the SaaS arrangement and the software is developed by the supplier or a sub-contractor. Our review confirmed that costs of configuration and customization of certain SaaS solutions that were historically classified as intangible assets (mainly Workday that is used as an ERP for finance and HR since 2019) did not conform to the criteria outlined by IFRS IC’s position and consequently were required to be classified as expenses. In accordance with IAS 8 and in the absence of any transitional provisions to the contrary, any changes resulting from a final agenda decision issued by the IFRS IC are retrospectively applicable. The impact of this change in accounting policy was recognized in the statement of financial position retrospectively as of January 1, 2021, resulting in a €10.0 million decrease of intangible assets and a corresponding €7.4 million decrease in consolidated equity (net of tax).

Our results include incremental revenues and expenses following the completion date of an acquisition.

We have historically used strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to increase our scale within existing capabilities and to expand our presence in new or existing geographic regions globally. We believe that strategic acquisitions will increase revenue, provide cost synergies and generate incremental income in the long term. _Recent Developments_ In 2022, we entered the UK market through the acquisition of FirstPort, one of the UK’s largest property management services groups and the UK’s largest joint property manager with approximately 315,000 units under management as of March 2022. FirstPort operates primarily in joint property management as well as in the rental management and real estate brokerage markets in England, Scotland and Wales with a strong geographical national coverage, generating revenue of €120 million in 2021 with the support of over 3,800 employees. The purchase price for the acquisition was financed by drawings under Additional Facility B1 under the Senior Credit Facilities and an equity contribution of €114.5 million, signaling continued support from the Sponsors. The acquisition was completed in August 2022 and FirstPort has been fully consolidated in our financial results as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from the date of acquisition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

For additional details on our key performance indicators, see “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Summary Financial and _Other Information—Summary Other Financial and Operating Data.” These measures are not indicative_ of historical operating results, nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These measures are used to monitor our underlying performance and operations. Not all companies calculate these measures in an identical manner and therefore our presentation may not be consistent with similar measures used by other companies.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.6,Key Income Statement Line Items,17.6.1,Revenue,"Revenue results from sales of services within the scope of the ordinary operations of consolidated subsidiaries, less revenue from intragroup transactions. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. In accordance with IFRS 15, we recognize revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to us, and specific criteria are met by each of our businesses, as further described below. _Lease Management and Letting business_ In the lease management line of our Lease Management and Letting business, we act as agent for owners- lessors and fulfil a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These represent separate service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognized separately. Revenue from services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance is recognized on a percentage- of-completion basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue from one-off services is recognized when those services are provided. In our lettings business, revenue is recognized at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted. We collect fees from owners and from lessees. _Joint Property Management business_ From a contractual and legal perspective, our Joint Property Management business is mostly conducted through mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services. All such services are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association. Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis (over time) based on actual amounts billed (costs are in line with the billed amounts). Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and disputes. Transfer Fees are also invoiced directly to a landlord selling its property. Since each additional service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognized when the service is performed. ----- _Esset Valorisation_ Esset Valorisation provides investment strategy consulting and arbitrage (appraisals, lending, block/unit property sales) for institutional customers or wealthy families. Its revenue is recognized at the date the notarized final sale agreement is signed and is based on a percentage of the sale price. _Client accounts_ Interest income generated on client funds, limited to rental cash deposits, is booked in revenue. _Constatimmo_ Constatimmo carries out mandatory technical surveys on premises, as well as inventories of premises for lessees. Its revenue is recognized and measured when the related services are performed. _Optissimmo_ Optissimmo is a rental investment expert. _Tech-Way_ Tech-Way is dedicated to the technical maintenance of housing to help our clients to live and work in secure and healthy environments. Tech-Way provides actionable advice and sustainable solutions for pest control, fire protection, routine maintenance and repair work. _Prowen_ Prowen is an energy purchase central providing services to Joint Property Management buildings. _Real Estate Brokerage business_ Revenue in the transactions business is recognized upon signature of the notarized final sale agreement (acte authentique), which is the date on which control is presumed to have been transferred. _Efficity_ Efficity is an online real estate and brokerage business. _Lodgis_ Lodgis is a real estate agency specialized in renting and selling furnished apartments. _Assurimo_ Assurimo provides property insurance brokerage services. Revenue under comprehensive property insurance and comprehensive homeowners’ insurance policies is recognized over the term of the cover, since services in this brokerage business are provided on a straight-line basis. _Seiitra_ Seiitra provides specialist IT property services and developed the Powimo software, which it markets through its software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions model. These property management tools offer the full suite of functionalities needed to keep accounting records for client accounts and to manage suspense accounts, jointly owned properties and rentals, as well as the budget of jointly owned property associations. Maintenance fees are recognized on a straight-line, percentage-of-completion basis, since the corresponding services are provided over time. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Non-recurring items are limited, unusual and/or irregular items of a material amount and we classify these items into three main categories: (i) M&A non-recurring integrations charges, (ii) restructuring/transformation non-recurring charges and (iii) corporate non-recurring charges, which include costs of implementation of third party SaaS software (treated as capital expenditures until the financial year ended December 31, 2021). ----- These items include impacts of changes in the scope of consolidation, goodwill impairment, and amortization and impairment charged against trademarks. If material, non-recurring items also include the effects of certain unusual transactions such as capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring fees, fees relating to major claims and disputes, and any other income or expenses likely to affect the comparability of recurring operating profit (loss) from one period to the next. For transactions directly related to external growth and projects to transform or restructure the business (particularly mergers and reorganizations), a detailed procedure is in place to identify, classify and validate any transactions of a non-recurring nature.

However, management periodically reviews the positions adopted in tax returns for situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Where applicable, a provision is set aside based on the amounts payable to the tax authorities. Income tax expense includes the amounts reported by French subsidiaries in respect of the CVAE tax assessed on value added, since we consider this tax meets the definition of income tax set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes.

This increase was primarily driven by a €13.3 million increase in the Lease Management and Letting business, driven by both an increase of dwellings under management and an increase in pricing in our lease management business, which was partially offset by lower volumes in letting due to a softer market as well as a €26.3 million increase in the Joint Property Management business, driven mainly by an increase of dwellings under management. Revenue for the Real Estate Brokerage business in France increased by €8.4 million, or 7.1%, from €117.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €125.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of AGDA and a positive mix and price effect, partially offset by a decrease of volumes due to a challenging market environment. Revenue for the Digital business in France increased by €9.3 million, or 11.6%, from €80.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €89.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the strong performance of Efficity, notably due to the recruitment of new agents. Revenue for the B2B business in France increased by €6.2 million, or 16.5%, from €37.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €44.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by recent acquisitions and new contracts. Revenue for our International business increased by €35.7 million, or 34.3%, from €103.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €139.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by acquisitions in our international markets, partially offset by reduced brokerage activities due to a challenging market environment, including client churn as a side effect of staff turnover that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, Switzerland presented strong growth, driven by acquisitions in the German-speaking part of the country, and the fact that COVID-19 restrictions occurred in the nine months ended September ----- 30, 2021 and did not recur in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In addition, Benelux grew by 29.3%, partly driven by the acquisition of Codabel and Cushman & Wakefield Asset Services Belgium. Revenue in Germany grew 33.4% mainly due to acquisitions but was partly offset by some client churn due to side effect of staff turnover following the COVID-19 crisis. The UK performance reflects revenue from completion of the FirstPort acquisition which closed in August 2022. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased by €1.0 million, or 22.0%, from €4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to gains on client accounts and an indirect impact of the increased activity. _Purchases consumed and external charges_ Purchases consumed and external charges increased by €27.8 million, or 17.0%, from €163.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €191.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the growth at Efficity, leading to higher commissions paid to agents. _Taxes other than on income_ Taxes other than on income increased by €1.6 million, from €13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher income tax paid as a result of our external growth during the period. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €49.1 million, or 11.3%, from €436.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €485.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a higher average number of FTEs, notably from acquisitions. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses decreased by €0.5 million, or 10.4%, from €4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 have, as a percentage of revenue, decreased slightly at 0.4% of revenue, as compared to 0.5% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in charges in the France Property Management segment, partially offset by an increase in charges in countries other than France. _Net additions to depreciation, amortization and impairment_ Net additions to depreciation, amortization, impairment and provisions increased by €9.8 million, or 12.2%, from €80.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to €90.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher amortization of the IFRS 16 right of use, which was mainly driven by our external growth during the period. _Non-recurring operating income (expenses)_ Non-recurring operating expenses increased by €41.5 million, or 49.8%, from a net expense of €83.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to a net expenses of €124.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

This increase was primarily driven by the impact of consolidating companies acquired in 2021, as well as the embedded impact of companies consolidated in 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on our rental management business (essentially affecting amounts collected under commercial leases and incidental fees) as well as on letting activities and incidental fees earned on jointly owned properties (fees on transfer duties, reminders, renovation work and vacancies). Revenue for the Real Estate Brokerage business in France increased by €31.6 million, or 25.3%, from €125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €156.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the positive effect on the number of sales and pricing terms due to the end of COVID-19 related restrictions. Revenue for the Digital business in France increased by €26.2 million, or 32.6%, from €80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €106.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our cash needs relate primarily to capital and other expenditures for meeting debt service requirements and funding our working capital requirements, which are primarily costs related to our acquisitions. The components of our working capital are trade receivables and deferred income, trade payables and prepaid expenses, tax and employee related working capital. We believe that, based on our current cash flows, these sources of liquidity, together with existing available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditure and debt service for at least the next 12 months. We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of the Issue Date, after giving effect to the Transactions and to drawings under the Additional Facilities and the use of proceeds therefrom, we expect to have €3,208.4 million of indebtedness, comprising primarily of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes, the Term Loan Facilities and lease liabilities. We will also be able to borrow up to €437.5 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon certain conditions described further under “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” We may also, from time to time, raise bilateral_ facilities for the purpose of financing future acquisitions. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future opportunities and capital needs, or pursue business opportunities and activities. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with a leverage ratio, under certain circumstances, in order for us to continue to be able to draw funds under the Revolving Credit Facility. We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the other factors discussed in “—Key _Factors Affecting Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors.” We cannot guarantee that our business_ will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Additional Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Estimates and underlying assumptions are determined based on information available at the end of the reporting period and are reviewed on a regular basis in light of past experience and other factors deemed reasonable given the circumstances. These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Where applicable, ----- a sensitivity analysis may be performed if the estimates are material. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. _Measurements used in testing goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment_ The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. As with any estimate, the assumptions used in these calculations are partly based on uncertain factors and may therefore need to be adjusted in subsequent periods. The notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum set out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same notes. _Measurement of leases_ IFRS 16 requires entities to use a significant degree of judgement as well as certain key estimates. These involve determining: - whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised; - the lease term; - the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments; and - the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the contract. The main assumptions we use to prepare the audited financial statements are described in the notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. _Measurement of provisions_ We use the best estimate of our commitments and obligations to calculate the corresponding provisions. _Measurement of employee benefits_ We operate both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. The notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum set out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. We consider that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. _Measurement of fair value (Level 1)_ We use fair value on a recurring basis in our statement of financial position to measure unlisted derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents. ----- _Measurement of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax expense_ Our tax position is based on our best estimate of future taxable earnings. _Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination_ The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount. _Assessment of criteria for identifying discontinued operations_ In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, we are required to exercise judgement in determining whether an asset or group of assets meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. IFRS 5 criteria are also used to identify any assets to be classified as discontinued operations. These assessments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period in light of changes in the relevant facts and circumstances. In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, we use our judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements: - present a true and fair view of our financial position, financial performance and cash flows; - reflect the economic substance of transactions; and - are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

It refers to the assistance on the day-to-day operations of the property typically related to financial management, legal assistance, conflict handling, etc., for an individual residential unit (which may be a joint property or condominium). On the lease management level, property management companies take care of tenancy agreements, rent collection, account and reporting, tax and insurance claims, maintenance or legal compliance. The property management providers are appointed by the owner of the individual unit(s), typically a private landlord. Joint property management refers to the management of joint property (copropriété), i.e. the management of shared property of joint ownership associations, activities include financial management, structural support and legal assistance. In the joint property management segment, the services provided include organization of general assemblies, a pre-determined number of visits per year for inspection, coordination of maintenance efforts and accounting, bill payment, and building fee collection. The property management provider assumes the role of trustee (syndic) after appointment by the general assembly of joint owners.

Pricing for lease management is typically fixed as a percentage of rent (ranging from 2 to 10%, and on average 6 to 8% of annual rent). While prices in terms of percentages have remained stable, rent for residential real estate grew at 0.7% per annum from 2013 to 2019, with a recent trend of increased acceleration (1.7% from 2018 to 2019). Prices for joint property management are expected to grow at 1 to 2% per annum between 2019 and 2024 (excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent inflationary pressures).

In the near future, the market is expected to grow at approximately 2.5 to 3% per annum between 2019 and 2024, largely in line with historical levels, reaching €4.18 billion in 2024. This remains subject to any impact that may stem from general market changes, economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent inflationary pressures. Price increases are expected to be the main growth driver (approximately 1.1% per annum between 2019 and 2024), with some contributions from building activity (approximately 0.7% per annum between 2019 and 2024) and to a lesser extent outsourcing penetration (approximately 0.3% per annum between 2019 and 2024). Prices have increased across residential and commercial segments in the recent past between 2015 and 2019, driven mostly by increasing rent (especially for office spaces, driven by shortage). These trends are expected to continue in the near future. Unlike in France or Switzerland, outsourcing activity in the German market has not followed a clear trend and is not expected to do so in the short term.

Our business lines include: - French Residential Real Estate Services (“RRES”): (a) _Joint property management (our “JPM business”): In our Joint Property Management business, we are mandated by landlords to manage jointly owned building areas and equipment and to ensure compliance with joint ownership regulations. We are the French market leader in Joint Property Management, managing over 1,765,964 dwellings in France for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. We are generally hired by an apartment building homeowners’ board to provide common services to all residents under contracts that are typically one year in length, subject to renewal.

Once a landlord mandates us to sell their apartment, this mandate covers the entire business process from buyer identification to cash collection. We closed over 12,994 transactions in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and our Brokerage business generated €125.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. - Our other services include: (a) _French B2B Services: Esset, our B2B business, comprises all lines of business with commercial and institutional customers. Our Esset business line includes Esset Management, our wealth management and consulting services for commercial and office properties firm, and Esset Valorisation, which markets properties by blocks or lots.

For example, we may provide services to an insurance institution, a B2B customer, that owns and rents residential apartments, commercial space and corporate office space and we are able to service their needs in each of these capacities. Our B2B business in France generated €44.0 million in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In 2021, we acquired Humakey and Cogeva to strengthen our B2B business and expand our presence in the high-end and bespoke services space. (b) _French Digital Services: Our Digital Services business includes our businesses that rely on a digital platform and is comprised of Efficity, Lodgis, Assurimo and Seiitra. Efficity is an online real estate valuation and brokerage activity operated with a business model based on independent sales agents. Lodgis is a real estate agency specialized in renting and selling furnished units, Assurimo is a specialized property insurance brokerage unit and Seiitra is a business-specific IT services business. Our Digital Services business in France generated €89.4 million in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

We continue to expand our presence in these international geographies through a robust acquisition pipeline. For a further detailed description of our businesses, see “—Our Businesses.” We were founded in 1972 and have since established ourselves as the leading European RRES, with over 16,700 employees across Europe as of September 30, 2022. Our recent growth has been marked by achievements in operations, digitization, our successful M&A track record and our IT and ----- communications infrastructure. We believe our success is the result of a unique integrated ecosystem of real estate services providing the opportunity for cross-selling of recurring and additional services and growth through bolt-on acquisitions. The following diagram provides a breakdown of our revenue by business for the for the nine months ended September 30, 2022: (1) Lease Management and Letting revenues also include revenue generated from interest income on our customer accounts, Foncia Immo Neuf and Holiday Rental. The RRES market in the jurisdictions in which we operate remains largely fragmented. According to a third-party report prepared in 2019 the French property management market was estimated to be worth approximately €12 billion (excluding rental services and brokerage), of which approximately €5.3 billion was under external management, along with an estimated €1.2 billion market for rental services. However, greater regulation in France and the increasing need to invest in the digitization of services has made it more difficult and time consuming for private landlords to keep property management inhouse, leading to the increased outsourcing and penetration rate of properties under external management in the residential property management market. These trends towards increased regulation and digitization have also led to the growing consolidation of the highly fragmented market, enabling us to capitalize on small bolt-on, strategic acquisitions and increase our market positioning and scale. Our size provides us with a competitive advantage against smaller and local competitors as we can industrialize processes to better leverage our cost base, replicate best practices across our network to ensure consistent quality of service and adapt more easily to regulatory changes. As a result, we made 55 acquisitions in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, both in our primary French market and in other geographies, including FirstPort in the UK, representing 29,069 new Lease Management dwellings and 553,981 new Joint Property Management dwellings and €261.1 million of acquired revenues. We have a robust acquisition pipeline in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK and a strong team of approximately 40 employees and five trainees dedicated to post acquisition integration.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

As of August 2019, we were the number one player in the French real estate services market, with approximately 13% market share, according to an international report provider. As of September 30, 2022, we managed approximately 2.1 million dwellings in France, which is approximately two times the number of dwellings managed by our next closest competitor according ----- to publically available information for the year ended 2020. Outside of France, we also hold leading positions in Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK. As of September 30, 2022, we operated over 114 branches in these countries, which collectively accounted for 14.8% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In 2022, we entered the UK market through the acquisition of FirstPort, one of the UK’s largest property services groups and the UK’s largest joint property manager with approximately 315,000 units under management as of March 2022, and has a market share of approximately 11%, twice the size of its closest competitor in the UK. FirstPort operates primarily in joint property management as well as in the rental management and real estate brokerage markets in England, Scotland and Wales with a strong geographical national coverage, generating revenue of €120 million in 2021 with the support of over 3,800 employees. FirstPort has an in-house built digital platform which enables it to offer a marketleading, fully automated and scalable service proposition which supports its continuous growth alongside a strong organic development, mobilization of a secured order book (recurring revenue streams with high visibility) and accretive acquisitions. Our scale, operations and service offerings provide us with a clear competitive advantage. Our centralized processes result in lower internal costs and enable improved customer service compared to our typically small, individual-owned competitors. Our comprehensive range of innovative services, such as FONCIA 24/7 (our assistance service for our joint property management customers), and Assurimo (our real estate insurance service), differentiate us from competitors. Our comprehensive network of over 500 branches covering all major French cities is one of the largest offerings in the market and results in close proximity to our customers and the dwellings that we manage; unique market positioning in negotiations with third-party repair and maintenance service suppliers resulting in decreased costs; and financial resources that allow us to expand our customer portfolio through acquisitions. We have been able to successfully enter markets through acquisitions and expanded our operating geography, despite the regulatory and technological requirements that create barriers to participation in the real estate services market. Our regional and national regulatory and real estate industry expertise and our leadership team’s extensive experience in the real estate services industry are key to meeting and complying with such requirements. Our strong reputation for quality, service and multi-branded strategy have also supported our ability to grow in existing markets and enter new markets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.2,Loyal and diverse customer base and synergetic business model in an attractive and resilient market,"Our large and diversified client base, integrated ecosystem of residential real estate services and high customer retention rates drive a high level of recurring revenues (75% in 2020 and 72% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022). We have grown our diversified customer base to approximately 1.8 million dwellings in our French Joint Property Management business and over 376,000 dwellings in our French Lease Management business as at September 30, 2022. Through our synergetic business model, we are able to cross sell our services to our diverse customer portfolio across our business lines, which in turn leads to further organic growth. For example, our proven ability to cross-sell is highlighted by the high penetration rates of Assurimo, our specialized property insurance brokerage unit (providing property insurance, homeowners’ insurance policies and brokerage services) through which we currently provide building insurance (multi-risque immeubles) contracts to 49.7% and household insurance (multi-risque _habitation) contracts to 34.3% of our French Joint Property Management buildings, respectively._ Similarly, we currently provide technical services to approximately 104,220 contracts which represent 27.7% of our French RRES Lease Management customers through our dedicated business, Constatimmo. We believe that we are well positioned to target new customers, including B2B customers, given our knowledge regarding fulfilling requirements for our B2C customers. The addressable markets in which we operate are characterized by high outsourcing rates, with a high and stable portion of joint property or condominium owners (85% in France) under external ----- management, as of August 2019 using services like our Joint Property Management business. Property owners tend to rely on expert services such as ours due to the volume of work and amount of legal and accounting know-how required to directly interface with tenants and other counterparties. Moreover, landlords rarely switch leasing managers during a tenancy, given the risks and costs involved in switching service providers and the limited potential benefit, resulting in a high customer net retention rate of 95.1% in our Joint Property Management business and 91.2% in our Lease Management business for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The UK market is also characterized by a loyal customer base, as evidenced by FirstPort with a net retention rate of approximately 98% in the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that through the integrated ecosystem of high-quality services we consistently provide we have established high customer retention rates, and long lasting customer relationships, certain of which last more than 20 years. Moreover, 36.2% of our customers from our Joint Property Management business in France entered into contracts of three or more years and 23.8% for two to three years for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Due to our broad and diverse customer base, we are not reliant on any particular customer. According to an international report provider, the French property management market is estimated to be €12.2 billion in August 2019, of which €5.3 billion is captured by property management companies, with the rest serviced in-house. The externally serviced property management market has grown by approximately 2% annually between 2014 and 2019. This stable growth has been driven by population dynamics and the construction of collective units. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow through acquisition of customer portfolios, cross-selling of related services to our large client base and the addition of new revenue opportunities for our existing services.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.3,Strong and predictable cash flow generation with an inflation resilient business model,"We have a track record of steady cash flow generation, driven by a high level of recurring revenues, which has enabled us to regularly deleverage. Our trend of high EBITDA conversion rates has continued with a Pre-IFRS-16 EBITDA Conversion Rate, of approximately 85.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 81.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Despite our regular M&A activity, our discretionary spend on acquisitions provides us with flexibility to manage our cash flow and reduce our financial leverage. Further, our business requires limited maintenance capital expenditures (accounting for approximately 4.2% and 4.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively), and is characterized by limited working capital requirements. Our revenue increased by 12.2% to €943.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, up from €840.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and increased by 19.3% to €1,146.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our margin resilience is supported by an adaptable cost structure for the more cyclical flow Brokerage business, as Brokerage salary costs include a significant variable portion that is indexed on commissions. Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 27.7% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 28.2% and 26.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our recurring, stable revenue is in part due to our complementary business profiles across our branches, experienced management and sales force teams, and fee-based services in connection with our Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Letting businesses which accounted for 65.2% of our revenue in France for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. In addition, our high proportion of recurring revenues (75% in 2020 and 72% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022) and balanced portfolio of services split between stock and flow businesses with limited correlation have supported our resilience during adverse economic conditions, achieving a substantially stable performance in 2020 despite unprecedented government measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our business model is resilient to inflationary pressures, in particular as a result of our ability to pass through a portion of our cost increases and of the limited impact of inflation on our ----- business in general. Most of our contracts are either subject to an annual pricing assessment or contain inflation adjustment mechanisms, which allow us to effectively pass-through inflationary impact to our customers. In addition, our fees are typically derived as a proportion of rent, and we, therefore, benefit from price increases occurring in an inflationary environment. Due to the nature of our business, we have a relatively limited exposure to energy and gas price increases, and the energy saving measures that we have put in place allow us to further mitigate any such impact. We estimate that the negative impact from elevated levels of inflation on EBITDA for our French business in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was approximately €2.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strengths,18.13.4,Continuous investments in operational improvement through technology reinforces our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains,"We continuously invest in cutting edge technology in order to offer the best multi-channel services to our customers. Since 2017, we have upgraded a significant portion of our IT and communication infrastructure including utilizing a mix of integrated and outsourced solutions, transitioning to a single telecom provider, and streamlining our finance and human resources functions with Workday, which enabled us to quickly and effectively transition to a work-from-home environment during the COVID19 pandemic. We have also leveraged our technological know-how combined with our knowledge of the real estate industry to design and launch our new ERP system, Millenium. Millenium integrates all of our IT and resource planning functions into one database to better meet our customers’ needs and address internal business challenges. Millenium increases the digitization of our activities with the aim of helping customers by creating greater transparency and improving our operations with standardized, digital processes to increase efficiency and to improve the speed at which we can serve our customers. We believe our high levels of investment in IT for our corporate platform and customer interface service such as over recent years give us a competitive edge in the current environment. Millenium was piloted at several of our branches in France and launched at all brokerage operations in France in early 2022 prior to the roll-out to our broader network starting in November 2022. Further, we commenced the roll-out of Millenium at our RRES operations which is now in use for 5.6% of our Joint Property Management dwellings and 6.0% of our Lease Management dwellings. We aim to accelerate the rollout of Millenium in the first quarter of 2023. The digitization, standardization and automation offered by Millenium complement our already synergetic business model and will allow us to more quickly leverage our customer database to identify cross-selling opportunities leading to greater operating efficiencies and inter-business synergies. We believe that Millenium’s compatibility with big data, AI and IoT, will allow us to explore new business opportunities and provide access to a number of revenue-enhancing opportunities. For example, we have developed a new operational model called “Agency of the Future” which will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real estate services and aims at improving client satisfaction and reducing our customer churn rate, which we believe will, in turn, lead to greater opportunities for organic growth. Furthermore, we also believe that the gains of Millenium and the development of Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €25.0 million in the next 24 months. We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technology to continually improve our internal operations in order to provide our customers with product offerings that meet their needs and make us the number one choice among residential real estate service providers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

We completed over 330 acquisitions since January 2016, which represented €814.1 million of acquired revenues. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we entered the UK market with the acquisition of FirstPort and we also completed 54 acquisitions in our primary French market and in other geographies, representing 29,069 new Lease Management dwellings and 553,981 new Joint Property Management dwellings and €261.1 million of acquired revenues. These 55 acquisitions contributed to our Adjusted EBITDA, which reached €409.9 million for the twelve months ----- ended September 30, 2022, as compared to €348.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Consolidation is a natural trend in the highly fragmented markets we operate in, accelerated by increasing regulations, and we play a key role in the market by defining new quality standards and unrivalled execution processes. We have a strong M&A team, with a disciplined approach that is dedicated to identifying, diligencing, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions in our five geographical regions, which we plan to expand in the UK. Our long-standing integration experience, including a dedicated post-acquisition integration team, enables us to extract full synergy potential from acquired businesses, with both cross-selling and cost synergies.

Our management team comes from various industries and geographies and is supported by four heads of region in France and four heads of region in international markets, who have extensive experience in real estate and enable us to provide our customers with tailored expertise and service. We believe that the collective industry knowledge and leadership of our management team positions them well to continue our successful organic and external growth and execute our strategies. Further, our management team encourages growth through a focus on operational efficiency and innovation including through the management’s dynamic external growth policy that enabled us to, among others, establish our market leading presence in the UK, Benelux, Switzerland and Germany, successfully divest our non-core businesses to focus on our core, synergetic businesses and more recently, by the ongoing overhaul of our IT infrastructure, including the development and deployment of Millenium and enabling our planned transition to our new operational model, “Agency of the Future.” This is demonstrated by the consistent increase in our revenues which increased by 12.2% to €943.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, up from €840.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and increased by 19.3% to €1,146.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from €961.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Our most recent digital innovation, Millenium, an in-house developed ERP system that is cloud-based and will allow us to fully digitalize our businesses. We believe that Millenium will allow us to better, more efficiently serve our customers, cross-sell across our services and therefore capture greater market share from existing customers and generate business from new customers. Our IT and data platforms are subject to a process of continuous improvement and innovation, which we support with ongoing investments, such as the team of 68 developers we hired in connection with the development of Millenium. We believe that our robust investments in our IT and data platforms provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses have been required to transition to a work-from-home environment. Additionally, our ongoing and historical use of big data, AI and IoT to create new business opportunities enables us to maintain a cutting edge development program while minimizing the risks traditionally associated with experimentation. For example, we have developed our new operational model, Agency of the Future, which we believe will generate significant savings, mainly related to (i) staff costs synergies from the optimization of the ratios of middle and back-office functions to front-office employees and an increase in productivity and significant reduction of time spent on manual and repetitive processes and (ii) gains ----- resulting from the digitization and automation of certain tasks that were previously done manually, such as reminder fees or the collection of postal charges. Since 2018, we have invested approximately €155.0 million into our IT projects, and we believe that the gains of Millenium and Agency of the Future will positively impact our EBITDA by €25.0 million in the next 24 months. We have developed, and continue to develop, innovative solutions based on emerging trends that are aimed at providing our customers with the highest quality, optimal solutions for their real estate needs.

We have been successful in achieving incremental organic revenue growth through active cross selling efforts across our ancillary services. We intend to continue to benefit from this growth through expanding our service offerings by introducing new business lines. In addition, we aim to further reduce our customer churn rate in Joint Property Management by improving client satisfaction, including as a result of the overhaul of our IT systems and operating model. In addition, we have made, and intend to continue to make, selected bolt-on acquisitions in our core French market and the other geographies in which we operate to supplement our organic growth, solidify our current market position and expand our presence. We have a strong track record of successfully identifying, completing and integrating opportunistic acquisitions. From January 2016 to September 2022, we completed over 330 acquisitions. We believe that our strong brand, broad platform and our dynamic infrastructure have allowed us to generate growth and operating cash flows through acquisitions. Recent examples of targeted acquisitions in France that have accelerated our growth and have allowed us to better address customer needs include Billon and AGDA, in our RRES business, Humakey in B2B and in Belgium, with Syncura. We intend to continue to further strengthen our strong position in the market by pursuing opportunistic acquisitions in our existing geographies to accelerate our growth, and we aim to do so by leveraging our internal expertise.

We strategically pursue new markets while ----- remaining committed to expanding in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK as these markets offer us proximity to existing customers and expansion opportunities in countries where we have established brand recognition. In 2022, we entered the UK market through the acquisition of FirstPort, one of the UK’s largest property services groups and the UK’s largest joint property manager with approximately 315,000 units under management as of March 2022. With this acquisition, Emeria became the global leader in residential property management as well as the number one player in the largest European markets: the UK, France and Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our strategic focus on the expansion of our geographical footprint in Europe would have allowed us to generate approximately €274 million of International Revenue, taking into account FirstPort as if the acquisition of FirstPort had closed on January 1, 2021 (based on an aggregation of the Group’s International Revenue and FirstPort’s revenues without pro forma adjustments, each for the year ended December 31, 2021).

From January 2016 to September 2022, we have completed over 330 acquisitions, primarily within Joint Property Management and Lease Management and Letting.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.16,Our Businesses,18.16.1,Residential Real Estate Services (France),"The residential real estate services in France, operating primarily under the Foncia brand, represented 57.7% of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 67.8% of our total revenue generated in France for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Revenue from this business primarily comprises (i) jointly owned property management fees, (ii) rental management fees (including rent payment and occupancy guarantee fees), and (iii) letting fees, which allow us to maintain stable revenues. _Management of Jointly Owned Properties_ In our Joint Property Management business, we assist our customers in managing common building areas, features and costs in their jointly owned properties by providing technical and accounting management. These management services include (i) providing information and communicating on a regular basis with the joint property owners, (ii) organizing and managing general meetings of joint property owners by preparing the agenda, summons, minutes, etc., (iii) managing the upkeep of the joint property as a whole, (iv) controlling costs by drawing up a budget, (v) obtaining bids from potential suppliers, (vi) providing a breakdown of joint property charges, (vii) collecting funds and amounts due for the joint property accounts, (viii) providing bookkeeping services, (ix) monitoring contract performance, and (x) providing mass procurement offers for joint property owners and leveraging our large purchasing power to offer attractive prices to our customers on expenses such as gas and other utilities. We also provide direct access to all Foncia services on a unique customer portal, MyFoncia, and offer around-the-clock customer service. From a contractual and legal perspective, our Joint Property Management business is conducted primarily through mandates. We take the role of trustee (syndic) after appointment by the homeowners’ board or general assembly of joint owners. We calculate fees on a flat-rate basis, which leads to relatively stable and recurring revenue. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, including (i) preparing, convening and organizing general meetings, (ii) managing the joint owners’ council or general assembly (iii) managing the financial operations, including bill payments and collection of building fees, (iv) keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association (v) managing the jointly owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations and (vi) carrying out periodic visits and inspections of the jointly owned property. We also receive additional incidental fees such as transfer fees when a landlord selling a dwelling requires a book balance report called a “transfer report,” reminder fees, fees on insurancerelated claim management services, maintenance and repair commissions on third parties invoices and additional post office charges. These variable fees comprise 24.6% of our total Joint Property Management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. All such services are treated as an overall performance. These different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., the management of the jointly owned property association. Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service. As of September 30, 2022, we had 1,765,964 dwellings under our management of jointly owned properties, generating a revenue of €269.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing 28.6% of our total revenue for the same period. ----- _Lease Management and Letting_ Our Lease Management and Letting business is comprised of Lease Management and rental services. On the Lease Management side of the business, we manage an owner’s-lessor’s rented apartment and provide assistance on the day-to-day operations of the property, typically related to financial management, legal assistance and handling conflicts. We are appointed by the owner of the individual unit, typically a private landlord, and we act as agent for owners-lessors to fulfil a number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These key services primarily include: (i) routine management services such as rent reviews and collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, and sending rent receipts and deposits to lessees, (ii) other one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of documentation, management of claims, administrative filings and requests for subsidies, (iii) technical management services, such as coordinating on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys and preparation of essential information documents for lessees, (iv) insurance against unpaid rent and (v) other insurance such as for vacant premises or property damage. Lease Management fees are comprised of a base fee for the contracted services described above and, in some instances, other additional fees such as fees in connection with helping file tax forms or fees related to rent payment guarantees. We offer rent payment guarantees (“Garantie de loyers impayés” or “rent payment guarantee”) to certain residential landlords in France for whom we provide property management services and an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation” or “occupancy guarantee”) to a small number of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant for selected apartments in new dwellings. In September 2022, approximately 66% of residential dwellings in France were covered by the rent payment guarantee, and approximately 13% of rentals are covered by the occupancy guarantee. We believe we have a strong ability to assess credit risk when offering these guarantees and undertake a detailed process to select eligible tenants and dwellings. We refer to the new unpaid rents as a result of defaults under the occupancy guarantee each month as “flow of unpaid rent,” and the total sum of unpaid rents per month as our “stock of unpaid rent.” In September 2022, €115.9 million of rent revenues were covered by the rent payment guarantee, for which we experienced €3.6 million new unpaid rent (compared to a 2021 monthly average of new unpaid rent of €3.1 million for €108.7 million covered rent revenues) and the cumulative aggregate of unpaid rent was €29.4 million, including outstanding rent payments from previous years. Once rent is reported as unpaid, any payments to landlords under these guarantees are recorded in full as a provision on our balance sheet. By underwriting rent payment guarantees and occupancy guarantees on our own balance sheet, we believe we offer a differentiating and competitive service to customers that smaller competitors would not be able to deliver. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Rent payment and occupancy guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_ As of September 30, 2022, we had 376,262 dwellings under management in our Lease Management and Letting business in France, generating a revenue of €254.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing 27.0% of our total revenue for the same period (this includes Foncia Immo Neuf, CAI and Holiday Rental). Revenues are driven by rent evolution, fees as a percent of rent (on units acquired), and add-on services and volumes are driven by apartments under lease management and tenant mobility rates. We operate primarily in the residential real estate services market, but manage certain commercial real estate properties through Esset. See “—French B2B Services.” Through our renting services, we aim to minimize the vacancy rates of the properties by helping landlords find a suitable tenant and helping tenants find a property to rent. For landlords, we manage ----- the sourcing, screening, and contracting of new tenants, and provide services such as posting advertisements on various real estate portals, showcasing their properties in Foncia branches and providing structured feedback on renting efforts. For tenants, we assist lessees with leasing rental properties and we receive one-off placement fees for these services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we assisted with 52,915 rentals in France. Our services include access to a large number of rental home insurance packages and fixture inventory programs offered by professionals who are available on short notice.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Our average international headcount for employees in 2021 increased to 1,630, compared to 1,430 in 2020. As a result of the closing of the FirstPort acquisition in August 2022, our international services business will represent a greater portion of our group revenue going forward. The chart below provides a revenue breakdown for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 of our international operations by country: _Switzerland_ We entered the Swiss market in 2004 through the acquisition of the real estate services group, GECO. In 2015, we reinforced our position in the French-speaking region of Switzerland with the acquisition of Domicim, and we entered the German-speaking regions of Switzerland in 2019 through the acquisition of Gribi. We have since strengthened our position in German-speaking Switzerland through our 2021 acquisition of Intercity.

While we offer all of our primary services in Switzerland, our Brokerage business is characterized by transactions on whole buildings (sales in blocs), rather than individual units. We are also involved in sales of new buildings for promoters. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, our operations in Switzerland generated €54.2 million in revenue. _Benelux_ We entered the Belgium market under the Trevi brand, which we acquired in May 2013 through a reverse takeover that enabled us to retain a successful local management team.

In addition, we have 28 Trevi Partner agencies which are operated by independent third parties under the Trevi brand.

In January 2022 we acquired Codabel and the property management business of Cushman & Wakefield Asset Services Belgium, which will be combined under the Esset Property Management brand to cover Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

FirstPort operates primarily in the joint property management, rental management and real estate brokerage markets in England, Scotland and Wales with a strong geographical coverage in each of these nations. FirstPort generated €120 million in revenue and employed over 3,800 employees in 2021. FirstPort operates an in-house digital platform, which enables it to offer a fully automated and readily scalable service proposition and supports FirstPort’s continuous growth through strong organic development, mobilization of the order book and accretive acquisitions.

In addition, 8% of revenues are linked to property transaction levels which are relatively predictable given the portfolio size.

From inception, we have appreciated the importance of creating an efficient platform in order to better serve our customers, and understand the dynamics of our market and improve our employees responsiveness and efficiency. IT systems impact virtually all aspects of our business, including record keeping, customer information processing and storage, data security, marketing and ----- sales, compliance logistics, and practice and performance management. Our IT strategy is driven by the dual goals of promoting growth of our business while ensuring data security. Our most recent digital innovation is Millenium, our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system that we developed in-house, and we launched a go-live version of it in March 2020 at one of our branches in France. We have invested significant resources in Millenium, including a team currently consisting of 68 developers in order to build this innovative and advanced real estate platform. We launched Millenium on all brokerage activities in France in early 2022, and launched the broader rollout of Millenium in our French RRES business in November 2022 (10 Métropoles), initially in operations covering approximately 252,859 Joint Property Management dwellings and 67,701 Lease Management dwellings. We aim to accelerate the roll-out of Millenium across our broader operations in the first quarter of 2023. Millenium includes numerous functionalities and unifies a number of our IT functions at our head office under one centralized database. It is managed by an experienced team of information specialists. Business applications for each of our activities have been developed with Millenium, including our Joint Property Management business, Lease Management and Letting business, and Brokerage Business, as well as our accounting department, support call center and web and mobile applications. Millenium is equipped with an application interface program, which is a technology that allows for a direct access to other software solutions, startups, and business partners. For example, Millenium is connected to Kyriba, an online platform for viewing bank transaction in real time, which we use to manage our Joint Property Management cash transactions involving approximately 120,000 bank accounts. Millenium also functions with Docapost, an online, information technology company, which we utilize to collect and scan checks, and send and receive approximately 3.1 million invoices per year. Millenium provides, among other features, (i) increased digitization of activities, including the ability to use online signatures and receive digital payments, (ii) greater transparency with our customers, as employee progress on customer matters can be seen in real time and customer calls are tracked using tickets, (iii) significant automation of the accounting activities, including automated rent reminders and rent payments (iv) the ability to better leverage our customer database to create inter-business synergies in compliance with European GDPR regulations, and (v) standardized processes across our businesses and substantial efficiencies due to a high degree of automation. Millenium also includes MyFoncia, a web and mobile app platform designed to improve customer experience through automation, digitization, and improved productivity for our customers to use for all of their service needs. In parallel to the deployment of Millenium, we have designed a new operational model called Agency of the Future which was implemented following the roll-out of Millenium in France in 2022. Agency of the Future will utilize Millenium to reorganize the residential real estate services and aims to improve client satisfaction, reducing our customer churn rate and, in turn, leading to greater opportunities for organic growth. See “Summary—Our Strengths—Continuous investments in operational improvement _through our innovative technology platforms reinforces our competitive position and provides sustainable efficiency gains.”_ In the coming years, as part of our Agency of the Future initiatives, we plan to fully digitalize all business lines, internal processes, and our customer relationship management. In addition, we aim to increase our use of big data, artificial intelligence and IoT and continue to further automate our accounting. We believe that the improved standardization and digitization Millenium offers, will allow us to reduce administrative inefficiencies and achieve greater productivity. In addition, we believe that Millenium will enable us to achieve greater organization among our businesses allowing our employees to focus on customer satisfaction with the potential to lead to improved customer retention. It may also lead to new business opportunities, which could include big data or machine learning and licensing opportunities. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

In addition, we focus on energy transition of buildings under management by developing services and solutions to enable our clients to renovate and finance their dwellings. In 2021, one of our goals related to corporate social responsibility is to ensure that all of our building managers are systematically trained to lead such renovation projects and partner with clients and employees who demonstrate a commitment to the environment.

Our ability to obtain, retain and process such personal data is governed by data protection and privacy regulations and guidance issued by, among others, the European Union, national regulators and, where applicable, recommendations and best practices developed by trade associations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)) became effective as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR provides a common framework for data protection and privacy and regulates the Processing and transfer of Personal Data in the European Union. In the course of our activities, we may be qualified as “Controllers,” or as “Processor,” as defined and governed by GDPR, depending on the services provided and the service agreement entered into. We established our compliance program with GDPR quite early and we comply with the GDPR obligations, and rights for individuals whose Personal Data we Process (“Data Subjects”), including, among others: - accountability and transparency obligations, requiring us to demonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR, including the maintenance of detailed records of Personal Data Processing activities; - appointment of a data protection officer, subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria; - requirements to Process Personal Data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, to Process Personal Data only to the extent necessary for the purposes required, maintain the accuracy of Personal Data, limit the retention of Personal Data for no longer than is necessary, and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures against unauthorized Processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage to Personal Data; - an obligation to provide clear notice of Personal Data Processing activities to Data Subjects, which must include, among other details: the identity of the Controller and the Processor; the nature and purpose of the Processing activities; the legal basis applicable to each Processing activity; the categories of Personal Data Processed, the recipients to whom the Personal Data ----- are disclosed; the rights of the Data Subjects; and details of any cross-border transfers of Personal Data; - an obligation to include certain mandatory contractual terms in agreements with certain service providers which Process Personal Data on our behalf; - restrictions on the export of Personal Data to recipients located in countries outside of the European Economic Area; - requirements to ensure, for each Processing activity, that either (i) there is a valid legal basis in place; or (ii) an exemption or derogation applies; - obligations to consider data protection issues with respect to the development of any new products or services which involve the Processing of Personal Data (“data protection by design”), and to ensure that by default, the amount of Personal Data Processed is limited to what is necessary in the context of the relevant Processing activity (“data protection by default”); - a requirement to undertake a data protection impact assessment with respect to Processing activities that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of relevant Data Subjects; - obligations to comply with the data protection rights conferred on Data Subjects including, in certain circumstances: a right of access to, and rectification of, Personal Data; a right to obtain restriction of Processing; a right to object to Processing; a right to request that Personal Data be transferred to another Controller; a right not to be subject to certain types of profiling or automated decision-making; and a right to request erasing Personal Data; and - an obligation to notify Personal Data Breaches to Supervisory Authorities without undue delay and no later than 72 hours after detection of the relevant Personal Data Breach, except where the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, and an obligation to notify affected Data Subjects without undue delay, unless the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected Data Subjects. The GDPR has therefore strengthened the individual rights of individuals over their personal data and imposes strict requirements on companies processing personal data. In addition, the GDPR introduces fines for serious breaches of up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide revenue or €20 million. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the fine level to impose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data Subjects also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress) in certain circumstances. Data Subjects may bring complaints via the courts, or via Supervisory Authorities, or both, and in some circumstances may have a choice as to the EU Member State(s) in which they bring such claims. We accomplished a review of our data polices with the aim of minimizing data collection and storage so that only the appropriate amount of personal data required for any particular purpose is processed, and establishing protocols to destroy unnecessary datasets and anonymize data wherever possible. In addition, we have put in place and implemented rules, policies and procedures that we strive to maintain and improve, in order to ensure compliance with GDPR.

These rules, policies and procedures, implemented at all levels of our business, apply to the processing of personal data, data storage, retention, preservation, maintenance, protection and management of personal data within the course of our business operations, as well as the transfer of personal data. Our legal team was intensely involved in the implementation of such rules, ----- policies and procedures and reviewed our activities and operations to implement a legal framework that complies with the GDPR requirements.

The Hoguet law requires the execution of specific administrative formalities to be a professional real estate agent including: - holding a professional card (“carte professionnelle”) issued by the president of the territorial chamber of commerce and industry, which is subject to professional aptitude and morality conditions and is renewable every 3 years; - having a financial guarantee from a bank or professional organization for funds held in customer accounts and retaining professional liability insurance. ----- In accordance with this law, we provide financial guarantees to customers equal to the maximum amount of funds held in their account.

This body guarantees reimbursement of any funds deposited with_ them for purchase. The name of the financial guarantor must be displayed in the agents office. Professional real estate agents must have a written mandate authorizing them to negotiate or enter into contracts on behalf of the owner or the property lessor. This mandate must therefore be finalized before any act of mediation or negotiation begins. This mandate must indicate the level of the fees or commission (honoraires) that will be payable and just who will pay it, the buyer or the seller. We maintain a register of such agreements with each agreement numbered and recorded in accordance with the Hoguet Law.

The introduction of the ALUR law has had a number of effects in the way we conduct our operations across our core service offerings, including: - Joint property management: The ALUR law imposes a mandatory obligation on us as joint property managers to register each joint property we manage with the national matriculation register if not yet registered and also requires us to create two dedicated bank accounts for each joint property we manage. The law also introduces model joint property agreements that are applicable in our joint property management service. - Rental management and lettings: The ALUR law regulates which fees can and cannot be charged to tenants and how fees should be shared between tenants and landlords. Depending on the property’s location, it imposes a limit on the renting commission paid by tenants to an amount that must not exceed between €11-€15 per square meter. In addition to this fee cap, tenants can no longer be charged penalties for breaches to rental agreements or for rent payment notices. The law also introduced restrictions on the yearly rental escalations for residential properties in Paris. It also standardized certain administrative requirements for rental contracts through means such as model contracts and rental declaration forms for residential lettings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The law created a new lease called a “mobility lease,” which is a non-renewable lease between one to ten months for certain categories of tenants, such as students and trainees, with flexible termination terms that allow the termination of a lease by the tenant upon the provision of only one months’ notice. Within municipalities of more than 50,000 inhabitants, where there is an imbalance between the supply and demand of housing, the law also imposes an obligation on landlords to set their rent within a range defined by the authorities each year. The introduction of the ELAN law has had a number of effects in the way we conduct our operations across our core service offerings, as it created an incentive for short-term rentals which may reduce the predictability of our revenue. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The PINEL plan provided income tax deductions to private individuals who invested in these new build properties, provided the properties were put up for rent for at least six years. This plan has had a direct impact on fees that property managers can charge for their services. For example, it restricts the freedom of the landlord and tenant to contract with regards to expenses which cannot be recovered from tenants. Non-recoverable expenses include structural repairs and repairs under article 606 of the French Civil Code, taxes such as the “Territorial Economic Contribution” where the landlord is personally liable for payment and the management fees of the landlord linked to rents management. As a result, landlords are no longer able to recover fees from tenants for certain expenses for major repairs, regional economic contribution taxes and fees related to rental management. The PINEL plan also introduced rules governing commercial leases including rules limiting the ability of a landlord to impose rental increases and granting tenants a right of first refusal in the event of the sale of leased commercial property. The plan provides for the mandatory use of national indexes provided by the national statistics bureau of France (INSEE) for the calculation of revised rents for commercial activity premises and is applicable during the life of the lease.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,France,58.3.5,Eviction Laws and the Winter Truce,"_Eviction Laws_ On July 9, 1991 a new law (Loi n° 91-650 du 9 juillet 1991 portant réforme des procédures civiles _d’exécution) introduced the eviction regime into the law of civil enforcement proceedings. This law_ introduces, in article L411-1 of the Code of Civil Enforcement Procedures (Code de Procédure Civile), the condition that an eviction can only take place by virtue of a court decision where the occupiers were notified. A tenant can be evicted for failure to pay the rent when due and also for breaches of lease agreements. In the event that the tenant fails to pay rent, the landlord is required to follow various mandatory steps, including filing of a payment instruction notice (Commandement de payer). This notice sets a time limit for a tenant to pay the outstanding rental and must delivered by a bailiff (huissier _de justice). The time limits provided by this notice are two months for a residential lease and one month_ for a commercial lease. If the tenant fails to pay the rental arears within the stipulated time, the landlord can apply to the court for the cancellation of the lease. Upon the determination of the court proceedings, the court will often provide for an installment payment of the rent arrears and stipulate that the tenant voluntarily move out within a period of two months. The bailiff and the police will forcibly remove the tenant if the tenant fails to move out within this period. _Winter Truce_ The winter truce is the period during which any tenant eviction measure is suspended. This rule was introduced on July 9, 1991 (Loi n° 91-650 du 9 juillet 1991 portant réforme des procédures civiles _d’exécution). The regime provides that a landlord can begin proceedings during the winter truce to seek_ to evict tenants who do not pay rent, or who refuse to leave after receiving the contractual notice period. However, eviction requires a court order from a judge, which can be appealed by the tenant. Once a final judgment is made, the landlord is able to give an eviction order to the tenant with a minimum notice period of at least two months for the tenant to vacate the leased premises (the length of this period will depend on the court order). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the eviction of the tenant cannot take place during the winter truce, which is in effect between November 1 and March 1 of the following year. In 2014, the ALUR law expanded the winter truce period to five full months, from November 1 to March 31 of the following year. This period was extended to July 10 as an exceptional measure for 2020 only, as part of the emergency measures taken by the French government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,France,58.3.6,Management of Rents Deposits,"In France, the parties are free to enter into any agreed terms regarding rental deposits. The terms of the deposit should explain what the deposit is expected to cover. For example, the rental deposit terms can provide that the rent, repairs, service charge, dilapidations and rates are covered. These terms could also be widely drafted to cover any liabilities owed by the tenant at the end of the tenancy. The amount of the deposit is, in part, regulated by the law which provides that the maximum amount of the deposit for unfurnished properties will be one month, with no maximum for furnished properties. The rent deposit paid at the beginning of the tenancy must be refunded at the end of the rental period. The landlord or their representative has one month to refund the security deposit if the final inventory is consistent with the initial inventory and if there is no outstanding rent or tax to be paid. This period may be extended to two months if there are differences between the initial and final inventories. The time frame to refund the deposit begins on the day the tenant returns the keys for the premises (in person or by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt). In the event the security deposit is not refunded, the outgoing tenant must send a formal demand to the landlord by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt. If, despite this action being taken, the landlord refuses to refund the security deposit, the tenant can refer the case to the regional mediation commission (Commission Départementale de Conciliation). If this mediation process proves unsuccessful, the tenant can then go before the small-claims court (juge de proximité) if the value of the claim is less than €4,000, or the district court (tribunal d’instance). If the amount of the security deposit exceeds €4,000, the tenant must send an assignation, which will be prepared and delivered by a bailiff to the landlord. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.17,Change of Control,60.17.1,,"The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Company has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under “Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; _provided_ _that Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount ----- thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture can be waived only with_ the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. ----- The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken, in reliance on a ratio-based basket including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, and such ratio- based basket is a “no worse than test”, (including clause (5)(B)(ii) of the second paragraph of this covenant), at the option of the Company, the applicable amount of indebtedness for each such financial ratio shall be increased pro forma and prior to the application of such test calculated as if all Permitted Indebtedness had been drawn in full (including clause (1)(B) of the second paragraph of this covenant). If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on, at the Company’s option, the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred, provided that notwithstanding anything in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Company may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the ----- relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness, and further provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) penalties, interest or hedging break costs, accrued and unpaid interest and any related stamp or other taxes, notarial, registration or similar fees and other fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitted such Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Any reference in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to an Applicable Metric shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date. ----- In relation to any action, matter or transaction (including an Investment or Permitted Acquisition) which would result in a cumulative increase to the Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group (in an amount determined by the Company by reference to the date of commitment thereto after giving pro _forma effect thereof and any adjustments permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) (each a_ “Qualifying Transaction”), from such date until the date on which the Quarterly Financial Statements for the first quarter end date falling immediately after completion (or as the case may be termination or abandonment) of that Qualifying Transaction are delivered to the Trustee, the Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA of the Group for the purposes of all baskets, fixed amounts, ratios and thresholds in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture which include a calculation by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA shall be increased (on a pro forma basis) by such amount. If the value of any of the baskets, fixed amounts, ratios or thresholds is subsequently decreased upon the delivery of the applicable Quarterly Financial Statements in respect of the financial quarter immediately following completion (or as the case may be termination or abandonment) of that Qualifying Transaction, any item undertaken or incurred in good faith prior to any decrease shall be grandfathered and shall continue to be permitted notwithstanding the subsequent reduction in the relevant baskets, fixed amounts, ratios or thresholds. For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year or calendar year (each an “Annual _Period”) (i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during_ such Annual Period may be increased by (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with the preceding clause (i), any usage of such basket during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) firstly against any Carry Forward Amount; (B) secondly against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with the preceding clause (i); and (C) thirdly against any Carry Back Amount. To the extent that any Indebtedness, Lien, distribution, payment or Investment or other transaction referred to in or contemplated by the definition of Applicable Test Date, satisfies any Applicable Metric, or other test or condition on the Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric, test or condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence or on any other date of determination under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and irrespective of any facts or circumstances (including financial condition) on any such date or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any basket with a fixed euro amount or based on a percentage of LTM EBITDA) (and such amount a “NonRatio Basket Amount”) on the same date as any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including, without limitation, any Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio and/or Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio) that requires compliance with any such financial ratio or test (any such amount a “Ratio Based Basket Amount”), it is understood and agreed that the Non-Ratio Basket Amount (and any cash proceeds thereof and any discharge of any Indebtedness with the proceeds thereof) shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to such incurrence of any Ratio Based Basket Amount. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon such declaration, such principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately; _provided, _however, that a Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section will_ not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clauses after receipt of such notice. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration to accelerate the Senior Secured Notes, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Senior Secured Notes (including the accrued and unpaid interest thereof) will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. A notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default set forth in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this covenant may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice or instruction. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to ----- the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Holders may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity, security and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security, indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; ----- (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of such satisfactory security, indemnity and/or prefunding; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Company is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Senior Secured Notes has occurred.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Additional Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).

Pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Company previously issued €400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior secured notes due 2028 (the “Existing Senior Secured Notes”) on March 25, 2021 (the “Original Issue Date”). The New Notes will constitute Additional Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), will have substantially the same terms and conditions as the Existing Senior Secured Notes (except as otherwise set forth herein, including with respect to the issue price, interest rate, issue date, redemption prices, call schedule and the date from which interest shall accrue) and will constitute a single class of securities with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for all purposes (unless otherwise indicated) under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, and offers to purchase. However, the New Notes will be issued as a separate series from the Existing Senior Secured Notes and will not be fungible with the Existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will be issued with separate ISINs and common codes from those assigned to the Existing Senior Secured Notes. See “Certain Tax Considerations— _Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences” Unless the context otherwise requires, for_ all purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to “Senior Secured Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Existing Senior Secured Notes issued on the Original Issue Date as well as any Additional Senior Secured Notes (including the New Notes). Additional Senior Secured Notes may be designated to be of the same series as a series of Senior Secured Notes, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such series of Senior Secured Notes, and shall be deemed to form one series and references to such series of Senior Secured Notes shall be deemed to include such Senior Secured Notes as well any such Additional Senior Secured Notes. The New Notes will constitute Additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the New Notes to (i) repay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) fund cash on balance sheet and (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined in “Summary—The Transactions”). The Senior Secured Notes Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to ----- understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor _Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._ This “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and your rights. The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are, or will be, subject to certain transfer restrictions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Additional Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a US holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such US holder’s method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and the Additional Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, US holders would be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of an Additional note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Additional Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. US holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Additional Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.1,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences,62.1.2,Payments of Stated Interest,"Payments of stated interest on an Additional Note (including additional amounts, if any, paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld, if any) generally will be includible in the gross income of a US holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the US holder’s regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. Interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the US foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the US dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. A cash basis US holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each interest accrual period (or portion thereof) equal to the US dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such accrual period (or portion thereof within the US holder’s taxable year) determined by translating such amount into US dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the accrual period (or portion thereof) (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the US holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual method US holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt ----- instruments held by the electing US holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the US holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the US dollar value of such payment, translated at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the US dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as US-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-US withholding tax paid (or deemed paid) by a US holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for US federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a US holder’s particular circumstances. US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.1,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences,62.1.3,Original Issue Discount,"The issue price of the Additional Notes may be less than their stated principal amount by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount ([1]/4 of 1 percent of the principal amount of the Additional Notes multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date) in which case the Additional Notes will be considered to have been issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for US federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID on an Additional Note generally will be equal to the excess of the Additional Note’s stated principal amount over its issue price. The “issue price” of an Additional Note generally will be equal to the first price at which a substantial amount of the Additional Notes are sold for money (not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). If an Additional Note is issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on the Additional Note, a US holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis, before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. The amount of OID includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Additional Note for each day during that taxable year on which the US holder holds the Additional Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an accrual period a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. An accrual period can be any length of time that is not longer than one year, provided that each scheduled payment of principal and interest occurs on either the first or last day of an accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period generally will equal (i) the product of the adjusted issue price of the Additional Note as of the beginning of such period and the Additional Note’s yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, less (ii) the stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of an Additional Note as of the beginning of any accrual period will equal its issue price, increased by any previously accrued OID and decreased by any payments other than stated interest. The “yield to maturity” of an Additional Note generally will be the discount rate that, when applied to all payments to be made under the Additional Note, produces a present value equal to the issue price of the Additional Note. The OID allocable to a final accrual period generally will be the difference between the amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. ----- A US holder will not be required to recognize any additional income upon the receipt of any cash payment on an Additional Note that is attributable to previously accrued OID, but such US holder may be required to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss, as described below. The accrual of OID on an Additional Note will be computed in the applicable foreign currency, and the amount of accrued OID determined for any accrual period will be translated into US dollars in the same manner as accrued stated interest on an Additional Note in the hands of a US holder. See “—Payments of Stated Interest” above. Upon receipt of a payment attributable to OID on an Additional Note (whether in connection with a payment on such Additional Note or the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of such Additional Note), a US holder generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar amount of the accrued OID as determined above and the US dollar value of such payment received in respect of such OID (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date of payment). Generally, any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense. All payments on an Additional Note generally will be viewed first as the payment of stated interest, second as the payment of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and thereafter as the payment of principal.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.1,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences,62.1.4,"Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Additional Notes","A US holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note generally will equal the cost of the Additional Note to the US holder, decreased by the aggregate amount of any payments (other than stated interest) on such Additional Note previously made to the US holder and increased by the amount of OID, if any, on such Additional Note previously included in income by the US holder. If a US holder uses foreign currency to purchase an Additional Note, the cost of the Additional Note will be the US dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase. The conversion of US dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase an Additional Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a US holder. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a US holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be includible in income as ordinary interest income in accordance with the US holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the US holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note for an amount of foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of that amount translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Additional Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual method taxpayer) will determine the US dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method US holder that cannot or does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the exchange rates on the trade date and settlement date. Holders will recognize currency gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates during the period in which the US holder held such Additional Notes. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will generally be equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the US holder’s purchase price of the Additional Note in foreign currency determined (1) using the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and (2) using the spot rate on the date the US holder acquired the Additional Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest (which will be treated as discussed ----- above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the US holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Additional Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for US foreign tax credit limitation purposes. All foreign currency gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not as an adjustment of interest income. Any gain or loss recognized by a US holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note will generally be US source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder has held the Additional Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of a non-corporate US holder (including an individual), any such gain may be eligible for preferential US federal income tax rates if the US holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

This discussion does not address the US federal income tax consequences for holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes. This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a US holder (as defined below). This discussion does not address the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax or the effects of any US federal tax laws other than US federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-US tax laws. No rulings from the US Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Additional Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, US expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, US holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (or investors in such entities or arrangements), persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Additional Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement and persons holding the Additional Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises discretionary authority or control over the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to the assets of an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering whether to invest the assets of any Plan in an Additional Note, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel to determine, among other things, whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing such Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to such Plan, including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control, conflict of interest and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. None of the company, the initial purchasers, any other party referred to in this Offering Memorandum or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is undertaking to act, or will undertake to act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to decisions as to an investment in the Additional Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decisions regarding an investment in the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,63,ERISA AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS,63.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,63.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving “plan assets” with persons or entities who are parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect thereto, unless an exemption is available. For example, an ERISA Plan is prohibited from lending money (or otherwise extending credit) to a party in interest or disqualified person, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and any fiduciary who authorizes such a transaction may be subject to personal liability, and any such transaction may need to be reversed or otherwise corrected. In addition, if the Plan involved in a non-exempt prohibited transaction is an IRA, the IRA could under certain circumstances lose its tax-exempt status. The acquisition and/or holding of an Additional Note by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the initial purchasers are considered to be a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative prohibited transaction exemption. ----- In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and holding of an Additional Note depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Additional Note and the relationship of the party in interest or the disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, relating to transactions effected by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, relating to investments by bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, relating to investments by life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23, relating to transactions directed by in-house asset managers. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide exemptions for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person with respect to that ERISA Plan (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that, directly or indirectly, has or exercises discretionary authority or control, or renders investment advice with respect to, the ERISA Plan assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that, in connection with the transaction, the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate consideration. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to all possible prohibited transactions that might occur in connection with an ERISA Plan’s investment in the Additional Notes or that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) that are subject to Similar Law may purchase or hold an Additional Note only in compliance with such Similar Law. Because of the foregoing, the Additional Notes offered hereby (and interests therein) should not be acquired or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of an Additional Note (or any interest therein) that is an ERISA Plan will be further deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Additional Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Additional Notes, and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Additional Notes. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the potential excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may be imposed on persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, ----- or other persons considering purchasing or holding an Additional Note (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to such investment and whether an exemption would be necessary and applicable to an investment in an Additional Note offered hereby. Each purchaser of an Additional Note (or any interest therein) has the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase, holding and subsequent disposition of an Additional Note offered hereby (or any interest therein), complies with the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws. The sale of any Additional Notes offered hereby to any Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Additional Notes. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Additional Notes from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Additional Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price of the Additional Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Additional Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United States-registered broker dealers. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Additional Notes in the United States, they will do so only through one or more US registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable US law. In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that: - the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Additional Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel; - during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 45 days after such date, none of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will, without the prior written consent of BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of or announce an intention to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided hereunder, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of their respective subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Additional Notes (other than the Additional Notes); and - the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Persons who purchase Additional Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may purchase a portion of the Additional Notes in the Offering. In addition, we have been informed that one or more of our directors, officers or members of our senior management may purchase Additional Notes in the Offering. The Additional Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Additional Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of Additional Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration ----- under the Securities Act. During this 40-day period, neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The Additional Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Additional Notes. In addition, the Additional Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Additional Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Additional Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market-making in the Additional Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Additional Notes, that you will be able to sell your Additional Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Additional Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Additional Notes. Syndicate-covering transactions involve purchases of the Additional Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions may cause the price of the Additional Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate-covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. It is expected that delivery of the Additional Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the        business day following the date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+       ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Additional Notes on the date of pricing or the next        business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Additional Notes initially will settle in T+      , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Additional Notes who wish to trade the Additional Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Additional Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Additional Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Guarantors. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Additional Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Additional Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Additional Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with ----- the Additional Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of Additional Notes. See “Notice to Certain Investors.” Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable, in the past and received fees in relation to arranging such loans. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its affiliates, as applicable, and may have from time to time in the past held, and may in the future hold, positions in our or any of our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general derivative transactions with us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses. In particular, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates, including the Senior Secured Notes (including the Additional Notes offered hereby) and the Senior Notes. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and thus may receive a portion of the proceeds from the Offering upon repayment thereof. In addition, Natixis and/or its respective affiliates is the facility agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Senior Secured Notes (including the Additional Notes offered hereby) and the Senior Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of such securities. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the group, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that: (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that face financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance; and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular, with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. In particular, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which: (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation; (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes); (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class; and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors, even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted, the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will, in ----- particular, ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing, and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive was implemented into French law by: (a) the issuance of ordinance n° 0221-1193 by the French government on September 15, 2021 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective from October 1, 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and (b) the issuance of decree n° 2021-1218 by the French government on September 23, 2021 (the “2021 Decree”) relating to the implementation of the 2021 Ordinance.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall apply only if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is, and will remain, located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A ----- to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States, so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a ----- court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened, that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. Following the entry into force of the Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a company’s COMI has shifted in the preceding three months the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the opening of secondary proceedings in another EU Member State—which will no longer be limited only to “winding up proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has an establishment in such EU Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings. ----- In the event that any one or more of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: (a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (i) insolvency practitioners and courts; (b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; (c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and (d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French ----- Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. The application of such grace periods cannot be excluded contractually. When a debtor is subject to conciliation proceedings, these statutory provisions shall be read in combination with Article L. 6117 of the French Commercial Code, pursuant to which the judge may impose grace periods on creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings.

These proceedings are confidential. The third party is appointed by the President of the competent commercial court upon proposal of the debtor company, but the discussions themselves are conducted outside the court; and (b) court-administered proceedings (procédures collectives), which are proceedings, during which payments by the debtor and legal actions by the creditors are suspended (automatic stay). These proceedings are public and involve all creditors. Within this second category, French law further distinguishes between: (i) safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings, which are voluntary proceedings and available to debtors that are facing difficulties they cannot overcome, but that are not insolvent (as defined below); and (ii) judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, which are mandatory proceedings and must be opened by debtors that are insolvent.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties (economic or financial) but are not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court and do not automatically involve any stay of the claims or pending proceedings. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the _mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints such person, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. The _mandataire ad hoc cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal, any agreement between the_ debtor and its main creditors (if any) will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat _ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings, and creditors are not barred_ from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims, but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. Conversely, Article L. 611-16 of the French Commercial Code provides, inter alia, that any contractual provision that affects the performance of an agreement by reducing the rights or increasing the obligations of a debtor solely as a result of the appointment of a mandataire _ad hoc will be deemed to be void. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. The ordinance of the court appointing the _mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for informational purposes to the debtor’s auditors. Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_ difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above), or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the president of the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure to statutory auditors if any and subject to the below) and may last up to five months, and do not automatically stay any pending proceedings, and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims, but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Conversely, Article L. 611-16 of the French Commercial Code provides, inter alia, that any contractual provision that affects the performance of an agreement by reducing the rights or increasing the obligations of a debtor solely as a result of the appointment of a conciliator will be deemed to be void. ----- Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period, in accordance with Article 13435 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim (suspendre l’exigibilité de sa créance). In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge. Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the _conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement._ The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the commercial court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened if: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern; and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition: (a) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential, except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court; (b) creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; (c) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off or rescheduled by a safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted), not even by a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed); ----- (d) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and (e) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test” above), and, therefore, the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below, see “—The “hardening _period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings”),_ cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the _conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à _l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_ (a) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; (b) the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained above; and (c) a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement, as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case, the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by any potential recoveries) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor’s business, in particular through a “plan for the sale of the business” (pre-pack _cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or_ judicial liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements, offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may, after consultation of the public prosecutor, be considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of_ the fees of the professional advisors retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself ----- entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor; in particular, it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment_ is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will distribute to its creditors (or submit to the classes of affected parties) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equityholders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the courtappointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise _ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission _d’assistance). A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed_ administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation _des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would become insolvent shortly after the safeguard proceedings should such proceedings come to an end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative and in all such cases with the exception of (i) (b) above where: (a) the court may act upon its own initiative; and (b) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard or judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial Restructuring Lien”): ----- (a) during the observation period in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the temporary continuation of business in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case financing must be authorized by the supervisory judge and be subject to publicity, or (b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan, benefit from a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims with the exception of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, (iv) pre-commencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) postcommencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee scheme under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code. The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to commencement of the proceedings. In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the supervisory judge can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are required to declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the debts that arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings (as well as the post-proceedings commencement non-privileged debts) and are prohibited from engaging individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment default in relation to such debts and the accrual of interest on loans with a term of less than one year, or on payments deferred for less than one year, is stopped. Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’ ordinary activities during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien). The manner in which the liabilities will be settled as provided for in the plan (debt remissions and payment terms) must be submitted to the creditors during a consultation, or if rejected on an individual basis, prior to the plan being approved by the court. Creditors (and if applicable, equityholders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equityswaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. ----- _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for_ commencement of the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover, or (y) €40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, _provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed_ creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors consulted in writing that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the courtappointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals_ that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the total amount of the debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. ----- If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps. _Class-based consultation: This applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for commencement_ of the proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (i) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover or (ii) €40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties _affectées), as defined below._ Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan. Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code, affected parties are: (a) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan; (b) equityholders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are modified by the proposed plan. The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes presenting a sufficient commonality of economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions: (a) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of the claims so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes; (b) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class; (c) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and (d) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account. ----- The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered certified accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust. Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the court-appointed administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the parties. The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien). The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equityholders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree. The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days. The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting a vote. If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at shareholders/equityholders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority. Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met: (a) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the aforementioned rules; (b) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated equally and in proportion to their claim or right; (c) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties; (d) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e., no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved); (e) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and (f) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected. ----- The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). _Cross-class cram-down: The 2021 Ordinance introduced a cross-class cram-down mechanism into_ French law. Where a safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties that voted against the plan provided that: (a) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; (b) the plan has been approved by: (i) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors’ class (créanciers chirographaires); or, if such condition is not met, (ii) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than: (A) an equity holders’ class; or (B) any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could not be reasonably expected to be entitled to any payment if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a courtordered sale plan (plan de cession)); (c) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e., absolute priority rule); (d) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its claims or interests; (e) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if: (i) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and €20 million of net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover; (ii) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); ----- (iii) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, pro rata their shareholding; and (iv) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of equity holders, The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes. Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption. As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to becoming insolvent in the near future. At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that: (f) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or (g) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met: (i) (i) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the order of payment in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan); and/or (ii) (ii) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such class(es) would not have received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or of a court-ordered sale plan), may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor. ----- In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed and, in judicial reorganization proceedings, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see “—Court_administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings” below)). _Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social_ security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called upon to vote on the proposed plan.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: (a) the debtor’s financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire _aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable);_ (b) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; (c) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough of the parties that will be impaired to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period, that may be extended up to a total of four months, following commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings upon request from the debtor and the courtappointed administrator; and (d) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings. The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors alone. If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditor classes (see above) to be formed, the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. ----- The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected parties party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization _or Liquidation Proceedings”)._",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Under the judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator appointed by the court will assist the debtor to make management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). As a result of the commencement of liquidation proceedings, the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of the management. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an_ observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. ----- There are differences by reference to safeguard proceedings that relate to class formation and the adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows: (a) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the courtappointed administrator on their own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); (b) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; (c) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void; (d) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide to apply the cross class cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in addition to the debtor or the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and (e) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails the approval of the plan may occur through the standard consultation rules (see above). In relation to equityholders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization proceedings: (a) in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote in order to ensure that the shareholders’ equity is at least equal to one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan; (b) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Commercial Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (b) the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: (i) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or ----- (ii) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession). At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: (a) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, also known as a sale plan (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the thirdparty purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: ----- (i) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; (ii) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and (iii) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Once more, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their going-concern market value; or (b) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (i) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only); (ii) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which unsolicited purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (iii) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure _des plis cachetés)._ If the court orders a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either: (a) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif); or (b) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: (a) when the benefit of the continuation of the liquidation procedure is disproportionate when compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or ----- (b) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court, such as: (a) automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside by the court if a claimant (such as an insolvency officer or the public prosecutor) so requests. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for indebtedness (including a security to secure a guarantee obligation) previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of professional receivables (Dailly _assignment) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date_ of insolvency), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration _d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code; and_ (b) transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.” There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard proceedings -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing _contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated_ January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the sale plan (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (a) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (b) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business); (c) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; (d) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; (e) creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: ----- (i) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (ii) to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (iii) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the European Union would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); (f) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code; and (g) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan de sauvegarde”) or of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”) adopted by the court. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des _annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled_ outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement nonprivileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors representative, are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. ----- In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors’ representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of managing the debtor, selling the assets of the debtor and settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset. As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor will be required. The mandataire judiciaire may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share capital.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition and a contractual financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering of the Additional Notes (including any additional Notes) which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has (i) applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each Guarantor and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that Guarantor through the intercompany loans, cash pooling arrangements or similar arrangements that are outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such Guarantor or (ii) used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to a Guarantor or its controlled subsidiaries through the intercompany loans or similar arrangements and that are, in each case, outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such Guarantor Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could subordinate or declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder that represent either (i) the amount of debt made available directly or indirectly to that Guarantor or its subsidiaries with the proceeds of Indebtedness previously incurred by a holding company of such Guarantor to the extent that such Indebtedness is or has been refinanced directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer constituting Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which term includes the Additional Notes offered hereby; and (ii) the amounts of the Additional Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such Guarantor, and the controlled subsidiaries of that Guarantor, under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. Any payment made by such Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Additional Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. The amount secured by any Senior Secured Notes Collateral which is granted by any such Guarantor (or any other guarantor which is incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the amount which it is so able to guarantee. In addition, if a Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’slength transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Additional Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Additional Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the ----- actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société _par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account_ pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement _de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent.

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers. ----- _Parallel Debt_ Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code, (which will be the case here for the Security Documents governed by French law). The holders of interests in the Additional Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Additional Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Additional Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. The holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral). Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation) has held (in a decision dated September 13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n° 10-_ 25.533 Belvédère) rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the French law concept of international public policy (ordre public _international), this decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France_ of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Additional Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Additional Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that become particularly important following default or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Additional Notes. _Trustee_ Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Trustee as trustee for the holders of the Additional Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and may therefore not directly be granted to holders of the Additional Notes. The concept of a “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the Belvédère decision referred to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified The Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the ----- Senior Secured Notes Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee. _Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French courts_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts. A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered. Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking pledge thereon. To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial securities account, and consequently, no assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Additional Notes or Senior Secured Notes Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event. _Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Pledges Over Receivables/Bank Accounts_ The pledges over receivables/bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over receivables/bank accounts. As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables/bank accounts of a company. Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank accounts from granting a second ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts, this structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The _action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such ----- legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, or the granting of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Additional Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Senior Secured Notes received with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,66,AVAILABLE INFORMATION,66.1,,66.1.1,,"Each purchaser of Additional Notes from the Initial Purchasers was furnished with a copy of this Offering Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving this Offering Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum was deemed to acknowledge that: (i) such person was afforded an opportunity to request from us, and to review and has received, all additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information herein; (ii) such person did not rely on any of the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with any of the Initial Purchasers in connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and (iii) except as provided pursuant to paragraph (i) above, no person was authorized to give any information or to make any representation concerning the Additional Notes or each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee offered hereby other than those contained herein and, if given or made, such other information or representation should not be relied upon as having been authorized by us or any of the Initial Purchasers. For so long as any of the Additional Notes are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, during any period in which it is neither subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor exempt from the reporting requirements under Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, make available to the holder or beneficial owner of such restricted securities or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted securities designated by such holder or beneficial owner, in each case upon the written request of such holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser, the information required to be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.1,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES France,27.1.1,,"The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or principal places of business in France. Most of the directors, officers and other executives of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of US courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of US federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Additional Notes against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, each Guarantor and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such US judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such US judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such US judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the US court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such US judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such US judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such US judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the US judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such US judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the US judgment will benefit from the _res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared_ enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. ----- 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative US action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the US authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative US action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of US federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France._ ----- To the Chairman, In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Emeria and further to your request in connection with a planned refinancing operation, we have reviewed the accompanying condensed interim consolidated  financial  statements  of  Emeria  for  the  nine-month  period  ended 30 September 2022. We note that as it is the first time that Emeria has prepared condensed interim consolidated financial statements at 30 September 2022, the information for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021 presented for comparison purposes has not been audited or reviewed. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Chairman. Our role is to express a conclusion on these condensed interim consolidated financial statements based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie _Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement. A review of interim_ financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed interim consolidated financial statements have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw your attention to Note 3.2.1 to the consolidated financial statements, which states that the condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by retrospectively applying as of 1 January 2021 the IFRS IC’s position concerning the recognition of the costs of configuring or customising a supplier’s application software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement. 3 l Emeria l Statutory Auditors’ review report on the condensed interim consolidated financial statements l For the nine-month period ended 30 September 2022 F-4 ----- This report has been prepared for the intended recipient only in the context described above. It may not be used, distributed or quoted for any other purpose. We do not accept any liability towards third parties to whom this report may be distributed or communicated. This report is governed by French law. The French courts have exclusive jurisdiction to rule on any dispute, claim or disagreement resulting from our engagement letter or this report, or on any matter related thereto. Each party irrevocably waives any right to lodge objections to action brought before these courts, to claim that the action was brought before a French court lacking jurisdiction or that the French courts lack jurisdiction.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIOD Changes in scope of consolidation,72.3.1,,"External growth investments (acquisitions) The period’s most significant acquisitions are described below. - **Acquisition of FirstPort in the UK On 18 August 2022, the Group completed the acquisition of a 100% stake in the UK’s FirstPort group from the investment fund Equistone, for a total purchase price of GBP 198.4 million (€228 million). With the largest acquisition in its 50-year history, Emeria is continuing to pursue its international growth strategy, adding the UK’s leading residential property services company (jointly owned property management) to its portfolio and becoming the world leader in its sector. FirstPort operates in England, Scotland and Wales. With more than 4,000 people, it had revenue of €130 million in 2021. FirstPort’s main activity is the management of jointly owned properties. At 30 September 2022, costs directly related to the acquisition (mainly due diligence, advisory and legal fees) were recognised in non-recurring operating income and expenses, for a total of GBP 5.4 million (€6.2 million). To finance the acquisition, the Group carried out a cash capital increase for €114.5 million subscribed by its ----- below). It should be noted that FirstPort’s borrowings and debt were repaid by the Group in full on the date of the acquisition, for a total amount of GBP 191.9 million. The unamortised issuance costs relating to the former borrowings and debt were expensed in full in the statement of profit and loss, for a total amount of €3.3 million. The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition was in progress at 30 September 2022. Based on the figures available at the acquisition date, provisional goodwill recognised in connection with the acquisition amounted to €446.2 million at 30 September 2022. - **Acquisition of Codabel (Benelux) In January 2022, Emeria Benelux completed the acquisition of Codabel and the property management business of Cushman & Wakefield Asset Services Belgium, for a total amount of €19.7 million. With the addition of Trevi Corporate, Esset Benelux will manage a portfolio of 1.6 million square metres. The acquisition propels the Group to the number three spot in Belgium’s professional property management market, behind BNP Paribas and CBRE. The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition was still in progress at 30 September 2022. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with the acquisition amounted to €16 million at 30 September 2022. - **Acquisition of Optima (Germany) In March 2022, the Group completed the acquisition of Germany’s Optima group, for €23.6 million. Berlin-based Optima was founded in 1993 and is a major player in the German property management market. With 400 employees, it manages nearly 33,000 residential and commercial units and had €21.8 million in revenue in 2021. This acquisition is one of the biggest transactions in the German property management market in recent years. Postacquisition, Reanovo manages around 150,000 residential units and has almost 1,300 employees. The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition was still in progress at 30 September 2022. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with the acquisition amounted to €20.3 million at 30 September 2022. - **Acquisition of Billon (France) On 31 May 2022, the Group completed the acquisition of the real estate division of the Lyon-based Billon group, for a net amount of €109.5 million. Billon, a family-owned group founded in 1870, is active in both property management and transactions. With 230 employees in 14 local offices in and around Lyon, as well as in the Var and Alpes-Maritimes départements, Billon had revenue of €25.8 million in 2021. The acquisition of this key industry player has further reinforced Foncia’s already deep foothold in the region. At 30 September 2022, the Billon group was not included in the scope of consolidation. The Group’s investment is included in other non-current financial assets. ----- Overview of the number of legal structures in the consolidation scope",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,72,V** **- NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,72.7,Efficity,72.7.1,,"In 2022, the Group negotiated agreements with the founders and certain key individuals, replacing the previous agreements signed between Emeria and Foncia Saturne in 2018. - **Description of the transaction As a reminder, to secure the founders’ commitment to Efficity’s future development, in 2018 the Group entered into an agreement using a specific legal structure based on an intermediate holding company (Foncia Saturne) controlling Efficity’s entire share capital. At the time, the founders subscribed to a capital increase carried out by the holding company in an amount of €4 million, with the possibility of realising a potential capital gain on the subsequent resale of their shares to Emeria, depending on trends in the company’s EBITDA. In accordance with the Group’s objective of retaining exclusive control upon completion of the transaction, Efficity continued to be fully consolidated. The estimated cost of purchasing the managers’ shares in Efficity was treated as a profit-sharing arrangement intended as consideration for services rendered. Accordingly, the cost was spread over the term of the transaction, as from 2018. At 31 December 2021, an earn-out liability of €53.9 million was recognised in other current liabilities, with the offsetting entry recognised gradually in non-recurring operating income and expenses. In May 2022, further to a wish to develop its relationship with the founders and key individuals, the Group altered the shareholding structure as described below: - In accordance with the previous agreements, Emeria Europe exercised its call option (valued based on the company’s performance to date) to acquire the remaining Foncia Saturne shares for a total amount of €69.8 million, including: - €4.7 million paid in cash at closing; - €42.6 million paid to the founders in the form of a vendor loan to be settled by the Group by April 2023 (shown as an earn-out liability within other current liabilities); - €22.5 million reinvested by the founders and key individuals (i) in Efficity (€20 million) and (ii) in Efficity International (€2.5 million). |Analysis of scope of consolidation at 30 Sept. 2022|Change (10)| |---|---| |30 Sept. 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Full consolidation 359 369|| |Of which acquisitions Of which newly created companies Of which mergers and asset contributions (“TUP”) Equity method 1 1|27 1 (38)| |Total – France 360 370|(10)| |Full consolidation 180 82|98| |Of which acquisitions Of which newly created companies Of which mergers and asset contributions (“TUP”)|102 4 (8)| |Total – International 180 82|98| |Total – Consolidated entities 540 452|88| ----- - New shareholder agreements were set up with key individuals and the founders at the level of Efficity and Efficity International. They include call and put options on shares with exercise periods between 2025 and 2028. The exercise price is dependent on revenue and EBITDA trends over those periods. - Following the transaction, the shareholding structure (through Foncia Saturne) breaks down as follows: - 88.21% of Efficity’s share capital is held by Emeria and 11.79% by the founders and key individuals; - 51% of Efficity International’s share capital is held by Emeria and 49% by the founders and key individuals. - **Accounting treatment of new shareholder agreements _Consolidation method_ The shareholder agreements signed in 2022 are a continuation of the 2018 transaction. Their provisions are very similar and the changes in the governance requirements confirm the Group’s control over the companies. Furthermore, the Group considers that the exercise price of the options does not deprive it of the returns associated with owning the shares and therefore that a “present ownership interest” exists. Accordingly, the Group has continued to fully consolidate the companies’ shares. As a result, no non-controlling interests in respect of Efficity and Efficity International appear in the statement of financial position (the shares in these companies are shown in liabilities). _Treatment of call and put options on shares_ Since the Group considers that the 2022 agreements were signed as a continuation of the 2018 agreements and that, in substance, they result in a proposal to the founders and key individuals to defer part of the amounts due to them in return for their involvement in the company, with the possibility of being able to benefit from any upside on the option exercise date, the reciprocal calls and puts were not analysed in light of IFRS 3. The amendment to the payment terms does not call into question the nature of the payment, but instead offers the key individuals and founders a profit-sharing mechanism linked to the future growth of the business. The same reasoning applies to the lower value Efficity International options. On this basis, the Group concluded that the payments represented employee benefits as defined by IAS 19, requiring recognition as an expense against an employee-related payable. However, as the exercise of the put options is not strictly contingent on the continuing presence of the founders or key individuals within the Group, Emeria considers that the estimated cost of purchasing the shares cannot be recognised over the term of the transaction. Accordingly, the Group recognised the entire expense in full as soon as the agreements were set up. _Summary of impacts at 30 September 2022_ - Consolidated statement of financial position: - Vendor loan: shown as an employee-related payable within other current liabilities for €42.6 million. - Put option granted to the founders and key individuals: shown as an employee-related payable within other current liabilities for €50 million, calculated on the basis of the best estimates and information available at the date of preparation of the interim financial statements. - Consolidated statement of profit and loss: - Settlement of the 2018 transaction: non-recurring operating expense of €15.8 million corresponding to the difference between the total purchase price of the Foncia Saturne shares (€69.8 million) and the payable provisioned at 31 December 2021 (€53.9 million). - 2022 shareholder agreement: non-recurring operating expense of €27.5 million corresponding to the difference between the estimated overall cost of purchasing Efficity and Efficity International shares (€50 million) and the reinvestment made by the founders and key individuals (€22.5 million). - Consolidated statement of cash flows: €7 million payment to key individuals to purchase their shares in Foncia Saturne, shown on the change in working capital requirement line, net of their €2.3 million reinvestment in Efficity and Efficity International (i.e., a net cash outflow of €4.7 million). -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

As part of the financing for the FirstPort acquisition, in August 2022 the Group also drew down a new €346 million tranche of its Senior Facility B, bearing interest at 3-month Euribor + 4.5% and maturing in March 2028. The costs associated with the new borrowings totalled €13.2 million and were classified as a reduction in borrowings and debt.

The premium paid on the instruments is shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows within other financial items. The instruments protect the Group against an increase in the three-month Euribor rate above 1% on a cumulative nominal amount of €1,148 million until 25 December 2024. In view of the hike in interbank rates begun in January 2022, the fair value of the instruments represented €44.5 million at 30 September 2022. Effectiveness tests confirm the eligibility of the instruments for cash flow hedge (CFH) accounting. Accordingly, the change in the fair value of the instruments was recognised in other comprehensive income for €41.3  million  excluding  deferred  tax  (€30.9  million  including  the  deferred  tax  impact)  at 30 September 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The IFRS IC agenda decision confirmed that in most cases, pursuant to IAS 38, these costs should be recognised as an expense and not as an intangible asset, because (i) the entity does not control the software and (ii) the customisation/configuration activities do not create a resource controlled by the customer that is separate from the software. These costs should therefore be expensed: - either when they are incurred if the developments are carried out internally or by a third-party supplier (unrelated to the SaaS solution publisher); - or over the term of the SaaS contract if the developments are carried out by the publisher of the SaaS solution or by its subcontractor. Analyses conducted by the Group confirmed that configuration and customisation costs for certain SaaS software historically carried within assets (mainly in respect of the Workday software used as the Finance and HR ERP since 2019) did not meet the criteria outlined in the IFRS IC’s agenda decision and should, therefore, be expensed. In accordance with IAS 8 and in the absence of any transitional provisions to the contrary, any changes resulting from a final agenda decision issued by the IFRS IC are retrospectively applicable. The impact of this change in accounting policy was recognised in the statement of financial position retrospectively as of 1 January 2021, resulting in a €10 million decrease in non-current assets and a corresponding €7.4 million decrease in consolidated equity (net of tax).

With a view to discontinuing the cumbersome and non-scalable Thetrawin software, _Millénium_ was developed to ensure and enrich all critical functionalities for the property management business (accounting records for client accounts; management of suspense accounts, jointly owned properties and rentals; management of jointly owned property association budgets, etc.). The project was led by the teams of Emeria Technologies, the legal entity responsible for the Group’s digital development and innovation. Most of the costs directly related to the project have been capitalised since 2018, with the exception of some overhead and desktop publishing costs which have been expensed. At 31 December 2021, total costs recognised within intangible assets in progress amounted to €51 million. They include two fairly distinct modules: ML Transaction and ML Property Management. Given the structure of the project and its actual deployment, separate go-live dates have been selected by the Group: - from 1 January 2022 for the Transaction module: as from 1 January 2022, the key functionalities of ML Transaction are available (put into production), allowing the module to be used in the conditions initially intended. Amortisation also started on the same date; - from 30 September 2022 for the Property Management module: go-live was assessed based on two objective parameters: (i) the functional coverage rate of Millénium compared to Thetrawin and (ii) the capacity of the infrastructure to support the use of the applications in all branches. The Group considers the two criteria to have been met on 30 September 2022, allowing for the module’s widespread deployment and its amortisation as from that date. The go-live of the modules is presented as a reclassification between intangible assets in progress and software, for a total amount of €66 million, divided between the two modules as follows: - ML Transaction: €14 million; ----- - ML Property Management: €52 million. Both the Transaction and Property Management modules will be amortised over a period of 10 years, as from their respective go-live dates.

However, given the highly volatile economic environment since the beginning of 2022 and, in particular, the hike in interest rates (and hence actuarial rates), the Group decided that it was necessary to recognise all resulting actuarial gains and losses within other comprehensive income (equity). Accordingly, Mercer (France) and eActuary (Switzerland) re-calculated the amounts at 31 December 2021 based on new assumptions, and projected the liability for retirement benefits and long-service awards over nine months. The actuarial gains and losses generated over the period were then calculated as the difference compared to the calculations based on the prior assumptions. Assumptions: - Discount rate: - France: 3.75%, versus 1% at 31 December 2021/Switzerland: 2%, versus 0.3% at 31 December 2021. - Rate of increase in salaries: - France: unchanged at 1%/Switzerland: 1.5%, versus 1% at 31 December 2021. - The other assumptions (employee turnover, payroll taxes, etc.) were not adjusted.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Revenue generated in France increased by 9.1% (or €66.7 million), owing primarily to the property management business (up 8.5%, or €42.9 million): - revenue from rental management activities increased by 5.5% (or €13.3 million) due to a positive volume effect (the number of properties managed increased by 3.8%) as well as an increase in prices; - rental income decreased due to lower volumes resulting from a weak market (gradual decline in the turnover rate); - revenue from joint property management increased by 10.8% (or €26.3 million), mainly due to a positive volume effect (the number of units managed increased by 9.1%). The transactions business grew by 7.1% (or €8.4 million), mainly owing to the acquisition of AGDA, the leading player in Grenoble, and a favourable volume/price mix, whereas sales fell by 5.7% in a more downbeat market environment. The digital business grew by 11.6% (or €9.3 million), driven by the good performance of Efficity (up 15.4%), which recruited more than 490 professionals over the last 12 months despite a tougher market environment. Revenue from the B2B business grew by €6.2 million compared to the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021, mainly on account of acquisition-led growth and new contracts signed. In the international business, revenue grew by €35.7 million, with all countries reporting gains, mainly thanks to acquisitions. In Switzerland, business for the first nine months of 2021 had been negatively impacted by restrictions related to the Covid-19 crisis. In Germany, redundancies in 2021 as a result of Covid-19 led to a loss of customers. |Activity|Reclassified from|Reclassified to| |---|---|---| |Constatimmo|Other activities|Property Management| |Optissimmo|Digital business|Property Management| |Tech-Way|Other activities|Property Management| |Assurimo|Other activities|Digital business| |Seiitra|Other activities|Digital business| |Prowen|Other activities|Property Management| -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Acquisition-led growth was mainly driven by the property administration (administration de biens, hereafter referred to as property management) business in France, but also by B2B and international operations. The year’s most significant acquisitions are described below (all of which were consolidated during the year): - **Acquisition of the IPF group (Property management, South-East France): On 1 April 2021, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the IPF group for a total amount of €29.9 million. IPF is engaged in rental management, property transactions, lettings and activities relating to jointly owned property associations (its core business) in the Marseille region. The group has 26 subsidiaries and generated revenue of €15.3 million in 2019. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with this acquisition amounted to €33.5 million at 31 December 2021. - **Acquisition of the Valexim group (Property management, North-East France): On 31 May 2021, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Financière de Maistre Bayard (Valexim) for €43.2 million. Located in the Alps region, this group has 13 subsidiaries and is predominantly engaged in property management activities (2019 revenue: €22.1 million). This acquisition is part of the drive to develop the business in the Savoie and HauteSavoie regions. Together with its other acquisitions, the Group now has a significant market share and is becoming a key player in both regions. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with this acquisition amounted to €48 million at 31 December 2021. - **Acquisition of the Quenot group (Property management, Ile-de-France region): On 30 June 2021, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the Quenot group for €24 million. This group is located to the east of Paris and had revenue of €7.1 million in 2019, mainly from its property management business. Provisional  goodwill  recognised  in  connection  with  this  acquisition  amounted  to  €19.5 million  at 31 December 2021. - **Acquisition of the Immo de Corse group (Property management, South-East France): On 1 July 2021, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the Immo de Corse group, the leading manager of jointly owned properties on the Corsican market, for €16.8 million. This independent group comprises five entities and had revenue of €6.9 million in 2020. Its innovative organisation (centralised back office) enables it to generate very high FTE/property ratios. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with this acquisition amounted to €11.5 million at 31 December 2021. - **Acquisition of the Agda group: On 31 December 2021, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the Agda group for a provisional purchase consideration of €67.7 million. Based in Grenoble, Agda comprises 27 companies and is among the 10 leading managers of jointly owned properties in France (€31 million in revenue). Provisional  goodwill  recognised  in  connection  with  this  acquisition  amounted  to  €86.8 million  at 31 December 2021. - **Acquisition of Humakey (B2B): On 31 July 2021, the Group acquired Humakey for €14.4 million. In just a few years, Humakey has succeeded in establishing itself on the B2B market as the premium player in property management. Humakey is currently the only company to offer a truly bespoke service to its clients for strategic real estate assets, in return for high fees. This acquisition allows Esset to round out its range of services with an upscale offer that meets client demands in this niche market. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with this acquisition amounted to €8.7 million at 31 December 2021. - **Acquisition of Intercity in Switzerland: On 31 May 2021, DBS Holding acquired 50% of the share capital of Zurich- based Intercity Bewirtschaftung AG for a provisional purchase consideration of CHF 6.6 million. The Intercity group operates in five German-speaking Swiss cities and generated sales of CHF 10.3 million in 2019. This acquisition will enable the Group to become the leading property management company in German-speaking Switzerland. ----- As part of this transaction, reciprocal call and put options were set up with the seller on the remaining 50% of the shares: - Call: option for DBS to buy back the remaining 50% of the shares (unconditionally exercisable from 1 January 2023, with early exercise of the option permitted in certain cases). - Put: option for the seller to sell the remaining 50% of the shares to DBS (in principle unconditionally from 1 January 2022, with early exercise of the option permitted in certain cases). At 31 December 2021, these options were valued at €6.4 million and recognised in net debt (see Note 4.11.) against goodwill. Intercity was fully consolidated during the year in light of the degree of control exercised over this entity within the meaning of IFRS 10 and the Group’s ability to contribute in substance to power over this entity. Given the Group has rights to returns under its call option, Intercity was consolidated on the basis of a 100% interest as from the time of its acquisition. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with this acquisition amounted to €11 million at 31 December 2021. - **Acquisition of the R&M group in Germany: On 31 August 2021, the Group acquired the R&M group through Brillant 3586 GmbH (a subsidiary of Foncia Deutschland GmbH & Co KG) for a provisional purchase consideration of €10.4 million. With offices in Dresden and Leipzig in eastern Germany, R&M employs around 180 people and generated revenue of around €9.5 million in 2020. This acquisition marks a further step in the Group’s acquisition-led growth strategy and its aim to become a leading player on the real estate services market across Europe. Provisional goodwill recognised in connection with this acquisition amounted to €10 million at 31 December 2021. The process of identifying the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of all of the above-mentioned acquisitions was still in progress at 31 December 2021.

On 29 June 2018, Foncia signed an amendment to the agreement for the loan granted by Foncia Groupe to its subsidiary Foncia Switzerland, eliminating all repayment clauses. Given that no repayments have been made and that no repayment plan has been set for the foreseeable future, this loan is considered as a monetary item and as part of the net investment in Foncia Switzerland as quasi-equity, in accordance with IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.

Since the vast majority of local transactions are carried out in Swiss francs, this risk is not material. It should be noted that Foncia signed an amendment to the agreement for the loan granted by Foncia Groupe to its subsidiary Foncia Switzerland on 29 June 2018, eliminating all repayment clauses. Given that no repayments have been made and that no repayment plan has been set for the foreseeable future, this loan is now considered as a monetary item and as part of the net investment in Foncia Switzerland as quasi-equity, in accordance with IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Since this date, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the loan have been included in other comprehensive income (equity) under foreign currency translation reserves. |Col1|CHF thousands| |---|---| |Assets|444,620| |Liabilities|325,064| |Net position before hedging|119,556| |Forex hedging|0| |Net position after hedging|119,556| |Currency value|0.9680| |Net position after hedging (equivalent value in € thousands)|115,725| -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits. It is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following assessments that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in our audit of the consolidated financial statements. The Group tests goodwill and assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis, in accordance with the methods presented in Notes 3.4.5. “Impairment of assets” and 4.1.2 “2021impairment tests” to the consolidated financial statements. We examined the methods used by the Group to test for impairment, together with the cash flow forecasts and assumptions relied upon for that purpose. We further verified that the notes provide appropriate disclosures. As part of our assessments, we also ensured that the estimates used were reasonable. These assessments were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company’s management. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also: - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements; -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Besides the payment of the dividend, the new borrowings will be used to finance acquisitions in an amount of €98.2 million. More specifically, the Group arranged a seven-year, €1.275 billion term loan B, with two bond issues completing the transaction: an issue of seven-year senior secured notes for €400 million and an issue of eight-year senior unsecured notes for €250 million. A revolving credit facility (RCF) was also set up for a total amount of €437.5 million. The main financial terms and conditions of these new borrowings are set out in Note 4.11.3. From both a quantitative and qualitative perspective, since this refinancing operation entails substantial modifications to loan terms, the original debt is extinguished and a new liability recognised. The unamortised issuance costs relating to the original debt were expensed in full in the statement of profit and loss at 25 March 2021 for a total amount of €15.3 million (see Note 5.9). Issuance costs on the new borrowings totalled €39.8 million, of which €0.5 million relates to the cost of early repayment of the original debt. These new issuance costs were classified as a reduction in debt in an amount of €39.3 million, and will be recognised over the term of the borrowings by adjusting the effective interest rate.

The amendment allows lessees granted rent-free periods or rent reductions directly related to the Covid-19 to recognise them directly in the statement of profit and loss. It has no material impact on the Group’s financial statements. - Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IFRS 7 (phase 2) – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform These amendments, adopted on 13 January 2021, are applicable as of 1 January 2021. The reform of interest rate benchmarks led to the elimination of interbank rates, including Eonia and certain LIBOR rates, as of 1 January 2022, and their replacement as of that date. Most of the Group’s debt and derivatives contracts are indexed to 3-month Euribor. Consequently, the reform does not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. ----- In the first half of 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) issued several agenda decisions, including: - Final IFRS IC agenda decision on the attribution of benefit to periods of service In May 2021, the IASB endorsed the conclusions of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) dated December 2020 regarding the basis for calculating the period of service to which an entity attributes benefit for a particular defined benefit plan. According to these conclusions, entities should consider periods of benefit entitlement and caps on those periods when recognising benefit obligations. Whereas the approach most commonly used in France was to recognise benefit obligations on a straight-line basis from the date the employee in question joined the entity to the date of their retirement, the IFRS IC considers that benefit obligations should only be recognised on a straight-line basis over the number of years of employee service immediately before the retirement age, and that said years of service should be capped. The Group took this  new  approach  into  account  when  measuring  its  employee  benefit  obligations  at 31 December 2021. In accordance with IAS 8 and in the absence of any transitional provisions to the contrary, any changes resulting from a final agenda decision issued by the IFRS IC are retrospectively applicable. The impact of this change in accounting policy was recognised in the statement of financial position retrospectively as of 1 January 2020, resulting in a €3.5 million decrease in the provision for retirement benefits and a corresponding €2.2 million increase in consolidated equity (net of tax). The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 were also restated retrospectively to reflect the application of this agenda decision.

This question had been raised due to the variety of observed practices. The IFRS IC agenda decision confirms that in most cases, pursuant to IAS 38, these costs should be recognised as an expense and not as an intangible asset, because (i) the entity does not control the software and (ii) the customisation/configuration activities do not create a resource controlled by the customer that is separate from the software. These costs should therefore be expensed: - either when they are incurred if the developments are carried out internally or by a third-party supplier (unrelated to the SaaS solution publisher); - or over the term of the SaaS contract if the developments are carried out by the publisher of the SaaS solution or by its subcontractor. The Group’s review of this agenda decision brought to light various technical issues in terms of the analysis of the possible components of an SaaS project requiring the assistance of the IT department, and certain operational difficulties in collecting data with the necessary level of detail to understand the expenses incurred. Given the complexity of the analyses to be performed, this decision has not been applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. Similarly, the 2020 consolidated financial statements were not restated for this decision. The Group is currently analysing the contracts that may be affected by the decision.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

These estimates serve as the basis for measuring the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that cannot be obtained directly from other sources. The estimates made by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial statements are based on a going concern assumption and relate primarily to the items described below. - Recoverable amount of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment The estimates and assumptions made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment relate mainly to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Note 4.1.2 sets out the assumptions used to calculate future cash flows and determine the discount rates to be applied in measuring the recoverable amounts of these assets. Sensitivity analyses were also performed and are described in the same note. - Measurement of leases IFRS 16 requires entities to use certain key estimates, which include:  whether an option to extend or terminate a lease is reasonably certain to be exercised;  the lease term;  the appropriate discount rate to be used to calculate future lease payments;  the specific selling price of any lease components and non-lease components contained in the contract. The main assumptions used by the Group to prepare its 2021 financial statements are described in Note 4.4.3. - Measurement of assets and liabilities relating to post-employment plans The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Obligations under these plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which is based on assumptions regarding the discount rate, future increases in salary, employee turnover, life expectancy and the rate of increase in healthcare costs. Note 4.12 sets out the assumptions used to measure these obligations. The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the current environment. However, the corresponding obligations may change if these assumptions also change. - Basis for determining the value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination The estimates and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of these identifiable assets and liabilities relate in particular to the market outlook used to estimate future cash flows and determine the discount rates used. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the recoverable amount. In the absence of IFRS guidance for a specific transaction, event or condition, the Group uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that will result in relevant, fair and comparable information to ensure that the financial statements:  present a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows;  reflect the economic substance of transactions;  are neutral, prudent and comprehensive in all material respects.

Controlled entities Companies directly or indirectly controlled by the Group are fully consolidated. Control exists when the Group is exposed to risks or is entitled to variable returns from its involvement with the entity in question and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Control is analysed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the inputs used to assess control has changed. A subsidiary is consolidated as from the date control is acquired, which is usually upon signature of the share transfer and disposal agreements (see “Accounting for ongoing acquisitions” below). Consolidation ceases when control is relinquished. Any interest in the subsidiary that is not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group is recognised within noncontrolling interests. Profits and losses and each component of other comprehensive income relating to subsidiaries are allocated to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Changes in the percentage interest held in subsidiaries that do not lead to a change in control are treated as equity transactions, since the transactions take place between owners acting in their capacity as owners. The impact of these transactions is shown in equity net of tax and does not therefore impact consolidated profit or loss. These transactions are also shown in the statement of cash flows under cash flows relating to investing activities. Investments in equity-accounted companies (associates and joint ventures) Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity without controlling or jointly controlling those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to its net assets. Joint control of an arrangement only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Profits, losses, assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s interest in the profits, losses and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures is applied in order to determine whether the Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures need to be tested for impairment. Where necessary, the total carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets. ----- Acquisitions in progress or carried out late in the year Before acquiring shares in a property management company, the Group agrees to acquire the shares and typically pays 10% of the estimated price to the seller. This part payment is included in “Downpayments on acquisitions of securities” within non-current financial assets (see Note 4.5). The remaining 90% is booked under off-balance sheet commitments (see Note 8). Note that at this point in the transaction, the Group does not yet have control over the entity being acquired. Upon signing the share transfer or disposal agreement, the Group pays an additional 70% of the estimated price to the seller. The provisional purchase price is then included in equity investments, and the part payment already recognised is also reclassified to this caption. The acquired company is then consolidated. Following a review of the acquired company’s financial statements, the Group pays the remaining balance and adjusts the purchase price of the shares. In the case of acquisitions completed late in the year (generally in November or December), even though the acquired companies may be controlled by the Group, they may not be consolidated until the following year, due to insufficient accounting information being available. The investment made is therefore temporarily carried in non-current financial assets at its acquisition cost (i.e., representing the fair value of the investment). The shares are included in “Investments in controlled companies pending consolidation” (see Note 4.5.). No other statement of financial position or profit and loss item is recorded. Non-consolidated investments Companies with the following characteristics are not included in the scope of consolidation: - they are in the process of being wound up or are dormant; - their business is not strategic for the Group. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-consolidated investments are carried at fair value through other comprehensive income.

Functional currency and translation of the financial statements of foreign companies A consolidated entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the local currency. However, certain entities must adopt a functional currency other than their local currency when that currency represents the currency of the major transactions carried out by the entity and accurately reflects its economic environment. The financial statements of foreign entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are translated using the “closing rate” method, as follows: - assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate; ----- - statement of profit and loss and cash flow items are converted at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting currency translation differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income within equity under “Translation adjustments”. Goodwill relating to foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro are treated as assets acquired or liabilities assumed and therefore translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. As the Group does most of its business in the eurozone, only its Swiss subsidiaries prepare financial statements in a currency other than the euro. The following exchange rates were used to prepare the consolidated financial statements: 2021 2020 Equivalent to €1 Closing rate Average rate Opening rate Closing rate Average rate Opening rate EUR (Euro) 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 GBP (Pound sterling) 0.8403 0.8595 N/A N/A N/A N/A CHF (Swiss franc) 1.0331 1.0812 1.0802 1.0802 1.0705 1.0952 The exchange rates used are the rates published by the Banque de France. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedged rate. At the end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the closing exchange rate, with the resulting gains and losses included in foreign exchange gains and losses under other financial income and expenses in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined. Loans granted to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in that foreign operation. Translation adjustments arising on monetary items that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (equity) under “Foreign currency translation reserves”, and taken to profit or loss when the net investment is sold.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,75,"TOTAL ASSETS** **341,828",75.19,3.4.1.** **Business combinations and goodwill,75.19.1,,"The Group uses the purchase method to account for its acquisitions of subsidiaries. The fair value of the consideration transferred reflects the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed or incurred by the acquirer at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed in the period in which they were incurred. On the first-time consolidation of a subsidiary or equity investment, the Group measures all identifiable items acquired at their acquisition-date fair value. The items are measured in the currency of the acquired company. In the event of deferred settlements, the future amounts payable are discounted to present value at the settlement date. The discount rate used is the same as that used to estimate the value of the assets. Fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities resulting from business combinations accounted for on a provisional basis (i.e., because the independent appraisals or ongoing additional analyses are incomplete) are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within 12 months of the acquisition (measurement period) and if ----- they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. Adjustments made after the measurement period are taken directly to profit or loss, unless they are made to correct an error, including in relation to deferred tax assets which, if recognised more than 12 months after the acquisition date, generate tax income. Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of “Investments in equity-accounted companies”. Goodwill The residual difference representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interests in the acquired company over the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as goodwill. For each business combination, the Group may choose to account for non-controlling interests: - either at acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of goodwill on the non-controlling interests (“full goodwill” method); - or based on the share of net identifiable assets of the acquired entity measured at fair value, in which case goodwill is only recognised on the portion attributable to owners of the parent (“partial goodwill” method). Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is evidence that it may be impaired. The impairment testing approach is described in Note 3.4.5 “Impairment of assets” below. Impairment recognised against goodwill may not be reversed. Bargain purchases When the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired company exceeds the purchase price plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company, the negative goodwill is taken immediately to profit or loss in the period of the acquisition, after verifying the procedure for identifying and measuring the various items included in its calculation. Transactions involving non-controlling interests Changes in non-controlling interests that do not result in gain or loss of control are recognised in equity. In particular, when additional shares are acquired in an entity already controlled by the Group, the difference between the purchase price of the shares and the additional share of consolidated equity acquired is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the parent. The consolidated carrying amount of the subsidiary’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including goodwill) remains unchanged. Contingent consideration and/or earn-out Contingent consideration or earn-outs relating to a business combination are measured at their acquisition-date fair value, even if it is deemed unlikely they will be paid. After the acquisition date, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration/earn-outs result in an adjustment to goodwill only if they are made within the 12 months following the acquisition date (measurement period) and if they result from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. In all other cases, any such changes are taken to profit or loss, unless the consideration transferred is an equity instrument. The revised IFRS 3 gives certain indications as regards the accounting for contingent payment arrangements with employees or selling shareholders. These arrangements may be part of the business combination or may be considered as separate from the acquisition agreement for the target entity. In certain acquisitions, earn-out payments were considered part of the consideration for post-acquisition services rendered and are therefore expensed in the periods concerned and in future periods. ----- Business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisitions) In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss on the date control was obtained. Goodwill at the date control is obtained is calculated as the fair value of consideration transferred (i.e., price paid) plus the fair value of the Group’s previously-held equity interest in the acquired company. Put options granted to non-controlling interests As part of certain transactions, the Group may put in place options contracts regarding consolidated investments. These may be call, puts or even reciprocal options, which may or not be contingent on certain conditions. Analysing these options contracts is often complex and requires a good understanding of the economics of the transaction carried out, along with the substance of the commitments binding the different categories of shareholder concerned. Options are therefore accounted for on a case-by-case basis in light of all known facts and circumstances. In granting a put option to non-controlling interests, the Group sells those non-controlling interests an option under which they can sell their shares. The non-controlling interests can exercise their put option, thereby requiring the Group to purchase the underlying shares at a specified exercise price and future date. In the absence of specific guidance from IFRS, these options are accounted for by the Group as follows:  the present value of the commitment at the reporting date is included within “Liabilities relating to put options on non-controlling interests”;  the corresponding non-controlling interests are cancelled. This accounting method does not affect the presentation of non-controlling interests in the statement of profit and loss. Pending completion of the work in progress at the IASB and IFRS IC, and in accordance with the recommendations of the French financial markets authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers – AMF) for companies preparing 2009 financial statements, subsequent changes in the value of the commitment are recognised in full by means of an adjustment to equity. When the put option is exercised, the Group derecognises the liability in respect of the deferred payment against the amount of cash effectively paid to the non-controlling interests.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Its leases are of many different types, but are mainly leases of property or vehicles. Pursuant to IFRS 16 – Leases, on entering into a contract, the Group analyses the contractual provisions to determine whether it has the characteristics of a lease. It verifies whether the lease transfers in substance the right to control the use of an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. If these characteristics exist, as soon as the asset is made available the Group recognises: - a right-of-use asset, which represents its right to use the leased asset over the lease term; - a lease liability (“IFRS 16 lease liability”), which represents the present value of its obligation to make lease payments. The Group applies the same method to account for all leases in which it acts as lessee, and has chosen not to use the practical expedients set out in IFRS 16 exempting short-term leases (i.e., leases with terms of 12 months or less) or leases of low-value underlying assets from the scope of the standard. The amount of the right-of-use asset comprises: - the amount of the associated lease liability; - plus:  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,  any initial direct costs incurred to obtain the lease,  any estimated restoration costs to be incurred by the Group; - less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. They are depreciated over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset for accounting purposes, whichever is shorter. The lease liability represents the present value of: - fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; ----- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; penalties required for terminating the lease. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. To determine the lease term, the Group analyses the contractual provisions of the lease, as illustrated below: Term The Group remeasures the lease liability (and adjusts the corresponding right-of-use asset accordingly), when: there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate; there is a change in the lease contract (lease modification) that is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. When the Group incurs a material obligation to restore the asset to the condition specified in the lease contract, the related costs are included as part of the cost of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability is increased accordingly.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

This is notably the case for German subsidiary Vegis (acquisition carried out in January 2020), which sub-lets – mostly to students – accommodation which the company itself has leased. IFRS 16 first requires the contract to be identified as a sub-letting arrangement in accordance with provisions applicable to lessors, and then to determine whether that arrangement is a finance lease or an operating lease. Classification as a finance lease or an operating lease is based on the right-of-use asset obtained under the initial lease, and not on the underlying asset. To determine whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease, the Group performs an broad analysis to determine whether the contract transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards inherent to ownership of the leased asset to its client (the lessee). ----- To perform this analysis, the Group determines whether: (i) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the client by the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset, and (iii) the present value of the lease payments amounts to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. This will then determine the accounting treatment applicable to the initial lease and to any sub-letting income. The asset recorded in respect of the initial lease is not derecognised and continues to be depreciated. Lease payments collected from the lessee in the sub-letting arrangement are taken to revenue. Based on their contractual characteristics, all of the Group’s sub-letting arrangements meet the definition of an operating lease within the meaning of IFRS 16.

Cash-generating units For the purposes of these impairment tests, non-current assets that cannot be tested individually for impairment as they do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, are grouped into cash-generating units (CGUs). Impairment tests are carried out on each CGU or group of CGUs at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets for internal management purposes. The CGUs identified by the Group correspond to its major development and investment strategies. The Group has defined the following three cash-generating units: - Property Management France CGU, which includes the management of jointly owned properties, rental management, lettings, the transactions business and client mandates; - Property Management International CGU, which includes the property management and transactions businesses in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium; - Group of Services CGUs, which includes Constatimmo (brokerage for technical surveys), Assurimo (insurance brokerage), Efficity (property appraisals website), FPM and Esset Management (B2B property management), Prowen (brokerage specialised in energy purchases), Seiitra (property management software development), Tech-way (technical maintenance) and Lodgis (furnished rentals). The Group decides whether or not to recognise an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities in a CGU or group of CGUs with their recoverable amount. ----- Impairment indicators External indicators of impairment include changes in the general economic and financial environment, downtrends in local economic environments and changes in economic performance. These are analysed by the Group to determine whether the assets concerned should be tested for impairment more frequently. Method used to determine the recoverable amount An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of: - its fair value less the costs of disposal, representing the amount at which the Group could sell the asset (after selling costs) in an arm’s length transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and - its value in use, representing the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use and ultimate sale of an asset or CGU based on the most probable assumptions adopted by management. Fair value net of the costs of disposal is calculated based on available information used to establish the best estimate of the selling price net of costs to sell in an arm’s length transaction between fully informed, consenting parties. Value in use of CGUs or groups of CGUs is determined based on post-tax cash flows resulting from business plans and a terminal value calculated by extrapolating data for the last year of the business plan. The assumptions used are based on the budgets and business plans prepared by management for each business. These budgets are the latest budgets approved at the date of preparation of the financial statements. Other assumptions affecting the calculation of the recoverable amount include the growth rate, operating margin, the discount rate and the tax rate (see Note 4.1.2). The discount rate used to discount post-tax cash flows to their present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Where there is no specific discount rate for the assets tested, the average cost of capital is used. The discount rates are post-tax rates and are applied to post-tax cash flows. The recoverable amount calculated using post-tax discount rates is equal to that which would have been obtained using pre-tax rates applied to pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

IFRS 9 applies a single analytical framework to all financial assets in order to determine the classification and basis of measurement to be used for accounting purposes. More specifically:  **Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets that will be recovered through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) are generally carried at amortised cost. Financial assets at amortised cost include operating financial assets, other loans and receivables and trade receivables. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest rate method. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets at amortised cost are written down by the amount of any expected credit losses. Impairment losses relating to commercial receivables are recognised in recurring operating profit items, while those relating to other financial assets are recognised in financial expenses.  **Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income reclassifiable to profit or loss Financial assets that will be recovered both through repayments of contractual cash flows (i.e., repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) and through sales of those assets are generally carried at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, with the exception of interest income and dividends, which are included in other financial income and expenses. Changes in fair value are reclassified to profit or loss when the assets are sold.  **Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income This category includes downpayments to equity investments and investments in non-consolidated companies, and equity instruments that the Group has irrevocably elected to classify in this category. When these investments are sold, the unrealised gains and losses previously carried in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss; only dividends will be taken to profit or loss. Fair value corresponds to the market price for listed securities or to the estimated fair value for unlisted securities, as determined according to the financial criteria most appropriate to the particular situation of each investment. The fair value of equity investments whose price is not quoted on an active market is determined based on the latest known transactions involving these investments.  **Assets at fair value through profit or loss All other debt and equity instruments are carried at fair value through profit or loss. These include marketable securities with an underlying term of more than three months, other financial assets held for trading and purchased for sale in the near term, and financial instruments with a positive fair value that are not eligible for hedge accounting.

Provisions may also be recognised for contingent liabilities arising on business combinations. In this case, they are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. When the Group expects partial or full repayment of the provision, for example owing to an insurance policy, the repayment is booked as a separate asset but only if such repayment is virtually certain. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision reflects the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligations, as calculated using a pre-tax discount rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and, where applicable, the risks specific to the liability. Since provisions are calculated based on estimated future contingencies and expenses, they are measured taking into account the assumptions deemed most probable at the reporting date. Items giving rise to provisions (trade and employee disputes, etc.) are reviewed regularly to allow for any adjustments. Provisions include amounts accrued in respect of business, employee-related and/or tax (excluding income tax) risks and disputes arising in the ordinary course of operations, as described below:  Employee-related provisions (disputes, lay-offs, etc.) At the end of each reporting period, a provision is recognised and adjusted in line with the risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Human Resources department on a case-by-case basis.  Provisions for rent payment guarantees A rent payment guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Emeria with the management of their property. Emeria bears the cost of any unpaid rent and advances to owners. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and therefore represent a risk of non-recovery. Rent payment guarantees are incidental to the property management contracts (deriving from the del credere agreement) and are accounted for as follows: - the related fees are recorded continuously in income over the period of the mandate, since they are deducted from rents in the same way as basic fees; - once rent is reported as unpaid, a provision is recorded, calculated in accordance with IAS 37. ----- The amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis and regularly updated).  Provision for occupancy guarantees An occupancy guarantee is offered to lessors who have entrusted Emeria with the management of their property. The provision for occupancy guarantees is calculated on a statistical basis by reference to the probable residual vacant period for properties currently vacant and subject to occupancy guarantees. The provision is estimated based on the firm’s average monthly rent. The maximum term of claims is 180 days.  Provision for URSSAF social security audits This concerns in-progress and completed URSSAF social security audits. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the related risk exposure, as assessed by the Group’s Payroll department on a case-by-case basis.  Provisions for risks on client accounts Provisions for risks on client accounts are designed to cover the non-collection risk on lost client accounts in debit, as well as other risks on client accounts. A provision is booked and adjusted at the end of each reporting period in line with the risk exposure on client accounts, as assessed by the Group’s Client Operations department on a case-by-case basis.  Provisions for third party and professional liability These provisions are recorded based on information provided by senior managers in charge of monitoring claims against their firm. The Audit, Legal and Accounting departments have the final decision in terms of whether or not to record a provision. If the claim is reported and covered by the liability insurance, the maximum provision will reflect the amount of the deductible (€15,000 as of 1 January 2014) or the amount of the estimated risk, whichever is lower. If the claim is not reported, the senior manager concerned sets the amount to be provisioned.  Provisions for other disputes These provisions are intended to cover disputes, litigation and other foreseeable contingencies in connection with the Group’s businesses, along with miscellaneous contingencies and expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

In connection with this appointment, the Group granted a long-term incentive plan with the following terms and conditions:  Grant date: 1 June 2020.  Reference period: 2 January 2020 to 31 December 2025.  Performance conditions: LTIP = % performance x equity value, with: (i) Equity value = Enterprise value - cash investments made in connection with acquisitions during the reference period. (ii) Enterprise value = 10 x increase in EBITDA during the reference period. (iii) % performance = progressive rate (between 3% and 5%) based on revenue earned in 2025. In accordance with IFRS 2, the service cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period against an employee-related payable. The fair value of this liability will be remeasured at each reporting date until the liability is settled, based on assumptions used in the budget. In 2021, the cost of this incentive plan represented €0.9 million, and is shown in non-recurring operating items.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,75,"TOTAL ASSETS** **341,828",75.44,Pensions and other post-employment benefits,75.44.1,," Short-term benefits Short-term benefits include paid annual leave, paid sick leave, bonuses and other benefits (other than contract termination benefits), expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period during which the employee services are rendered. Short-term benefits are expensed in the period in which the corresponding services are rendered by the employee. Any amounts not paid at the end of the reporting period are carried in current liabilities.  Post-employment benefits In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which the Group operates, Emeria participates in, or operates, benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Virtually all of the Group’s employees are entitled to pension benefits. In France, this takes the form of payments by the Emeria Group to the beneficiaries when the rights allotted vest, while in Switzerland, plans are managed by pension funds financed in compliance with the applicable government requirements and regulations. These plans may be funded by investments in various instruments such as insurance policies, equity instruments and bonds. Post-employment benefits are measured and recognised by the Group in accordance with IAS 19 – Employee Benefits, as described below. - Defined contribution plans Defined contribution plans and multi-employer plans are expensed as incurred in the statement of profit and loss based on contributions. - Defined benefit plans The cost of defined benefit plans is measured on an actuarial basis. The related obligations are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on the agreements in effect in each company. ----- Obligations are determined by reference to assumptions that are revised each year and relate for example to length of service, life expectancy, salary inflation and employee turnover, and also take into account macroeconomic assumptions for the various countries in which the Group does business (e.g., discount rate and inflation rate). The assumptions used for 2021 are detailed in Note 4.12. A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position for the difference between the related projected benefit obligation (actuarial liability) and any plan assets as measured at fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses. If plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation recognised, a non-current asset is recorded for the amount of the plans in the consolidated statement of financial position. A funding surplus (net defined benefit asset) is only recognised in the statement of financial position if its represents future economic benefits that will actually be available to the Group. When the calculation of the net benefit obligation gives rise to an asset for the Group, the amount recognised as an asset cannot exceed the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the plan or future reductions in contributions to the plan. Expenses under defined benefit plans comprise three components, accounted for as described below: - Service cost is recognised under personnel costs within operating profit. It includes service cost for the period, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments, which are recognised in full in profit or loss for the period in which they arose, and gains and losses arising on plan settlements. - Interest cost is recognised in other financial income and expenses and reflects the impact of discounting the obligations, net of the expected return on plan assets as measured using the discount rate applied to calculate those obligations. - Remeasurements of the net liability (or net asset) are included in other comprehensive income not reclassifiable to profit or loss, and do not impact the statement of profit and loss. They essentially comprise actuarial gains and losses, i.e., changes in the benefit obligation and in plan assets attributable to changes in assumptions and experience adjustments. Experience adjustments represent the difference between the expected impact of certain actuarial assumptions applied to previous measurements of the obligation and actual experience.  Other long-term benefits Other long-term benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19. The estimated cost of these benefits is recognised within non-current liabilities over the employees’ qualifying years of service. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs attributable to amendments to an existing plan or the introduction of a new plan are taken immediately to profit or loss. In France, the collective bargaining agreement for the real estate industry stipulates that all active employees who so request are entitled to one month’s salary at every anniversary date: after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of professional experience. Professional experience is considered overall and not as experience solely within the Group. However, the Group is only liable for the amount proportionate to the employee’s seniority in the Group. The Group’s obligation under long-service awards is assessed each year by an independent expert. The assumptions used for 2021 are detailed in Note 4.12. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Deferred tax does not arise on: - the initial recognition of goodwill; - the initial recognition of an asset in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting profit (loss) nor taxable profit (loss); - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, to the extent that it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Tax on items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income, respectively, and not in the statement of profit and loss. Deferred tax assets arising on temporary differences (after offsetting against deferred tax liabilities) or on tax losses and tax credits carried forward are only recognised to the extent that it is probable they will reverse and that the Group will generate future taxable earnings against which they can be utilised pursuant to local tax laws. The following are taken into account when assessing the Group’s ability to recover these assets: - forecasts of future taxable earnings; - taxable earnings in previous years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. IFRS 13 sets out a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value: - Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., price-based inputs). - Level 3: inputs relating to the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). ----- The Group primarily uses fair value on a recurring basis in its statement of financial position to measure derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, cash management financial assets and identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination.

IFRS 5 requires assets held for sale to be presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial position for the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell, provided that they meet the definition of assets held for sale set out in the standard. When the Group is engaged in a sale process resulting in the loss of control of a subsidiary, the entire assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, regardless of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the subsidiary after the sale. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. The assets and liabilities concerned are reclassified in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, and no offsetting is permitted. Businesses held for sale or discontinued are presented on a separate line in the statement of profit and loss for the periods presented, which shows post-tax profit or loss attributable to discontinued operations and the post-tax gain or loss on the disposal or the measurement to fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups comprising the business sold or in the process of sale. Operations that are abandoned or discontinued are defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major line of business and meets the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale or has been sold by the Group. Similarly, cash flows attributable to abandoned or discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the periods presented. Under IFRS 5, profits or losses related to discontinued operations are also to be shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of profit and loss, retrospectively for all periods presented. A discontinued operation can be defined as a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and: - represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; - is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and rebates, VAT and other taxes and duties. In accordance with IFRS 15, the Group recognises revenue when the amount thereof can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, and specific criteria are met by each of the Group’s businesses.  **Jointly owned property management business From a contractual and legal perspective, the Group’s jointly owned property management business is mostly conducted through mandates, and fees are calculated on a flat-rate basis. In France, this flat rate includes all basic management services provided by the jointly owned property association, and excludes incidental services such as: - preparing, convening and organising General Meetings; - managing the joint owners’ council; - managing the financial operations and keeping the accounts of the jointly owned property association; - managing the jointly owned property in compliance with its rules and regulations; - carrying out periodic visits and inspections of the jointly owned property. All such services are treated as an overall performance obligation satisfied over time. In fact, these different services are associated with a single performance obligation, i.e., management of the jointly owned property association. Annual revenue from basic property management fees is therefore recognised on a straight-line basis over the period during which the services are provided. Incidental services may be added to the basic management services and are invoiced based on an agreed rate for each such service, for example, additional meetings and visits, rules and regulations of the jointly owned property, physical and administrative management of claims, technical work and surveys, litigation and disputes. Since each additional service represents a separate performance obligation, revenue is recognised when the service is performed.  **Rental management business In its rental management business, the Group acts as agent for owners-lessors and fulfils a certain number of contractually defined obligations in this regard. These mainly concern: - routine management services, for example, rent reviews and collection, annual adjustment invoice for expenses, sending of rent receipts to lessees, and deposits; - other one-off management services, including preparation of the lease contract, inventory of premises, compilation of documentation, management of claims, administrative filings, and requests for subsidies; - technical management services, such as on-site repairs, mandatory technical surveys, and preparation of essential information documents for lessees; - insurance against unpaid rent; - other insurance such as for vacant premises or property damage. These represent separate service obligations. Accordingly, revenue for each of these obligations is recognised separately. Revenue from services provided over time, such as routine management services and insurance (falling outside the scope of IFRS 4) is recognised on a straight-line basis by reference to the frequency with which expenses are rebilled to the owners. Revenue from one-off services is recognised when those services are provided. -----  **Lettings Revenue is recognised at the time the inventory of the premises is conducted.

However, the carrying amount does not include that of identified liabilities. In 2018, goodwill of €1,094.9 million arising on the acquisition of a controlling interest in Emeria Holding (formerly Foncia Holding) in September 2016 was allocated pro rata to the enterprise value of each CGU, as estimated based on the acquisition business plans for each CGU used within the scope of the purchase price accounting.

The financial forecasts used in the impairment tests carried out at 31 December 2021 were prepared by management and cover a period of five years. They provide a consolidated view as well as a breakdown by CGU. It should be noted that all holding company expenses not allocated in the consolidated business plan were allocated in full to the Property Management France CGU. Corporate functions are managed at individual country-level for the Property Management International CGU and are considered not material for the Services CGU. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), calculated based on a sample of comparable European companies. A WACC was estimated for each foreign country and then calculated for the Emeria Group as a whole by weighting the cash flows of the French (Property Management France and Services CGUs) and ###### international (Property Management International CGU) operations. On this basis, a single post-IFRS 16 weighted discount rate of 7.1% was used for all of the Group’s CGUs. By way of reminder, a single pre-IFRS 16 weighted discount rate of 8% had been used for all of the Group’s CGUs in 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

As a reminder, the long-term growth rate used for the 2020 tests was also 2%. Finally, in order to take into account the impact of IFRS 16 on flows forecasts in the business plan and in particular estimate the future renewal of leases, the average age of the leases at 30 September 2021 and their useful life by asset class were used. A normative age per asset class was then determined in order to calculate a normative right-ofuse asset level. Renewal expenses relating to right-of-use assets in the business plan flows have therefore been captured in order to converge to the normative right-of-use asset level. Results of impairment tests Based on the impairment tests carried out, the value in use of each CGU exceeds the CGU’s carrying amount and as a result, no impairment needed to be recognised against the Group’s assets at 31 December 2021.

The Group also estimated the value of the Brolliet trademark at CHF 13.7 million (i.e., €13.3 million at 31 December 2021), as well as the Lodgis, Gribi and Office des Propriétaires trademarks, at €2.3 million, €2.9 million and €1.9 million, respectively. Concessions, patents and software Concessions, patents and software mainly relate to IT investments made by the Group. At 31 December 2021, the carrying amount of this caption represents €33.4 million and the main contributors are Seiitra for €16 million, Emeria Europe for €11.4 million and Switzerland for €2.6 million. The investments made during the period (€4.7 million) mainly concern Seiitra (€3.2 million) for the upgraded Thetrawin modules (Powimo project), Switzerland (€0.9 million) and Germany (€0.4 million). Other changes amounting to €13.8 million chiefly concern the capitalisation of assets in progress by Emeria Europe (ongoing IT projects) and Seiitra (Powimo project). Client relationships Client relationships include the fair value of the mandates held by Group companies, initially valued during the September 2016 purchase price accounting (PPA) process and then during the PPAs for significant acquisitions made since that date. These client relationships had a total carrying amount of €444.7 million at 31 December 2021, following the valuation over the period of client relationships taken on as a result of the significant acquisitions made in 2020 and 2021 for a total of €84.4 million (including those relating to the IPF group for €12.8 million, Gérance de Passy for €12.1 million, Loft One for €11.4 million and Quenot for €8.3 million). Client relationships also include portfolios acquired since September 2016 as part of the Group’s acquisition-led growth strategy (jointly owned properties and managed rental properties), representing a total amount of €17.1 million. Investments in the period amounting to €6.1 million mainly concern the Gerancimmo portfolio for €2.1 million and Quenot (brokerage) for €1.2 million. ----- ###### Other intangible assets Other intangible assets essentially comprise the cost of acquiring new business. The €5.3 million increase in this item during the period reflects the capitalisation of the costs of acquiring new mandates, rebilled to other firms in the network. Decreases totalling €1.5 million relate to the retirement of these costs for lots that were not secured in the period. Intangible assets in progress Intangible assets in progress include various Group projects that can be capitalised. At 31 December 2021, the main contributors are Emeria Technologies for €52 million, Emeria Europe for €23.2 million and Seiitra for €4.2 million. Investments made during the period for a total amount of €37.8 million mainly concern Emeria Technologies for €18.7 million (Millénium), Emeria Europe for €13.1 million (mainly IT investments) and Seiitra for €2.8 million.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

These contracts are managed using a dynamic approach directly in line with the operating performance of the Group’s branch network and its real estate strategy. In France, around 998 property leases were included in this caption at 31 December 2021 (789 property leases at 31 December 2020), of which around 47% are automatically renewable. The main leases (in terms of rent) relate to the head office at Antony, Foncia Paris Rive Droite at 27 rue de Provence in Paris, Esset Management in Aubervilliers, Foncia Paris Rive Gauche at rue Raymond Losserand and Boulevard de Courcelles in Paris. Changes in the period can be explained as follows: ➢ new leases in France for €14.3 million, concerning a total of 133 new contracts; ➢ changes in the scope of consolidation, concerning 122 property leases taken on from the various companies acquired in the period, notably Loft One (€5.4 million) and the OP group in Belgium (€1.1 million). As a reminder, in May 2020 the Group signed a framework agreement with BNP Paribas for the lease of Apple equipment. In 2021, this agreement resulted in a €3 million increase in right-of-use assets. The project will be gradually rolled out over the next few years, with the roll-out slated for completion by the end of 2025. Finally, it should be noted that the renewal of the Arval car fleet has been pushed back to the first half of 2022. At 31 December 2021, the vehicles fleet consisted of 1,221 vehicles on the road. In total, only 188 leases were taken out over 2021, mainly at Emeria Europe, Yxime and in Switzerland. |Remeasurements, Change in Right-of-use assets Depreciation/ Translation 31 Dec. 2020 New leases Retirements modifications and scope of Other changes (€ thousands) impairment adjustments terminations consolidation Property leases 203,443 21,467 10,485 26,994 1,007 (3,025) Leasehold rights 10,990 10 (302) 1,091 (2,376) Vehicles 10,030 2,252 (691) 685 115 (2,174) Photocopiers 5,190 988 350 334 36 (1,748) IT equipment 3,526 2,972 1 (5) Other property, plant and equipment 331 Gross value 233,510 27,688 (302) 10,144 29,105 1,158 (9,328) Property leases (65,064) (45,720) 4,697 (1,052) (403) 4,993 Leasehold rights (115) Vehicles (6,026) (3,183) 40 (74) 2,183 Photocopiers (2,183) (2,589) 60 1 (25) 1,749 IT equipment (800) (2,200) 4 Other property, plant and equipment (111) (110) Accumulated depreciation/impairment (74,298) (53,803) 4,796 (1,051) (502) 8,929|31 Dec. 2021| |---|---| ||260,371 9,413 10,217 5,148 6,494 331| ||291,974| ||(102,551) (115) (7,061) (2,987) (2,996) (221)| ||(115,930)| ||| |Right-of-use assets, net 159,212 27,688 (302) (53,803) 14,940 28,053 656 (399) Of which property leases 138,379 21,467 (45,720) 15,181 25,943 605 1,968 France 117,553 14,275 (37,247) 11,279 20,556 1,947 Switzerland 10,027 4,144 (3,737) 2,036 540 605 0 Germany 9,715 2,498 (3,968) 1,489 3,525 21 Benelux 1,084 550 (768) 378 1,322 (0) Of which leasehold rights 10,875 10 (302) 1,091 (2,376) Of which vehicles 4,004 2,252 (3,183) (651) 685 41 9 France 3,162 1,259 (2,024) (1,036) 115 (0) Switzerland 415 615 (520) 236 105 41 Germany 427 223 (483) 236 9 Benelux 155 (156) (87) 464 0 Of which photocopiers 3,007 988 (2,589) 409 335 11 1 Of which IT equipment 2,726 2,972 (2,200) 1 (1) Of which other property, plant and equipment 220 (110)|176,044 157,820 128,361 13,615 13,279 2,566 9,298 3,157 1,476 893 412 376 2,161 3,498 110| |Right-of-use assets, net 159,212 27,688 (302) (53,803) 14,940 28,053 656 (399)|176,044| -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

A single reasonably certain term of three years is used to measure these leases. This estimate takes into account (i) the need for the business to continue operating which acts as an incentive to continue the initial lease, but also (ii) the Group’s strongly proactive and opportunistic real estate strategy in streamlining its property portfolio (notably during restructuring operations resulting from its acquisitions).  Under IFRS 16, the discount rate for each lease is to be determined by reference to the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. In practice, given how the Group is organised financially, i.e., held or guaranteed almost exclusively by the three French holding companies, the Group adopted an incremental borrowing rate for all of its lease contracts (excluding vehicle leases), reflecting the Group’s own borrowing rate. Initially set at 3.25%, this rate was raised to 3.55% on 25 March 2021 following the Group’s debt refinancing operation. This new rate is therefore taken into account in valuing all leases from this date. The incremental borrowing rate corresponds to the sum of the risk-free rate and the Group’s credit spread over the life of the syndicated loan, without considering the term. The value of the vehicle fleet in France is estimated based on the interest rate implicit in the leases, as supplied by Arval, i.e., 2.56%. With regard to the other main assumptions and practical expedients: ######  The practical expedient exempting low-value or short-term leases has not been adopted by the Group.  Leases previously classified as finance leases under IAS 17 were classified as finance leases at 1 January 2019. To simplify, the residual useful life of these leases is calculated in the same way as under IAS 17. At 31 December 2021, there are no more IAS 17 leases.  Restoration costs: - Property leases: restoration costs are only calculated for major new leases, since it is difficult to reliably estimate such costs for all of the Group’s leases, as they are frequently negotiated with the lessor at the end of the lease. - Vehicle fleet: In France, the Group adopted an average cost of €700 per vehicle (cost plus 20% for private vehicles on which VAT cannot be recovered) in measuring the right-of-use asset corresponding to the residual value guarantee. This average cost was calculated based on a market estimate and taking into account the historical cost actually incurred when changing the automotive fleet at the beginning of 2019.  Deferred tax is recognised on the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability falling within the scope of IFRS 16, in a similar way to that previously recognised for finance leases.  Services provided in relation to the lease are included in the calculation of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on a case-by-case basis and by category of underlying asset. In particular, for the lease contract with BNP Paribas concerning Apple IT equipment, the Group has chosen not to separate the lease components from the service components, and therefore to consider all payments as relating to the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities must be calculated for both leases of equipment and for any services component. It should be noted that the Group was not concerned by any lease concessions in the period. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

As a reminder, the significant increase in other current receivables in 2020 was due to outstanding intra-group transactions. Thanks to the resolution of the technical difficulties encountered in Workday, intra-group settlements could be processed as from the second half of 2021. The change in CICE tax receivables (€8 million decrease) is mainly attributable to the partial reconstitution of the 2017 CICE tax receivable for €2 million due to due to it being over-used to pay 2020 income tax, and to the subsequent collection of the full amount for €9.5 million. This change also includes the partial use of the 2018 CICE tax receivable for €0.8 million to pay the four 2021 income tax instalments for the tax consolidation group. Note also that a 2018 CICE tax receivable was taken on from Loft One. Current accounts receivable at 31 December 2021 relate mainly to financing granted by the Group to companies in the process of being acquired and therefore not consolidated. In 2020, the outstanding amount included €12.6 million in current account advances granted to Loft One for the repayment of its bank debt. Other miscellaneous receivables include outstanding purchase consideration for €7.8 million. This item also includes receivables relating to the Assurance Privilège product for €2 million, and advances linked to client accounting (jointly owned properties and managed properties) for €1.4 million.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

This exercise highlighted the need to revise the historical deferred tax assets recognised, in particular the tax assets generated in connection with cancellations in the statutory financial statements of goodwill (fonds de commerce) arising from acquisitions. The Group’s historical practice was to record a deferred tax asset on consolidation entries in connection with business combinations, in order to neutralise the goodwill recognised in the statutory financial statements. At 31 December 2020, the Group recognised €70.4 million of deferred tax assets on its statement of financial position linked to the neutralisation of goodwill, of which €5.5 million related to goodwill acquired between 2011 and 2016. For tax purposes, these items of goodwill are deductible if they are part of a divestment strategy pursued by the Group. As the Group does not intend to make similar divestments in the near future, the question is whether it is appropriate to maintain these deferred tax assets on the statement of financial position at their historical value. |Adjustment of Changes Changes recognised deferred taxes Deferred taxes 31 Dec. 2020 recognised through other Translation Change in scope Allocation of arising on the Other changes (€ thousands) (restated) through profit or comprehensive adjustments of consolidation goodwill neutralisation of loss income goodwill On temporary differences 5,633 794 (1,468) On tax and harmonisation adjustments (3,581) (537) (1,064) ( 54) 5,480 On elimination of intra-group gains and losses (605) (156) 1 (41) On restatement of employee benefit obligations 5,651 427 (588) 99 292 27 Capitalisation of tax loss carryforwards 5,376 (737) 28 Capitalisation of financial expenses 7,881 4,170 carried forward On IFRS fair value adjustments 154 329 On effective interest rate adjustments ( 65) (71) On remeasurement adjustments (100%) ( 158,466) 8,305 (212) (22,190) (48,858) On other adjustments 25,432 (1,079) 7 1,583 (70,404) 44,779 Net deferred tax position (112,589) 11,446 (588) (1,169) 1,850 (70,404) (22,190) (82) Deferred tax assets 51,710 7,412 (588) 158 1,684 (70,404) 42,189 Deferred tax liabilities 164,299 (4,034) 0 1,327 (166) 22,190 42,271|31 Dec. 2021| |---|---| ||4,959 246 (801) 5,908 4,667 12,051 483 (136) (221,420) 317 (193,726) 32,161 225,888| |Net deferred tax position (112,589) 11,446 (588) (1,169) 1,850 (70,404) (22,190) (82)|(193,726)| ----- Since these tax assets were recognised as part of business combinations within the meaning of IFRS 3, they were recorded against a reduction in goodwill. As a result, the assets were written down against a revaluation of the goodwill amounts calculated and recognised in the context of these acquisitions. The write-down of these tax assets in 2021 therefore resulted in: - a decrease of €70.4 million in deferred taxes; - an increase of €6.9 million in equity, reflecting the adjustment of the impact of the change in tax rate in 2018 and recognised at that time through the statement of profit and loss; - a resulting €77.3 million increase in goodwill (see Note 4.1).

From an accounting and tax perspective, these fees had been included in the value of Emeria Europe shares at Emeria Holding and deducted over a period of five years through the recognition of a tax-regulated provision. The fees in question had been reclassified to profit and loss in consolidation in accordance with IFRS 3, and a deferred tax asset recognised. This reclassification is designed to offset this deferred tax asset against the deferred tax liability arising on the neutralisation of the tax-regulated provision. - Deferred tax assets recognised in the statement of financial position up to 31 December 2020 in respect of the neutralisation of goodwill acquired as a result of external growth transactions. These deferred tax assets had been partly offset against deferred tax liabilities arising on remeasurement adjustments. Accordingly, they were reclassified in deferred taxes arising on other adjustments before being adjusted for a total amount of €70.4 million, mainly against goodwill (see above).

This tax loss has been recognised in full in view of the high probability that sufficient future taxable profit will exist against which it can be utilised. - Proprietary tax losses of consolidated companies (arising prior to joining the tax consolidation group): €30.3 million, of which €28.8 million not recognised due to the improbability that sufficient future taxable earnings will be available against which the losses could be utilised (of which Emeria Holding for €8.9 million, IDHA for €4.8 million, Syndic for €2.8 million, Bourgeois Immobilier for €2.7 million and Axium Développement et Participations for €1.8 million). At 31 December 2021, deferred tax assets recognised in respect of tax loss carry-forwards concern tax consolidation arrangements (€3 million), proprietary tax losses of companies in the tax consolidation group (€0.4 million), Yxime (€1.1 million) and Efficity (€0.3 million). Capitalisation of non-deducted financial expenses Additional deferred tax assets of €4.2 million were recognised during the year in respect of the tax consolidation interest carried forward for 2021 under ATAD I tax rules. As in 2019 and 2020, these deferred taxes were charged against the taxable temporary difference arising from the indefinite-lived Foncia trademark. Deferred taxes on remeasurement adjustments Deferred tax liabilities on remeasurement adjustments relate to the deferred tax on the Emeria (formerly Foncia Management) purchase price accounting (PPA) process in September 2016, as well as on trademarks and client relationships recognised since that date on significant acquisitions carried out by the Group. The €22.2 million change in the final allocation of goodwill corresponds to deferred tax recognised during the period following the valuation of the OP trademark in Belgium and of client relationships resulting from major acquisitions carried out in 2020 and 2021 (notably the IPF group, GDP, Loft One, Quenot, Valexim, Humakey and Yxime in the B2B segment). Deferred tax on other adjustments Changes in deferred taxes on other adjustments mainly concern the taxation of contingency provisions (provisions for third party/professional liability and for risks on client accounts), and deferred tax on the Worna LTIP and on adjustments to variables recognised in consolidation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

A provision is set aside for all outstanding obligations, estimated based on rights accrued and salary projections, taking into account mortality rates, employee turnover and a discount. As a reminder, in estimating its retirement benefit obligations for 2021, the Group has taken into account the new basis for attributing benefits prescribed by the IFRS IC in its May 2021 agenda decision. For France, the increase in provisions for retirement benefits is mainly attributable to the service cost totalling €1.6 million, reflecting the increase in the net obligation resulting from the contributions of Foncia personnel in 2021. The net actuarial gain of €0.6 million mainly consists of an actuarial gain of €1 million resulting from the increase in the discount rate over the period, and an actuarial loss of €0.4 million due to experience adjustments. These actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income within consolidated equity net of tax. The increase in long-service awards essentially results from €0.6 million in the service cost for 2021. As a reminder, obligations in respect of long-service awards are included within other long-term benefits in accordance with IAS 19. Any related actuarial gains and losses are taken to profit or loss in the period. Note that the take-up rate for longservice awards was maintained at 100%. In Switzerland, the increase in the net benefit obligation over the period is mainly due to: - a service cost representing CHF 3.7 million (€3.4 million); - a net actuarial gain of CHF 3.1 million, reflecting: - an actuarial gain of CHF 1.9 million owing to the increase in the discount rate from 0.14% to 0.30%, - a loss of CHF 4.8 million owing to lower-than-expected returns on plan assets, - a gain of CHF 2.4 million arising on experience adjustments, - a gain of CHF 3.6 million arising on demographic assumptions due to the significant reduction in the number of employees at DBS and Gribi (591 versus 635 in 2020); - a scope impact with regard to the obligations arising from acquisitions carried out in Switzerland, namely €1.1 million for Intercity, €0.4 million for Contrust, and €0.2 million for BG SA. |Interest cost net of Employee benefits 31 Dec. 2020 Contributions paid Actuarial gains and Exchange Change in scope Service cost the return on plan (€ thousands) (restated) in the period losses differences of consolidation assets France 14,506 1,561 57 (442) (607) 131 Belgium 33 Switzerland 14,413 3,439 23 (2,752) (2,890) 662 1,749 Germany 1,100 (19) Total provisions for retirement benefits and other 30,052 5,000 81 (3,213) (3,497) 662 1,880 employee benefits France 6,727 640 25 (297) 134 (7) Total provisions for long-service awards 6,727 640 25 (297) 134 (7) Total employee benefits 36,779 5,639 106 (3,510) (3,363) 662 1,873|31 Dec. 2021| |---|---| ||15,206 33 14,643 1,081| ||30,963| ||7,221| ||7,221| ||38,184| ----- Calculation assumptions used Actuarial calculations are based on a number of long-term assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The main risks assumed relate to GDP for €0.9 million, La Régionale Immobilière for €0.4 million, Foncia Saint-Louis for €0.4 million and SGIA for €0.2 million. It should also be noted that at 31 December 2020, this item included €0.3 million in contingency provisions booked at the time of the Esset Management acquisition in 2016. Following an analysis of client accounts, these provisions were written back in full during the year, with the resulting net €0.3 million impact recognised within non-recurring items. Provisions for third party and professional liability Taking into account the reclassification of the provision at Axium for €0.9 million (presented in other changes), the balance of this item is €0.8 million lower at 31 December 2021 versus end-2020, due mainly to the net reversals recorded during the period.

Provisions for other disputes In France, this item mainly includes the provision for the Corum dispute for €0.6 million (unchanged over the year) as well as the provision for disputes with franchisees for €0.1 million (€0.4 million written back over the period). Note that the Group took on certain risks representing €0.8 million as a result of acquisitions, mainly concerning IPF for €0.5 million and risks in progress at Foncia Méditerranée for €0.2 million. Outside France, this item chiefly concerns Switzerland for €1.5 million, where the miscellaneous long-standing risks are monitored by the local management team. A net reversal of €0.2 million was recorded during the period. - Update on the dispute with franchisees By way of a reminder, in 2014 franchisees had brought proceedings against the Group after receiving notice that their contracts would not be renewed. They accused the Group of wrongful termination and various breaches of the franchise agreements. Of the 21 initial lawsuits, the Group either settled (most sensitive disputes), or won (before the lower court, on appeal or before the French Supreme Court [Cour de cassation]) the cases. Today, only two disputes are still outstanding, as the franchisees have appealed to the Supreme Court. These disputes concern an amount of €937,000. - Update on the Corum dispute After having terminated its distribution agreement with Primaliance, Corum, a property manager, brought proceedings against Primaliance for trademark infringement for continuing to list the real estate investment trust (SCPI) Corum Origin on its website, www.primaliance.com. The dispute is in progress before the courts. The Group maintained its €0.6 million provision in this respect and did not transfer it to Primaliance when the latter was sold to Bienprévoir.fr. Oral arguments were heard before the court on 21 October 2021. Provisions for other contingencies and expenses These provisions mainly concern: - risks related to commercial leases in France regarding the retroactive removal of rent caps (€0.4 million at 31 December 2021). Note that a net amount of €0.4 million was written back from this provision over the year, mainly in relation to the lease at 7 Rue des Belges in Cannes held by Foncia AD Immobilier, for which the risk of rent cap removal is no longer relevant; - a €0.4 million provision for losses arising on the 2020 Yxime acquisition and relating to outstanding expenses on the Tour Ciel lease at La Défense, which management decided to terminate early at the time of the acquisition. A net reversal of €0.4 million was booked during the year; - a provision for accrued expenses recognised for €0.7 million during the year in respect of AGEFIPH expenses that will actually be incurred in 2022. Provisions for rent payment guarantees The provision for rent payment guarantees remained broadly stable between 2021 and 2020, reflecting (i) a growth effect, driving an upward trend in the provision, and (ii) a post-Covid effect, with the end of the “winter truce” (tenant protection period during winter months applicable in France) as of 31 March 2021. It should be recalled that the amount of the provision set aside by the Group increases in line with the age of the unpaid receivable. Provisions for rent payment guarantees are calculated by reference to late payments relating to current and former lessees, regardless of whether or not lessee statement of accounts (Arrêtés des Comptes _Locataires – ACL) have been drawn up, taking into account the probability of collection (assessed on a statistical basis_ and regularly updated). ----- Provisions for employee disputes In France, the provision remained stable in 2021 at €3.7 million, and concerned 128 lawsuits at end-December compared to 101 at 31 December 2020. Out of the 128 lawsuits in progress, 26 relate to amounts in excess of €0.1 million. The decrease over the period is mainly due to Germany where, as a reminder, provisions had been booked in 2020 for ongoing restructuring for a total amount of €1 million, of which €0.7 million was reversed over the period.",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

At 31 December 2021, the balance of client accounts and “Article 55” transaction accounts therefore represents all of the transactions carried out for each client account. This balance totalled €572 million, reported under assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2021. France’s ALUR law requires the use of separate accounts (opened in the name of the joint owners) for jointly owned properties comprising more than 15 main lots as from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, these separate accounts are not reflected in the statement of financial position. The ordinance dated 31 October 2019 now requires separate accounts to be established for all jointly owned properties by 31 December 2021 at the latest. Accordingly, client funds held in respect of jointly owned properties will gradually disappear as these separate joint ownership and individual accounts are closed. All accounts have been opened, including some just before the end of the year. Consequently, the transfers to certain accounts have not yet been made.

At 31 December 2021, the balance of client accounts and “Article 55” transaction accounts therefore represents all of the transactions carried out for each client account. This balance totalled €572 million, reported under assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2021. France’s ALUR law requires the use of separate accounts (opened in the name of the joint owners) for jointly owned properties comprising more than 15 main lots as from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, these separate accounts are not reflected in the statement of financial position. The ordinance dated 31 October 2019 now requires separate accounts to be established for all jointly owned properties by 31 December 2021 at the latest. Accordingly, client funds held in respect of jointly owned properties will gradually disappear as these separate joint ownership and individual accounts are closed. All accounts have been opened, including some just before the end of the year. Consequently, the transfers to certain accounts have not yet been made. Note that the statement of financial position does not include any amount for Germany or Belgium, which only use separate accounts. |Client accounts and “Article 55” transaction (Hoguet law) Change in Change in scope Translation accounts 31 Dec. 2020 operating items of consolidation adjustments (€ thousands) Amounts due from banks and post office banks, demand 194,673 28,843 54,845 3,312 deposits Financial investments 150,909 (10,868) 690 21 Client accounts 42,994 20,096 502 98 Rental management and letting 388,575 38,070 56,037 3,431 Amounts due from banks and post office banks, demand 126,094 (209,901) 146,226 544 deposits Financial investments 10,169 (4,490) Client accounts 17,644 (57,745) 42,715 2|31 Dec. 2021| |---|---| ||281,672 140,752 63,690| ||486,114| ||62,964 5,679 2,617| |Joint property management 153,907 (272,135) 188,941 547 Transactions: Article 55 bank accounts 11,528 2,614 451 Total client accounts – in debit 554,011 (231,451) 245,429 3,978|71,260| ||14,593 571,967| |Amounts due to banks and post office banks, demand 25,007 11,195 15 deposits Client accounts 363,567 26,876 56,022 3,431 Rental management and letting 388,575 38,071 56,037 3,431 Amounts due to banks and post office banks, demand 1,555 (1,799) 3,957 deposits Client accounts 152,352 (270,336) 184,984 547 Joint property management 153,907 (272,135) 188,941 547|36,217 449,897| ||486,115| ||3,713 67,547| ||71,260| |Transactions: Article 55 bank accounts 11,528 2,613 451|14,592| |Total client accounts – in credit 554,011 (231,451) 245,429 3,978|571,967| -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

The new group opted for a tax loss carry-forward system along the lines of the former tax consolidation group, but with a broader scope. The current tax expense for the tax consolidation group for 2021 amounts to €0.5 million (versus a €0.2 million tax saving in 2020 corresponding to philanthropy tax credits provisioned by Emeria Europe and Emeria Technologies). Current income tax expense excluding the tax consolidation group essentially concerns companies acquired in 2021 for €2.3 million, Efficity for €1.5 million and Foncia Brette for €0.3 million. Current income tax expense for foreign companies relates to Belgium for €0.9 million and Switzerland for €0.6 million. The decrease in the CVAE tax on value added in 2021 is mainly due to the reduction in the tax rate (50%). Net deferred tax income in the period mainly results from the decrease in deferred tax liabilities relating to the amortisation of remeasurement adjustments, along with the capitalisation of tax on non-deducted financial expenses within the scope of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD I). |Of which other Of which other non- Other financial income and expenses 2020 2021 monetary financial monetary financial (€ thousands) (restated) income (expenses) income (expenses)|Change| |---|---| |Foreign exchange gains (losses) 301 301 28 Net interest cost on pension and other employee benefit 148 148 (272) obligations Capital gains (losses) on financial disposals less costs 6 ( 13) 19 (10) to sell Net impairment of financial assets 517 517 (920) Gains (losses) on available-for-sale financial assets 60 60 105 Discounting cost, net (1,274) (1,274) 326 Other financial income and expenses (1,485) ( 1,414) (71) (351)|272 420 16 1,437 (45) (1,600) (1,135)| |Other financial income and expenses (1,728) (1,066) (662) (1,093)|(635)| |Of which other financial income 6,781 5,801 1,048 808 Of which other financial expenses (8,509) (6,867) (1,709) (1,901)|5,973 (6,608)| |Income tax benefit (expense) 2020 2021 (€ thousands) (restated)|Change| |---|---| |Current tax expense excluding CVAE tax on value added (6,031) (2,352) Of which income tax expense relating to the tax consolidation (503) 207 group Of which reclassification of provision for Esset Management tax 43 Of which income tax expense excluding the tax consolidation group (4,149) (1,097) Of which income tax expense relating to foreign companies (1,379) (1,505) Of which CVAE tax on value added in France (6,312) (10,397) Deferred taxes 11,446 10,027|405 (710) (43) (3,052) 125 4,085 1,420| |Income tax benefit (expense) (897) (2,722)|1,825| -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570

More specifically, UFC is seeking payment from Foncia Groupe of an amount of €2.30 per month and per lessee over a period of five years and estimates the number of lessees concerned at 318,400, bringing the total damages to €44 million. In its defence, the Group argues that the French law of 6 July 1989 on residential lease agreements, upon which basis UFC filed its claim, made no provision for class actions at the time of the alleged offence; that no law existed preventing lessees being charged for receiving notices to pay; and that this was therefore a lawful practice. Oral arguments were exchanged before the Nanterre _Tribunal de Grande Instance in March 2018. The decision handed down in May 2018 dismissed UFC’s claims on the grounds that they fell outside the scope of a class action. UFC appealed this decision. In its ruling of 20 May 2021, the court of appeal dismissed all of UFC’s claims and ordered it to pay the Group €10,000 under Article 700 of the French Code of Civil Procedure (Code de procédure civil). UFC has appealed the decision before the French Supreme Court. The brief for UFC before the French Supreme Court was filed on 26 November 2021. The Group considers that no provision needs to be accrued in this respect in its financial statements at 31 December 2021. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,77,NOTE 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS,77.1,,77.1.1,,"Emeria Group enters the UK market Emeria’s March 2022 acquisition of FirstPort, the UK’s leading residential property services company, marks a further stage in its international development strategy. FirstPort operates in England, Scotland and Wales, employing more than 4,000 people and with €120 million in revenue. FirstPort specialises in the jointly owned property management business, and is also present in the rental management and transactions markets. The acquisition of FirstPort marks an important milestone in Emeria’s value creation journey, and will help the Group become the world’s leading residential real estate services company. The aim in entering the UK is to become the leader in the three biggest European markets of the UK, France and Germany. Emeria share capital increase On 14 March 2022, Emeria carried out a share capital increase in cash for a total nominal amount of €17,810,645.88 in favour of its sole shareholder, Flamingo Lux II SCA. This capital increase was carried out with no issue premium by increasing the par value of each of its 593,688,196 existing ordinary shares from €1 to €1.03. The cash payment by Flamingo Lux II SCA was made on the same day. New interest rate hedge Following the March 2021 refinancing operation, the Group acquired two interest rate cap agreements in January 2022 for a total amount of €4.2 million. These two instruments have the following characteristics: - Cumulative notional amount: €1,148 million. - Floating rate hedged: 3-month Euribor. - Hedged rate: maximum rate of 1%. - Start: 24 January 2022. - Expiry: 27 December 2024. These two caps allow the Group to protect itself against the risk of a rise in the 3-month Euribor on the equivalent of half of its refinanced debt. The fair value of these caps represented €14.7 million at 31 March 2022. Ukraine crisis Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has important ramifications for financial markets and the price of certain commodities, and will impact the entire global economy. Although the Group has no direct exposure to the Ukraine or Russian markets, it continues to closely monitor the conflict’s development. The indirect consequences of the crisis on the Group’s activities (and its clients) remain difficult to assess at this stage. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,570
