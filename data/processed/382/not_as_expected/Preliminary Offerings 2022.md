or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction

**Professional investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’**
product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in respect of the debt
securities described in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
such debt securities is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt
securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently


-----

offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Professional investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s**
product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the debt securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in
the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the debt securities to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the debt securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the offering**
memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU, as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the debt
securities described in the offering memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors
in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the debt securities or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The
offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in any Members
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from a
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. The offering memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The debt securities are not intended to be offered, sold**
or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”);
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the debt securities or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering
or selling the debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may
be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The offering memorandum has been prepared on the
basis that any offer of the securities in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
securities. The offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

**NOTICE TO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INVESTORS**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”) where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State
of the EEA or the United Kingdom that is subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of the Senior Secured Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes
of the Prospectus Regulation.

**NOTICE TO U.K. INVESTORS**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the
“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in

the EUWA or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA


-----

(the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the
Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes
in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of
the UK Prospectus Regulation.

Notwithstanding the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, any references in this
offering memorandum to European Union law should be treated as references to such law as applies in
England and Wales from time to time including as retained, amended, extended, re-enacted or otherwise
given effect on or after 11:00 pm on January 31, 2020.

_MiFID II Product Governance_

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of J.P. Morgan AG (the “Manufacturer”), the
target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes described in this offering memorandum
has led to the conclusion that (i) the target market for such Senior Secured Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels for
distribution of such Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Senior Secured Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of such Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturer’s target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

expectations and projections about future events. All statements other than statements of historical facts
included in this offering memorandum including, without limitation, statements regarding our future
financial position, risks and uncertainties related to our business, strategy, capital expenditure, projected
costs and our plans and objectives for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking
statements. Words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,”
“should,” “estimate,” “risk” and similar expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or
may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. You
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

In addition any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum
and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth
in this offering memorandum.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of
the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in this offering memorandum. Factors that could cause such differences
in actual results include:

- the high level of competition in the markets in which we operate;

- the impact of volatile economic conditions on demand for our services and our subscriber base;

- our ability to generate strong advertising sales;

- our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and the risks associated with those
acquisitions;

- the possibility of competition authorities delaying or preventing acquisitions;

- acceptance of our content by the public;

- our dependence on relationships with content owners;

- our ability to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards;

customer support;

- our ability to secure spectrum;

- current or future levels of EU regulation of the level of mobile roaming charges;

- the continued implementation of political and economic reforms in our countries of operation;

- our ability to cope with more extensive regulation;

- the impact of changes in labor laws on our business;

- our ability to comply with applicable data protection laws and policies;

- the impact of legal proceedings on our business;

- the extent to which our business operations are protected by intellectual property rights;

- our ability to cope with increased inflation;

- the impact of changes to tax legislation on our business; and

Senior Secured Notes and our structure as discussed under “Risk Factors.”

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our
expectations in “Risk Factors” and “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Other sections of this offering memorandum describe_
additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors. We cannot assess the
impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements
as a prediction of actual results.

**_Adoption of New Accounting Policies_**

We have adopted various accounting policies during the financial periods presented in this offering
memorandum. With effect as of January 1, 2019, we have adopted IFRS 16 (Leases). For the impact of
the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) on our financial statements, see Note 4 to the 2019 Company Audited
Financial Statements. See “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations—_
_Implementation of Accounting Policies and Accounting Updates.”_

As permitted under IFRS 16, we did not apply a full retrospective approach when adopting these
accounting policies and as a result have not restated any historical financial data of the Company
(including comparative figures) prior to the date disclosed above. As a result of the adoptions of these
accounting policies, our results and financial position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018
may not be directly comparable to our results and financial position as of dates and for periods after
December 31, 2018.

**_Company Segment Reporting_**

We are a pan regional distribution platform of cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet and
telephony services in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Croatia, North
Macedonia and Greece. Our business has grown substantially in terms of scale, geographic reach and
service offering since 2018 through both organic growth and acquisitions. As a consequence of this
growth, our Group-level financial reporting has evolved during the last several years.

In order to provide a meaningful analysis of our results of operations during the period under review
discussed under “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations,” in addition to a discussion of our Group-level consolidated results of operations_
based on IFRS measures, we also present a discussion of revenues, UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases of our Serbia Group, Slovenia Group, Bosnia Group,
Montenegro Group and Media Group segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021. We also present a discussion of revenues,
UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 of: our Croatia Group,
which we added following the completion of the Tele2 Croatia Acquisition (as further described in this
offering memorandum); and our Bulgaria Group, which we added following the completion of the
Vivacom Acquisition (as further described in this offering memorandum). We also present a discussion
of revenues, UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 of our Greece Group, which
we added following the completion of the Nova Acquisition (as further described in this offering
memorandum).

Under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments,” we present our segment data in the notes to the annual and interim
consolidated financial statements. In Note 5 to the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements,
we disclose the segment results for nine business segments, which are as follows:

- _Slovenia Group segment. This segment includes the results of our cable and mobile services and_
DTH operations in Slovenia;

- _Serbia Group segment. This segment includes the results of cable services in Serbia and DTH_
operations in Serbia, and North Macedonia, including the results of Ikom (acquired in April 2017).
This segment also includes the results of Absolut Solutions, (although these results are not reflected
in the statutory consolidated results of the Serbia Group segment);

- _Bosnia Group segment. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH operations in_
Bosnia and Herzegovina;


-----

- _Montenegro Group segment. This segment includes the results of our cable and DTH business in_
Montenegro;

- _Bulgaria Group segment. This segment includes the results of our telecommunications operations_
in Bulgaria, including the results of Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia EAD and Digital Cable
Television OOD;

- _Croatia Group segment. This segment includes the results of our mobile services in Croatia. We_
expect that following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, the results of Optima
Telekom will be included in this segment;

- _Greece Group segment. This segment includes the results of Nova’s telecommunications and media_
operations in Greece. We expect that following completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition, the
results of Wind Hellas will be included in this segment;

- _Media Group segment. This segment includes the results of our media and content business in_
Southeastern Europe including the results of N1 Info, Grand Production, Orlando Kids, Nova TV,
Nova M and Nova BH as well as United Media S.à r.l., United Media Network AG, Direct Media,
Nova BG, Dan Graf and Vestnik Telegraph EOOD; and

- _Other segments. This includes our other operating business, EON TV International (previously_
known as Solford Trading Ltd.) (which operates NetTV Plus), Shoppster, Mainstream and D
Express, and our non-operating holding companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria
Serbia Holdco B.V. and Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l.).

As part of our segment analysis, we monitor, among others, key performance metrics such as UG
Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure at the segment level. While we adopted IFRS
16 with effect from January 1, 2019, we did not give effect to IFRS 16 in the calculation of these metrics
until January 1, 2021. Starting from 2021, we revised the methodology of calculation of UG Adjusted
EBITDA and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, which now includes the impact from the
implementation of IFRS 16. For comparability purposes, in this offering memorandum we present the
following unaudited financial information:

(i) UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, in each case both at the Group and
the segment level, in line with the revised methodology (i.e., incorporating IFRS 16 effect) for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and
2021;

(ii) UG Adjusted EBITDAaL, which is calculated as UG Adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of
expenses that were capitalized as a result of the implementation of IFRS 16, both at the Group and
the segment level, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2021; and

(iii) UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases, which is calculated as UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure excluding the impact of right-of-use asset additions and, starting from 2021, the rightof-use asset modifications and prepayments, both at the Group and the segment level, for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021.

See “—Capital Expenditure, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure
_after Leases” and “Summary of Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas Historical,_
_Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain Other Financial Data.”_

Since we only adopted IFRS 16 since January 1, 2019, we have not restated any previous historical
financial data. As a result, UG Adjusted EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDAaL, UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases presented in this offering memorandum


-----

for the year ended December 31, 2018 do not account for the effect from the implementation of IFRS
16, and may not be directly comparable to the metrics presented for periods after December 31, 2018.

**_Capital Expenditure, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after_**
**_Leases_**

Capital expenditure represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of settop box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labor
costs), cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer
hardware and software, as well as certain programming rights and licenses.

In this offering memorandum, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we have derived
capital expenditure for the Company from the Company Audited Financial Statements and, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, from the Company Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements.

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by programming rights
and intragroup adjustments, assets held for sale, application of IFRS 15 for customer acquisition costs
in SBB Serbia and overflow between periods.

Programming rights adjustments represent the difference following a change in how we account for
programming rights. Until December 31, 2016, our Media Group segment included the total value of
license agreements signed for programming rights with a term longer than one year in its UG Adjusted
Capital Expenditure. For the purpose of IFRS, however, the Group had recognized these programming
rights as capital expenditure in the period, only to the extent of assets available for broadcasting (i.e.,
one season). Starting from January 1, 2017, our Media Group segment has followed the Group’s
approach. However, as certain programming rights prior to this date had already been reported as UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure by our Media Group segment, there was a difference compared to the
Group’s capital expenditure for the period. This adjustment has been decreasing since December 31,
2016 as long-term license agreements (which had previously been reported as UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure) are expiring.

Intragroup adjustments relate to unrealized profit on the intragroup sale of end-user equipment by SBB
Serbia. When SBB Serbia sells this equipment to other United Group companies in compliance with
applicable transfer pricing requirements, it makes an unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized
profits are eliminated for the purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with IFRS, but are not
eliminated for the purpose of our management accounts (which are not prepared in accordance with
IFRS).

The application of IFRS 15 for customer acquisition costs in SBB Serbia reflects the additional effect
of harmonizing our accounting policy with respect to the capitalization of subscriber acquisition costs
for rebinding, upselling and cross-selling (which in the past were not eligible to be capitalized, but under
IFRS 15 qualify for capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the preparation of our
management accounts.

Assets held for sale relate to programming rights acquired by our Media Group segment for other Group
segments which were recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group
segments after March 31 and September 30, 2021.

Overflow between periods relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the
closing of our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given
period reflects the additional capital expenditure incurred between the preparation of our management
accounts and our accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS for such period.


-----

In addition, in this offering memorandum, we present UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases,
which is calculated as UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure excluding the impact of right-of-use asset
additions and, starting from 2021 the right-of-use asset modifications and prepayments. See “—
_Company Segment Reporting” and “Summary of Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind_
_Hellas Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain Other Financial Data.”_

In addition, for informational purposes only, we describe our anticipated UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure after Leases for the year ending December 31, 2021 based on management estimates,
which may vary from our actual Group level capital expenditure data when it is prepared in accordance
with IFRS.

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases and our future UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases estimates are prepared
based on management accounts rather than IFRS.

PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb has not audited, reviewed or performed any procedures with
respect to UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases, future UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases estimates included in
this offering memorandum, and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb does not express
an opinion or any other form of assurance on such information. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb
assumes no responsibility for and denies any association with or responsibility for the Company’s
calculation of UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases, future
UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases estimates.

December 31, 2020, which was the average rate during that period; RSD 117.6174 per €1.00 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which was the average rate during that period; and
RSD 117.5778 per €1.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which was the average

The financial data of our Bosnia and Bulgaria Group segments (when presented in euros) presented in
this offering memorandum use the following exchange rates:


-----

- _Bosnian mark to euro: BAM 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bosnian mark is_
pegged to the euro.

- _Bulgarian lev to euro: BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, which is the rate at which the Bulgarian lev is pegged_
to the euro.

**_Wind Hellas Historical Financial Data_**

We have included in this offering memorandum:

(i) consolidated financial data of Wind Hellas (as defined under “Certain Definitions”) as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the comparative information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2019, derived from its audited consolidated financial statements and the
related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, which were prepared in
accordance with IFRS (as defined herein) and are included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum (the “Wind Hellas Audited Financial Statements”), and

(ii) condensed consolidated interim financial data of Wind Hellas (as defined under “Certain
_Definitions”) as of and for the nine and three months, ended September 30, 2021, and the_
comparative information for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2020, derived from
its unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes thereto
as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which were prepared in accordance
with IAS 34, as adopted by the EU, and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum
(the “Wind Hellas Unaudited Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Wind Hellas
Audited Financial Statements, the “Wind Hellas Financial Statements”).

We also present unaudited summary financial data for the last two quarters ended September 30, 2021
for Wind Hellas, which has been derived by subtracting the applicable income statement data for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 from the applicable income statement data for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021.

In addition, we present unaudited summary financial data for the twelve months ended September 30,
2021 for Wind Hellas, which has been derived by subtracting the applicable financial data for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 from the financial data for the year ended December 31, 2020 and
adding the financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

_Adoption of New Accounting Policies_

Wind Hellas has adopted various accounting policies during the financial periods presented in this
offering memorandum. With effect as of January 1, 2019, Wind Hellas has adopted IFRS 16 (Leases)
using the modified retrospective approach as permitted under IFRS. Under this approach, comparative
information was not restated and the cumulative effect of the first-time application of IFRS 16 was
recognized as accumulated deficit at the date of initial application.

_Financial information for Victus Joint Operation_

Wind Hellas has a 50% share in the Victus Joint Operation. The Victus Joint Operation is accounted
for as a joint operation and Wind Hellas’ share of the Victus Joint Operation’s assets, liabilities and
transactions is reflected in the Wind Hellas Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. The Victus Joint Operation is an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Bridge Facilities and
therefore is not subject to the covenants included therein. On the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date,
the Victus Joint Operation is expected to be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the existing
Indentures and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and therefore not to be subject to the covenants
therein. In addition, the Victus Joint Operation will be an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the SSN
Indenture and therefore will not be subject to the covenants included therein.

**_Vivacom Historical Financial Data_**

We have included in this offering memorandum condensed consolidated interim financial data of BTC
for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, derived from its unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020, which were prepared in accordance with “IAS 34,” as adopted by the EU, and are
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum (the “Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements”).

The audited financial statements of Vivacom as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020
are publicly available, but are not included in this offering memorandum. The financial data of Vivacom
has been consolidated in the Company's historical financial information from July 31, 2020, the closing
date of the Vivacom Acquisition.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information**

We present in this offering memorandum certain unaudited pro forma financial information (the
“Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”), which includes:

(i) the unaudited pro forma balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2021 (the
“Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet”); and

(ii) the unaudited pro forma income statements of the Company for the year ended December 31,
2020, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 and the last two
quarters ended September 30, 2021 (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements”).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on and derived from, and should be read in
conjunction with, the Company Audited Financial Statements, the Company Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements, the Wind Hellas Audited Financial Statements, the Wind Hellas Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet presents the Company’s financial position on a pro forma
basis as if the Transactions, as further described under “Summary—The Transactions,” “Use of
_Proceeds” and in the footnotes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, had occurred as of_
September 30, 2021. The Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements give effect to: (i) the Transactions,
as further described under “Summary—The Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds” and in the footnotes to
the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information as if they had been completed on the first day of the
relevant period described in such Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement (the first day of each such
relevant period being January 1, 2020, January 1, 2021 and April 1, 2021); and (ii) the Vivacom
Acquisition and the Vivacom Transactions as if they had been completed on January 1, 2020, as
reflected in the relevant Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on available information and certain
assumptions that we believe are reasonable and factually supportable. The assumptions and estimates
underlying the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information are described in the accompanying notes
thereto. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and
is not intended to represent or be indicative of the financial condition or results of operations that we
would have reported had the Transactions, the Vivacom Acquisition and the Vivacom Transactions
actually occurred during the periods and as of the dates presented, and the Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Information does not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition as of
any future date or for any future period. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments
nor the resulting Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.


-----

The Group is not subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC. Accordingly, the Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation
S-X of the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting
standards. For more information, please refer to “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.”

The Wind Hellas Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in
accordance with IFRS, and specifically in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations,” which
sets out the obligation for the acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
at their acquisition date fair values. As a result, for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial
statements of the Company in the future, the total purchase price will be allocated to the tangible,
intangible and other assets acquired, as well as the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed based
on the estimated fair values as of the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, with any excess of the cost
of the Wind Hellas Acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of the net identifiable assets
acquired allocated to goodwill. No such purchase price allocation was performed as of the date of this
offering memorandum, and therefore, except where indicated, no fair value adjustments have been made
to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects) in respect of the
Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet. Similarly, the Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements do not
include any adjustments with respect to additional depreciation or amortization that would be charged
as a result of the recognition of new depreciable assets or charges or credits as a result of the change in
value of any existing assets or liabilities.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is presented in millions of euros unless otherwise
indicated. Vivacom’s historical financial information is presented in millions of Bulgarian Lev. For the
purposes of the relevant Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, financial information reported in
Bulgarian lev has been translated to euros on the basis stated in relevant footnotes to the Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information includes unaudited pro forma adjustments that are
factually supportable and directly attributable to the Transactions, the Vivacom Acquisition and the
Vivacom Transactions.

In addition to the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the Vivacom Acquisition, the Company also: (i) acquired
Tele2 d.o.o. za telekomunikacijske usluge (now trading as Telemach Hrvatska d.o.o.) and has
consolidated its results from March 1, 2020; (ii) obtained control over Nova and has consolidated its
results from November 12, 2020; (for more information, please refer to Note 23 in the Company
Audited Financial Statements); (iii) acquired Nova Broadcasting Group and has consolidated its results
from January 22, 2021; and (iv) has completed certain other acquisitions in 2021, as described elsewhere
in this offering memorandum. The Company Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information does not
include adjustments with respect to the acquisitions referred to above. It does not also include the
adjustment related to the Vantage Towers Disposal described elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

In the “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information” section, we refer to Crystal Almond Intermediary
Holdings Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “CAIHL” or “Crystal Almond Midco.”

**Group Data on a Pro Forma Run-Rate Basis**

We also present in this offering memorandum certain financial data of the Group on a pro forma runrate basis. The pro forma run-rate financial date adjusts certain financial data derived from the unaudited
pro forma financial information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum with (a) the estimated
last two quarters results not yet consolidated into the Group's results for the contribution of Optima
Telekom, sourced from its unaudited management accounts, which have been aligned in certain aspects
to the Group’s accounting policies; (b) the estimated last two quarters results expected to be generated
by Tessa Energy, based on management’s assumptions regarding, among others, its investment in the
Kremena Wind Park, as if the acquisition of Tessa Energy and its investment in the Kremena Wind
Park was completed on April 1, 2021; (c) (i) the estimated last two quarters results not yet consolidated


-----

into the Group’s results for the contribution of Networx, sourced from its unaudited management
accounts, which have been aligned in certain aspects to the Group’s accounting policies, (ii) the results
of the following companies for the period from April 1, 2021 to the date on which the results of such
companies were consolidated with the Group’s results, each of which were acquired during the period:
N3, ComNet, D Express and Mainstream, and derived from their respective unaudited management
accounts, which might not be fully aligned to the Group’s accounting policies, and (iii) the estimated
effect on the last two quarters results derived from certain synergies expected to be generated following
the acquisition of Vestnik Telegraf, based on management’s estimates regarding the impact of certain
actions and initiatives implemented in connection with this acquisition, as if these actions were
implemented on April 1, 2021; (d) the estimated last two quarters results generated by Wind Hellas’
fiber network business that was transferred to HELLENIC OPENFIBER Single Member S.A., a newly
established and separate subsidiary of Crystal Almond Midco (“FiberCo”), on January 3, 2022, based
on management’s estimates; and (e) the estimated effect on the last two quarters results derived from
(i) certain cost savings (primarily in respect of staff costs) expected to be generated from the integration
of Wind Hellas and Nova, and (ii) revenue expected to be generated from existing Wind Hellas’
contracts with the Greek government relating to the connectivity procurement program SYZEFXIS II,
in each case based on management’s assumptions regarding the impact of actions and initiatives
implemented in connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition, as if the Wind Hellas Acquisition was
completed, and such actions and initiatives were fully implemented, on April 1, 2021. The Group data
on a pro forma run-rate basis presented in this offering memorandum is based on a number of
assumptions and estimates made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s
judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the adjustments are
inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in this
offering memorandum. See “Summary of Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas
_Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain Other Financial Data” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Pro_
_Forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Adjusted EBITDAaL included in this offering memorandum.”_

The Group data on a pro forma run-rate basis included in this offering memorandum has been prepared
by the Company’s management. The Group data on a pro forma run-rate basis is not intended to and
does not represent historical or future performance for any period. Such information is the sole
responsibility of the Company’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb has not audited,
reviewed, examined or compiled, or has applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the Group data
on a pro forma run-rate basis and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers d.o.o. Zagreb does not provide
any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this offering memorandum.

- Ratio of Pro Forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDAaL to Pro Forma

together with compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) are collectively referred to as the “Non-IFRS
Measures.” The unaudited Non-IFRS Measures are not specifically defined under IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting principles. These measures are presented in this offering memorandum
because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in the telecommunications industry
as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure. These measures
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements
under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items
as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in
accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other
companies. Our management believes the data for each respective company or group, along with
comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating
performance in the periods presented. These measures are used in the internal management of our
business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, in evaluating operating
performance.

The Non-IFRS Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in
isolation or as a substitute for our or a relevant group’s results or any performance measures under IFRS
as set forth in our consolidated financial statements or the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements.
Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect our future requirements for capital commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
profit and loss statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and

- other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will
be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying
primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only supplementally to evaluate our


-----

performance. Please see “Summary of Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas
_Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain Other Financial Data,” “Selected Company_
_Historical Financial Data,” “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations,” “Wind Hellas Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and the Company Audited Financial Statements_
(including the related notes), the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements (including the
related notes), the Wind Hellas Audited Financial Statements (including the related notes) and the Wind
Hellas Unaudited Interim Financial Statements (including the related notes) included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

In this offering memorandum, we use the non-IFRS measure Adjusted EBITDAaL to represent the
relevant EBITDA further adjusted to exclude the impact of expenses that were capitalized as a result of
the implementation of IFRS 16. The relevant Adjusted EBITDAaL measures are comparable to the
corresponding Adjusted EBITDA measures that we reported prior to the implementation of IFRS 16.
For example, UG Adjusted EBITDAaL for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this offering
memorandum, corresponds to the figure for UG Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2018, as we presented it prior to the implementation of IFRS 16.

For a description of how our Non-IFRS Measures are calculated from our consolidated results from
operations and a reconciliation of our Non-IFRS Measures to our results for the periods presented in
this offering memorandum, please see “Summary of Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind
_Hellas Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain Other Financial Data.”_

**Overview**

We are the leading telecommunications player in Southeastern Europe, with a unique media ecosystem
to complement our regional distribution capabilities. As of September 30, 2021, we provided services
to approximately 15.2 million RGUs and covered approximately 4.3 million homes passed after giving
effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition and other signed acquisitions. We offer a diverse and
differentiated line of products and services and are the clear multi-play leader in our footprint across
Slovenia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, with an
addressable market that comprised 13.4 million households as of September 30, 2021. We also produce
and distribute distinctive and attractive content for our Pay-TV channels across a wide range of media
formats. The Group’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €1,383.9 million,
and the UG Adjusted EBITDAaL for such period was €523.4 million. The Pro forma Group had RunRate Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended September 30, 2021 of €2,536.2 million and
Pro forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDAaL for September 30, 2021 was
€969.0 million.

We have grown rapidly through both value-accretive acquisitions and organic growth. In August 2021,
we signed an agreement to acquire Wind Hellas, a leading integrated telecommunications operator and
the number three mobile-telephony services provider in Greece, furthering our penetration into the
Greek market following our acquisition of Nova (formerly Forthnet S.A.) in 2020. After giving effect
to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, approximately 1/3 of our pro forma revenues for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 would have been derived in Greece. We have also made a number of smaller
acquisitions in Bulgaria, building on our leading positions following completion of the Vivacom
Acquisition in 2020 and the acquisition of Nova BG in 2021, and in Croatia, where we acquired Tele2
Croatia in 2020 and we have signed an agreement to acquire Optima Telekom in 2021. We have also
continued to expand our in-house media and content offering through acquisitions, with a focus on
expansion in euro or euro-pegged currency jurisdictions. We have significantly improved our business
profile in terms of scale, geographic exposure and currency mix and product diversification.

We are a leading player in Pay-TV, broadband, fixed telephony and mobile telephony across the
jurisdictions in which we operate, as shown below:

___________________________

Source: Company information.
(1) Market position is based on total subscribers.

(2) We are the leading high-speed cable broadband internet provider in each of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria
within our footprint, overall leading provider in Slovenia within our footprint and out-of-footprint, and we have the second-largest
broadband and telephony market share in each of these countries, behind the respective incumbents with national footprints. In
Bulgaria, following the acquisition of Vivacom, we have the largest broadband and fixed-line telephony market share.

(3) Company Footprint RGUs consist of Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony Company RGUs.

(4) Company DTH RGUs in Slovenia include Company RGUs for DTH services provided in Slovenia and internationally, pre-paid
DTH services and Pink International (which distributes Pink channels in Western Europe) and DTH North Macedonia.

(5) Based on aggregated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (including Wind Hellas’ and Optima Telekom’s
revenues for the period), United Group’s Media Group’s external revenue represented 12% of our total aggregated revenue for the
same period; figures for Nova BG for the period prior to its acquisition by us are based on management accounts.

(6) This figure includes 1.9 million homes passed through Vivacom’s FTTP / VDSL network. Nova uses OTE’s wholesale Local Loop
Unbundling (LLU) and Bitstream services for its fixed network access across Greece; pro forma for the Wind Hellas.

(7) Most Cable RGUs for Nova represent broadband and fixed-telephony. Customers of Nova are serviced through a local loop
unbundling arrangement with the incumbent OTE.

Our in-house content business produces distinctive and attractive content for our Pay-TV channels and
has historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. We currently produce over 50% of the total content in our
national (terrestrial) and most of our Pay-TV operations, and our main prime-time programs typically
receive ratings of between 20% and 50% in the markets in which they are available. As part of our
media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution in our
markets. We are also a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content
owners because of our well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe.

Our core telecommunications business is complemented by our two over-the-top (“OTT”) distribution
platforms that customers can access through internet-based streaming: (i) EON, our regional OTT
platform in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Greece, which enables customers connected
to our competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to access our attractive
portfolio of Pay-TV channels; and (ii) NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which delivers
ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we
launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online shopping platform, which offers more than 20


-----

popular product categories, and is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia
and Slovenia.

We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain and grow our market-leading positions, as we
provide a well-invested network, some of the fastest download speeds, access to desirable media content
and high-quality customer service, all of which has led to relatively low churn rates and high customer
loyalty. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their
everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand and makes our business more resilient to macroeconomic disruptions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic where we saw data and voice traffic
increase.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_We operate in structurally attractive markets._**

We operate in countries across Southeastern Europe that are attractive telecommunication markets due
to favourable competitive dynamics, relatively low penetration of broadband and Pay-TV, and a
predictable regulatory environment. Our countries of operation have also generally experienced
stronger real GDP growth than the Eurozone average in recent years. Most recently, in 2021, real GDP
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia grew by 5.7%
on average compared to 5.0% on average in the Eurozone. In addition, real GDP in these countries is
currently estimated to grow at an average of 2.9% by 2025, which is higher than the average estimated
growth of 1.4% in the Eurozone (source: IMF).

After completing the Wind Hellas Acquisition, across most of our footprint, there are only one to two
other companies in each of the countries where we are present that own and operate the majority of the
broadband infrastructure. While in some of our markets a few small players own their broadband
network, we have competitive advantages over them given our nationwide presence and the benefits of
scale that we enjoy as nationwide network operators. Within the four major geographies where we offer
mobile-telephony, with the exception of Slovenia, there are only three mobile network operators
(“MNO”) in each country. The presence of fewer players owning broadband and mobile networks
within a single competitive environment typically results in healthy competition in the retail market
which leads to profitable investments.

The countries in which we operate are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that
are currently underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets and therefore
present an attractive structural growth proposition. Between 2018 and 2020, fixed broadband internet
household penetration rates increased from approximately 65% to 72% in Bulgaria, from approximately
59% to 66% in Serbia, from approximately 73% to 75% in Slovenia and from approximately 100% to
106% in Greece. Over the same period, overall Pay-TV market penetration rates increased from
approximately 73% to 89% in Serbia and from approximately 76% to 77% in Slovenia, and remained
stable at approximately 68% in Bulgaria. As a result, over the past few years we have experienced a
steady growth in the number of subscribers across our markets and we expect our subscriber base to
grow further over the next couple of years. Subscribers are increasingly upgrading to higher speed
broadband offerings due to a variety of factors including, among others, the increase in remote working
and continued growth in high bandwidth applications.

The national telecommunication framework in each of our countries of operation is overseen by
competent national regulatory authorities. As members of the EU, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia and
Croatia which together account for than 3/4 of our revenues after giving effect to the Wind Hellas
Acquisition, have national regulatory frameworks that align with EU guidelines and directives, which
provides for a relatively stable regulatory environment.

**_We are the leading integrated multi-play provider across Southeastern Europe._**


-----

We are the leading integrated multi-play provider in Southeastern Europe based on market share by
number of subscribers, a position that we have reinforced through acquisitions we have made which
have allowed us to expand geographically, diversify our business and increase our customer base. Our
leadership position in the region will be further strengthened following the completion of the Wind
Hellas Acquisition, which will add 3.4 million RGUs as of September 30, 2021. In addition, the
Vivacom Acquisition has increased our addressable market by 35%. Our scale and presence across
Southeastern Europe and across our product portfolios allows us to cross-sell our services and expand
the number of multi-play packages we provide, creating opportunities to further expand our customer
base and continue to strengthen our leadership position in the region.

In the Pay-TV market, we have leveraged our complementary cable and DTH platforms to gain leading
market shares in Southeastern Europe and become the pan regional leader with 2.1 million unique
subscribers as of September 30, 2021. In particular, we are the leading Pay-TV provider in each of
Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with market shares of 45%, 39% and 40%, respectively,
as of September 30, 2021, each based on number of subscribers; and we are the second largest Pay-TV
operator in Greece, with a market share of 27% as of September 30, 2021, and the largest in Bulgaria,
with a market share of 27% as of September 30, 2021, each based on number of subscribers. In addition,
we are the largest DTH Pay-TV provider in Montenegro and are among the main providers of DTH
Pay-TV in North Macedonia and Croatia. Among high-speed cable broadband internet providers, we
are the leader in each of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina within our footprint and have a
large broadband market share overall, behind only the respective incumbents with national footprints.
We are also the leading provider of broadband internet by number of subscribers in Bulgaria. In
addition, we are the market leader in fixed-line telephony in Bulgaria and the second-largest fixed-line
telephony provider in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In mobile-telephony, we are the
third largest MNO in each of Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and, after giving effect to the Wind Hellas
Acquisition, Greece, with market shares based on the number of subscribers of, respectively,
approximately 24% as of June 30, 2021, 29% as of December 31, 2020, and 19% and 24% as of
September 30, 2021.

**_We are a recognized media leader benefitting from content ownership, own production and strategic_**
**_partnerships._**

We believe we are the recognized media leader in Southeastern Europe, offering fully integrated
production and distribution of attractive and distinctive local content for the entire region, which has a
population of approximately 40 million, with similar languages, cultures and entertainment preferences.
Our focus on the entire Southeastern European region allows us to maintain and serve some of the
smaller markets where smaller operators are less able to provide first rate localized content on an
economically efficient basis. At the same time, we believe international players would find it difficult
and costly to expand into the region, due to language and cultural barriers.

Through our owned-content business we directly own many of the region’s popular pay-TV channels.
In addition, as of September 30, 2021, we produced 50% of our content locally. Owning our content
allows us to control the end-to-end creation process, produce a wide range of diversified and attractive
local and genre specific content and maintain a structural hedge on content costs. Our in-house
production has significantly increased over recent years, and the content offered has continuously
improved. In addition, we have established a digital music production and content distribution business,
and have leading full format TV stations with appealing content in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Montenegro. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia, Total TV and EON. Following the
Nova Acquisition in November 2020, we also offer content under EON-branded channels in Greece,
and in January 2021, we acquired Nova Broadcasting Group, Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media
company, becoming a major content player in Bulgaria.

In addition to our owned content offerings, our pay-TV distribution platforms typically license the rights
for the distribution of our own channels, as well as third-party owned channels. We believe that our pan
regional presence, large subscriber base, advanced network, cable and DTH platforms, leading market


-----

positions and relationships with all major third-party distribution platforms make us an attractive partner
to third-party content owners, including major sporting leagues (such as the World Cup qualifiers and
the League of Nations). As a result, we are able to enter into strategic partnerships with third-party
contract providers to distribute their content to the entire region on attractive terms, whereas competitors
operating in a single country within the region cannot offer similarly broad coverage. We are also able
to offer our content partners value added services such as subtitles for television shows and can spread
the costs across our operations in the entire region, whereas we believe such costs would not be
economically justifiable for a competitor operating within a single country in the region. The table
below highlights our differentiated media offering:

**_We have well-diversified revenue streams by segment, product and geography, and 85% of revenues_**
**_are in euro or pegged to the euro._**

Due to our leading market positions across Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Montenegro, and our position as a pan regional services provider, our business
benefits from geographically-diversified and product portfolio-diversified revenue streams, which was
further increased following the Wind Hellas Acquisition. In terms of geographic diversity, the chart
below presents the percentage of revenue derived by jurisdiction (as a percentage of gross revenue,
excluding intercompany revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, both before and after
giving effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, the Optima Telekom Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting
Group Acquisition and other smaller acquisitions:

figures for Nova BG, Danas, Vesnik Telegraf, Net1, N3, D-Express, Mainstream (IT4BIZ d.o.o.), Networx and
Tessa Energy for the period prior to their acquisition by us are based on management accounts.

In addition to geographic diversification, we also benefit from revenue diversification due to the broad
range of product and services that we offer, including cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet
and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services. The chart below presents the percentage of revenue
derived by product (as a percentage of gross revenue, excluding intercompany revenue) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition:

We also benefit from a currency mix that sees 85% of our revenues generated in euros (88% of after
giving full-year effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition) or in geographies where the currency is pegged
to the euro in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which is a significant increase compared to
a currency mix of 73% of our gross revenues generated in euros or in geographies where the currency
is pegged to the euro in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

**_We have a large infrastructure portfolio of fiber, cable TV and mobile networks, that is advanced,_**
**_well-invested and with a broad reach across the region._**

We strive to be the most advanced media and telecommunications company in Southeastern Europe
and we believe that our fiber, mobile and cable TV infrastructure allows us to provide higher quality
digital TV, high-speed broadband and fixed-line telephony and mobile telephony than other operators
in our markets. Our network is well invested and has a relatively low cost to upgrade. In March 2021,
we announced an investment of more than €500 million over the next five years to extend our fiber
network into new areas and upgrade the existing network with 10 Gbps-enabled infrastructure based on
XGS-PON.

We operate the largest fiber network in the region across metropolitan areas in Southern Europe,
extending for approximately 50,000 kilometers. In Bulgaria, we operate the largest Fiber to the ×
(“FTTx”) network, which covers more than 1.3 million homes passed as of September 30, 2021 with
symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 10 Gbps. Together with the VDSL network, our


-----

broadband network covers more than 1.8 million homes passed as of September 30, 2021, which
represent approximately 64% of homes in Bulgaria. In Greece, Wind Hellas is one of the major fiber
operators with a nationwide network of more than 3,000 kilometers and close to half a million homes
passed as of September 30, 2021 through a mix of fiber to the home (FttH) and fiber to the cabinet
(FttC) networks. We see significant further growth opportunity in FttH networks in the underpenetrated
Greek market where we have a dedicated rollout platform and wholesale team in place. In Croatia,
Optima Telekom has a nationwide optical fiber network over 3,000 kilometers and covers over half a
million homes passed as of September 30, 2021. We plan to invest €100 million in the coming years to
further upgrade our network in Croatia.

We also operate an advanced proprietary hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) network which is fully bidirectional and EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled, covering all of our homes passed in Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Montenegro, and approximately 99% of homes passed in Slovenia as of September
30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, our cable network covers approximately 1.8 million homes passed,
and 94% of our core network was DOCSIS 3.1 ready. In addition, our network has an average homes
passed per fiber optics node ratio in the range of approximately 242, 206 and 219 across Slovenia,
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively, which we believe is unrivalled in Southeastern Europe
and compares favourably to other European cable operators.

We also believe our average recorded download speed is consistently faster than those of our main
broadband competitors. In particular, we believe it is 1.7x faster in Serbia, 3.3x faster in Slovenia, 3.9x
faster in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 1.2x faster in Bulgaria.

We have nationwide mobile networks in Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece and Slovenia, where we own
approximately 4,700 towers, including both passive and active equipment, and have spectrum across
2G, 3G, 4G and 5G bands. Our mobile network covers the majority of the population in each of our
countries of operations through our extensive 2G/3G/4G networks, and at present we have the capability
to provide 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99 % and 98%, respectively, of the
Slovenian population, approximately 100% and 98%, respectively, of the Bulgarian population,
approximately 99% and 96%, respectively, of the Croatian population. Following the completion of the
Wind Hellas Acquisition, we will have the capability to provide 4G (LTE) coverage to approximately
98% of the Greek population. To further develop our networks, we have successfully tested and are
rolling out next generation 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. We were the first mobile
operator to have launched 5G services in Slovenia in 2021 and our mobile network in Bulgaria was
named the fastest mobile in Europe by Ookla in both 2020 and 2021.

**_Our low churn rates demonstrate our loyal customer base and differentiated proposition._**

Our business model is attractive and resilient. We believe our portfolio of must-have products and our
superior offering have resulted in a growing and loyal customer base with relatively low churn rates of
approximately 9-11% per annum, combined with the ability to up sell and cross-sell products. Our
customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their everyday
lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient
to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For
example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in
providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study
remotely and spend significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our
voice and data traffic. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer superior
products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than our competitors. Customer loyalty is
evidenced by our relatively low historical churn rates, which is defined as the percentage of customers
that no longer subscribe for a certain service compared to the average number of customers in a
particular month. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our unique cable subscriber churn
rate annualized was 10%, which is below recent reported cable subscriber churn rates of certain Western
European peers. We believe our relatively low churn rates provide, among other benefits, recurring cash


-----

flows and visibility with respect to future revenue. Moreover, these churn rates have persisted
notwithstanding regular price increases.

**_We have a strong track record of profitable growth driven by structurally attractive markets, cross-_**
**_selling opportunities and the successful integration of acquired assets._**

We have a strong track record of profitable growth, underpinned by relatively low penetration rates in
the markets in which we operate and cross-selling opportunities due to our scale, as well as a record of
successfully integrating acquisitions. We operate most of our business across countries in Southeastern
Europe that have relatively low penetration rates in Pay-TV and broadband, which we can capitalize on
via cross-selling due to our scale and comprehensive offering portfolio. As of September 30, 2021, our
Pay-TV penetration of homes passed and broadband internet were 61% and 89%, respectively, in
Slovenia, 63% and 74%, respectively, in Serbia, and 61% and 83%, respectively in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ Pay-TV and NGA fiber penetration in LLU &
NGA fiber base were 11% and 44%, respectively, in Greece. In addition, due to historically strong
regulatory constraints on bundling Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services, RGUs per cable
subscriber ratios in our key markets have lagged behind CEE and Western European cable markets. We
believe this demonstrates that there are strong opportunities to continue to utilize up selling and crossselling opportunities to grow our cable RGUs per subscriber ratio. The following table shows
comparisons of RGUs per cable subscriber in certain key CEE and Western European markets with
those of certain other industry members:

___________________________

_Source: Public company filings. As of September 30, 2021, for United Group, Telenet and Euskaltel and as of June 30, 2018_
_for the other industry peers. The methodologies used to calculate and report RGUs and RGUs per cable subscriber by certain_
_other industry members may vary._

Leveraging our extensive cable infrastructure, we use our high-quality Pay-TV content as a basis to
cross and up sell our broadband internet and telephony products to existing cable Pay-TV customers
and offer multi-play packages to new customers. This has allowed us to steadily improve penetration
rates as customers increasingly focus on the convenience of receiving their multimedia and
communications services in a bundled offer from one provider. For example, we have been able to
increase the number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia from 1% in April 2015 to 40% as of
September 30, 2021. While Pay-TV penetration in all of our markets has been growing, it is still below
the levels of some Western European cable markets, which we believe continues to offer significant
growth opportunities.


-----

In addition to organic growth, we have successfully completed and integrated a large number of targeted
and value accretive investments and acquisitions of attractive cable and mobile assets, such as Vivacom,
Nova, Nova BG and Tele2 Croatia. For example, since our acquisition of Telemach Slovenia in 2009,
our Slovenia Group segment tripled blended cable ARPU (from €13 in 2008, to €35.4 in 2020) and UG
Adjusted EBITDA (from €24 million in 2008, to €89.4 million in 2020) and the Group grew revenue
from €46 million in 2008 to €1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. This was achieved
through both organic growth and the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, which provided us with an
opportunity to create a fully convergent telecom operator in Slovenia. More recently, we have
successfully integrated Vivacom into our Group and have accelerated its growth trajectory by launching
our industry leading OTT platform EON as well as unlimited mobile tariff plans to support growth in
the mobile business, by making further network investments and refreshing the Vivacom brand. As a
result, in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Vivacom’s total revenue increased by 5.4%
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Over the same period, Vivacom’s blended
cable ARPU increased by 4.9% to €9.7 from €9.2, mobile ARPU increased by 5.8% to €7.3 from €6.9,
and DTH ARPU increased by 5.0% to €8.4 from €8.0. We believe our strong track record of integrating
acquisitions benefits us as we acquire and integrate Wind Hellas.

**_We benefit from a highly experienced management team with a proven track record and significant_**
**_investment in the business._**

We have leveraged the significant industry experience and corporate background of our senior
management team to successfully expand our business from being a single country Pay-TV operator to
being a telecommunications and media services leader in Southeastern Europe, through bolt on
acquisitions, integration of cable assets and content companies and organic growth. Many of our key
management members have been with the business since its inception, including our founder and
chairman of our advisory board, Dragan Šolak; chief executive officer and group vice president of
marketing and media, Victoriya Boklag; and group vice president of operations, Violeta Vasilijević.
Our senior management team also includes Janez Živko, group vice president of finance, who joined in
March 2015 and had previously served as the chief financial officer of the Petrol Group, one of the
largest companies in Slovenia; Vladislav Ratajac, group vice president of corporate development, joined
management in 2011, having previously held positions at Mid Europa Partners and Deutsche Bank;
Željko Batistić, group vice president of technology who joined the group in 2012 as CEO of Telemach
Bosnia and prior to that held a number of technical and operational management positions in the
industry; and Dragica Pilipović Chaffey, group vice president of corporate affairs, joined the
management team in 2009 and had previously held a number of senior posts in the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Many members of our senior management team, including our
founder, have each held different positions within our business and have shaped the direction of our
development and growth within Southeastern Europe. In addition, certain members of management
hold significant equity stakes in the business, which amount to approximately 42%. See “Principal
_Shareholders.”_

We also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of BC
Partners. BC Partners has strong telecommunications expertise and an extensive and successful track
record of investing in companies in Europe and in the telecommunications and information sectors.

**Strategy**

We aim to strengthen our telecommunications and media leadership positions in Southeastern Europe,
deliver exceptional revenue growth across segments and capitalize on operating leverage and continued
operating efficiencies to deliver strong profitability and cash flow generation, all while providing our
customers the best products and services in each of our segments and markets. In order to achieve these
goals, we have identified the following strategic pillars:

**_Continued focus on our competitive market positions by leveraging our advanced network,_**
**_differentiated content offerings and loyal customer base._**


-----

We are the leading multi-play provider in Southeastern Europe and hold leadership positions across
each of our countries of operations and product categories. We have achieved these competitive market
positions over the years and we aim to maintain and strengthen them going forward and to further
develop our business in attractive markets in Southeastern Europe. In order to achieve this, we intend
to continue to expand the coverage and capacity of our superior next generation infrastructure in our
footprint, including 5G capability, where the return on investment is appropriate. We also intend to
continue to offer our loyal customer base the most attractive and differentiated content offerings in the
region, with better content choice, speed, functionality and service quality compared to our competitors,
at prices that allow us to deliver compelling value.

**_Increase service penetration across the region by cross-selling products and services and up selling_**
**_value adding products to existing customers._**

We intend to continue to focus on pursuing subscriber growth opportunities in our relatively underpenetrated markets. Over time, we expect our businesses in Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and Bosnia and
Herzegovina to converge with Slovenia in terms of broadband and Pay-TV penetration as well as in
service penetration (measured by RGU per subscriber). To achieve this, we aim to increase triple play
(and in the case of Slovenia and Bulgaria, quad-play) penetration and reduce churn rates by continuing
to shift focus in marketing and subscriber interactions from single services to bundled services. We
intend to continue to promote our bundled services by further leveraging our high-quality network and
utilizing our next generation digital television services, attractive local content and high-speed
broadband services and, where applicable, mobile-telephony services. We plan to offer more add-on
products and incentivize longer term contracts by offering better pricing and subsidies for certain
products. We also aim to capitalize on our superior high-speed broadband capabilities to increase
revenue. Specifically, we intend to continue migrating our existing high-speed broadband subscribers
to higher speeds, which we believe will further support broadband ARPU growth and reduce residential
subscriber churn rates. Following the Wind Hellas Acquisition, we intend to leverage the combination
with our existing Greek pay-TV provider NOVA to seize significant cross-selling, bundling and pricing
optimization opportunities in Greece.

**_Continue to consolidate our position as the leading media company in Southeastern Europe._**

Since inception, our media strategy has been centered on differentiating our offering by producing
superior and/or exclusive Pay-TV channels for our customers. We have applied this philosophy to all
of our Group companies with great success, and we have created an attractive portfolio of full format
national as well as specialized, thematic Pay-TV channels that we believe are a must-have on all
regional distribution platforms. Following the acquisition of Vivacom, Nova BG and Nova and their
integration into our operations, we are applying this philosophy in Bulgaria and Greece. We intend to
consolidate our leadership in Southeastern Europe and continue to grow our content offering by further
developing our portfolio of owned content, entering into strategic partnerships with third-party content
owners and acquiring other content owners in the region, as in the past with the acquisition of Nova TV
Croatia and Direct Media/Pink.

**_Further expand our addressable market by utilizing our OTT platform and attractive content._**

Leveraging our strong brands and our attractive content, we intend to continue to develop our two OTT
content platforms, our regional OTT platform, EON, and our international OTT platform, NetTV Plus,
to further expand our addressable market to areas outside our cable footprint. While our DTH Pay-TV
platform aims to deliver our content to subscribers in rural areas in our markets without cable
infrastructure, our regional OTT platform enables customers in metropolitan areas outside of our cable
footprint, who have subscribed to the broadband internet services of our competitors, to access our
attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels and unique user interface and customer experience.
Additionally, NetTV Plus allows us to provide over 200 local language channels showing ethnic content
to the entire ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. By expanding our geographic reach to customers
in countries in Western Europe and North America, we believe that we are well positioned to further


-----

increase our RGU base and earnings potential. We have a plan to further invest in our in-house software
development of customer premises equipment for our TV and broadband services. With a unified
software solution, we will be able to provide all our service through a unified TV Box or broadband
gateway to any type of networks (OTT, Fiber, Cable or Mobile). We also plan to start developing a new
generation of digital streaming social applications, based on automated content, personalization and
advanced targeted advertising solutions. In addition, we have recently started the in-house development
of artificial intelligence engine software solutions, with dedicated teams who will develop machine
learning models for our content production, content recommendation system and advertisement
solutions.

**_Continued focus on innovation._**

We seek to continue innovating and enhancing our product offering to offer our customers an improved
use experience across our products, further strengthen our leading position across our countries of
operation and enter new markets. Our centralized in-house technology innovation and software
development center, United.Cloud, enables us to focus on leading the introduction of cutting-edge
television and broadband internet services and solutions such as EON (our next generation video
delivery platform which allows customers to watch their favorite channels on a broad range of devices),
UNIFON (our proprietary VoIP application connecting customers’ fixed-line telephones outside of their
homes), our self-help application, enhanced TV features such as VoD and CatchUp TV services and
many others. We also intend to continue promoting the digitalization of internal and external processes
to improve customer satisfaction and profitability. In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the
broadband and Pay-TV markets to launch Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping
platform. We intend for Shoppster to continue delivering the simple, reliable and secure e-shopping
experience that modern consumers expect.

**_Continue to grow our customer base and operations through value accretive acquisitions and_**
**_optimize our portfolio._**

We have a successful track record of making acquisitions on attractive terms and successfully
integrating those acquisitions. Between 2011 and September 30, 2021, we have acquired and integrated
(or are in the process of integrating) approximately 50 cable TV operators, content platforms, media
companies, mobile service providers, B2B service providers and internet service providers (“ISPs”) in
Southeastern Europe. Most recently, we have expanded our addressable market through the acquisition
of Vivacom and Nova Broadcasting in Bulgaria, Nova and, pending completion, Wind Hellas in Greece
and Optima Telekom in Croatia, as well as various other recent acquisitions. As a result, we have
significantly improved our business profile in terms of scale, geographic exposure and currency mix
and product diversification. Our acquisition strategy consists of expanding our scale in a value accretive
manner, enhancing our content offering, expanding our fixed-line and mobile-telephony operations and
leveraging our experience and successful acquisition history to continue to integrate businesses and
generate additional value by increasing scale and product offerings.

The Wind Hellas Acquisition provides us with the opportunity to increase our penetration into the Greek
market following our acquisition of Nova in 2020, increasing our scale and leadership across
Southeastern Europe, further diversifying our revenue streams and improving our currency mix, while
also providing significant upside arising from our strength in cross-selling, bundling and pricing
optimization. We intend to leverage our know-how arising from our highly successful acquisition track
record to successfully integrate Wind Hellas and realize its upside potential. As part of our integration
plan, we intend to combine Wind Hellas with our existing Greek pay-TV provider NOVA to develop a
quad-play market challenger operator, and the number two player in Greece in both broadband internet
and television services. We believe this combination will enable us to deliver a higher value to our
customers in the Greek market by providing a broad range of new technologies and superior services.

Going forward, we plan to continue to make value accretive acquisitions at attractive multiples to
integrate regional service providers, cable assets and fixed-line and mobile-telephony operators into the


-----

business. We intend to continue taking a disciplined approach to acquisitions by assessing individual
opportunities as and when they arise on the basis of merit, ability to integrate assets into our existing
business plans and potential for value creation.

While we continue to grow our business, we also continue to assess opportunities to optimize our
portfolio of assets and maximize value for our stakeholders as those opportunities arise. To that end,
we have taken initial steps to explore a possible sale of our mobile tower portfolios in Bulgaria, Slovenia
and Croatia. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not begun a sale process, identified
a buyer or determined any price or other terms for such a transaction. We currently do not have a
definitive timeline or commitment for any such sale, and we could decide not to proceed with such a
sale at any time.

**_Continue to focus on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) Matters_**

We and our shareholders recognize that developing a sustainable and responsible business that has a
positive social impact is key to our future success. As we have grown our Group, we have increased
our emphasis on integrating ESG considerations into the key aspects of our operations, including our
decision-making and reporting processes, and we intend to continue to increase our focus on ESG
matters going forward, including by implementing the ESG action plan and roadmap prepared by our
dedicated ESG coordinator in 2020 in consultation with external advisors.

To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we are taking active steps to minimize our
environmental footprint, while also collecting and analyzing Group historical data to set future KPI
targets. We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately make all of our
operations carbon-neutral. We intend to leverage our experience in establishing a solar power plant in
Slovenia in 2019 to look for additional green energy projects which could cover a significant part of
our carbon emission footprint. For example, on November 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of a
majority ownership in Tessa Energy in Bulgaria, which we expect will invest in the Kremena Wind
Park, which has a 70MW capacity and will allow us to significantly decrease our carbon footprint. We
also intend to continue to use electric vehicles in our operations where feasible, and work to exchange
old, less-energy efficient equipment for more energy-efficient devices. In 2020, we generated
approximately 128.1 thousand tons of CO2 emissions (9.3 thousand tons of scope 1 emissions and 118.8
thousand tons of scope 2 and 3 emissions), including the contribution of acquired companies. We intend
to reduce these by approximately 60%, or 50.6 thousand tons, by 2030. In addition, in 2020, we recycled
1,539 tons of network telecom equipment, batteries, cables, paper and cardboard. Our goal going
forward is to continue minimizing waste by repurposing, reusing or recycling 100% of returned
customer devices and accessories.

We support social and economic development in Southern Europe and aim to build the region’s most
advanced digital telecommunications infrastructure. In particular, we intend to invest approximately
one billion euros by the middle of this decade to modernize and expand our network to ensure it can
support the future needs of our customers. In 2020, we named a Group-level director for corporate social
responsibility and we plan to continue actively supporting the communities in which we operate. We
have as a Group donated €4.7 million in 2020 and €1.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2021, to groups and activities dedicated to protecting the environment, education and the socially
vulnerable, including donations of personal protective equipment to help fight COVID-19. We intend
to continue to engage in community engagement activities such as those we have carried out in the past
few years, with a focus on delivering knowledge to children, students, the general public and
disadvantaged groups, by leveraging our core competencies in broadband internet and other
telecommunications. For 2022, we aim to increase the percentage of staff participating in a community
engagement activity (e.g., volunteering time or knowledge), which in 2021 stood at 7% (excluding
United Media).

We focus on building a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees. To inform our
diversity, inclusion and safety targets, we intend to continue collecting data on our workforce, such as


-----

gender mix, percentage of women in management positions and percentage of disabled employees to
set future targets. We also have mandated diversity and inclusion rules, and have documented these in
employee manuals at our Group companies. To facilitate further transparency and accountability, we
plan to expand our anonymous suggestion boxes already present in certain of our Group companies and
establish whistle-blowing programs as a distinct transparency function. We also plan to continue to
offer training programs to employees focused on improving job-related technical and management
skills, as well as on compliance with our internal policies.

**The Transactions**

**_The Wind Hellas Acquisition_**

On August 14, 2021, the Issuer entered into the Wind Hellas Acquisition Agreement with Crystal
Almond Holdings Limited (the “Seller”) to acquire Crystal Almond Midco, an indirect parent of Wind
Hellas Telecommunications S.A., from the Seller for an estimated enterprise value of €980 million,
subject to certain adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Wind Hellas Acquisition Agreement.
The Issuer’s rights under the Wind Hellas Acquisition Agreement were assigned by the Issuer to its
indirect subsidiary NewCo United Group Hellas S.à r.l. pursuant to an assignment agreement. The Wind
Hellas Acquisition was approved by the European Commission on December 21, 2021, and we expect
it to be consummated on or about January 12, 2022. Although the Seller has given certain customary
representations, warranties and indemnities as to, inter alia, capacity, title and disclosure in the Wind
Hellas Acquisition Agreement, the Issuer may not be able to enforce claims against the Seller relating
to breaches of these representations, warranties and indemnities. In addition, the Seller’s liability for
any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Wind Hellas Acquisition—We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of_
_the representations and warranties provided in connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition and our_
_ability to recover losses suffered as a result of such a breach may be limited.”_

Wind Hellas is one of the three integrated communication providers with proprietary mobile and fixedline networks in Greece, a large and attractive EU market with 4.3 million broadband and 14.1 million
mobile subscribers as of December 31, 2020. It offers mobile and fixed-line telecommunication, highspeed internet services and Pay-TV services under a unified brand and on a national basis to over 4.1
million subscribers. As of September 30, 2021, household and business accounts represented
approximately 61% of total RGUs. Wind Hellas owns one of the three proprietary mobile networks in
Greece and is the third-largest mobile provider in Greece, with more than 3.4 million mobile subscribers
as of September 30, 2021. Wind Hellas is also the third-largest fixed-line telephony provider. In
addition, it provides Pay-TV services to residential customers through its video platform, Wind Vision,
which it launched in April 2018 and had 0.1 million platform subscribers as of September 30, 2021.

Established in 1992 as STET Hellas, Wind Hellas was acquired by Weather Investments S.p.A. in 2007
and was renamed as Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. Since then, it has operated under the
licensed brand name “WIND.” Over the years, Wind Hellas became a well-diversified and resilient
operator and increased its market share. In particular, following the addition of fixed-line
telecommunications in 2008 through the acquisition of Tellas Telecommunications S.A., it became a
leading integrated telecommunications provider. In 2015, Wind Hellas started its LTE roll-out plan, and
in 2018, it launched its video platform, Wind Vision. Wind Hellas benefits from an extensive
nationwide fiber optic network of approximately 6,162 kilometers (backbone and metropolitan access
network) and approximately 600 kilometers of fiber as part of the recently commenced NGA
deployment. Wind Hellas continuously invests in its network to support growth initiatives and enhance
its service offering. It also accelerated investments in digital service capability to take advantage of
emerging consumer behaviour patterns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020,
Wind Hellas acquired 5G spectrum, which represented a significant milestone and laid the foundation
for deploying its 5G network roll-out while providing visibility on future license payments for seven
years starting from January 2024. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas achieved 4G and 5G network


-----

coverage of 98% and 24%, respectively, of the 10.7 million population in Greece and continued
investing in its fiber network, reaching 431 thousand NGA lines deployed.

Wind Hellas has successfully scaled in the market over the past few years and has achieved solid growth
and financial performance in recent years, with strong growth in key metrics such as the gross margins
for its mobile and fixed-line services and operating expense optimization, as well as profitability and
cash flow generation. Wind Hellas’ total revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was
€558.3 million compared to €537.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Its WH Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €248.5 million compared to €245.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Wind Hellas’ operating performance has been similarly
strong, with increases in ARPU and subscriber numbers. For the twelve months ended September 30,
2021, mobile ARPU increased to €11.4 per one million active customers from €11.2 per one million
active customers for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 2%. As of September 30, 2021,
mobile subscribers were 3.4 million and LLU & NGA Fiber subscribers were 0.6 million. Fixed-line
ARPU (including Wind Vision) was €21.0 per one million active customers for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 compared to €20.9 per one million active customers for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

We believe the Wind Hellas Acquisition provides us with the opportunity to increase our penetration
into the Greek market following our acquisition of Nova in 2020, increasing our scale and leadership
across Southeastern Europe, further diversifying our revenue streams and improving our currency mix,
while also providing significant upside arising from our strength in cross-selling, bundling and pricing
optimization. We intend to leverage our know-how arising from our highly successful acquisition track
record to successfully integrate Wind Hellas and realize its upside potential. As part of our integration
plan, we intend to combine Wind Hellas with our existing Greek pay-TV provider NOVA to develop a
quad-play market challenger operator, and the number two player in Greece in both broadband internet
and television services. We believe this combination will enable us to deliver a higher value to our
customers in the Greek market by providing a broad range of new technologies and superior services.
In particular, we believe we can significantly improve Wind Hellas’ performance by accelerating
growth in its mobile post-paid revenues through cross-selling into Nova-subscribing households,
accelerating growth in its fixed broadband revenues leveraging on Nova’s leading entertainment offer,
growing its subscriber base, accelerating its fiber roll-out, and growing its wholesale revenues on the
back of fiber infrastructure rental.

On or about the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, FiberCo, a newly established and separate
subsidiary of Crystal Almond Midco holding Wind Hellas’ fiber network business, and the Victus Joint
Operation, the 50/50 joint operation between Wind Hellas and Vodafone-Panafon S.A., a member of
Vodafone Group plc, are expected to be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the existing
Indentures and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and therefore not to be subject to the covenants
therein. In addition, FiberCo and the Joint Victus Operation will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the
SSN Indenture and will not be subject to the covenants included therein.

**_The Financing of the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the Wind Hellas Indebtedness Refinancing_**

In connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition, on January 7, 2022, the Issuer entered into the Senior
Secured Bridge Facility Agreement, which provides for the €630 million Senior Secured Fixed Rate

**Recent Developments**

**_COVID-19 Impact on Revenues and UG Adjusted EBITDA_**

Based on our analysis, we estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic had a minimal impact of
approximately 1-2% on organic consolidated revenues during 2020 as compared to 2019. We estimate
that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was even
lower, with no material effects on our operations. The revenue streams most negatively affected in 2020
include advertising, media selling and mobile handsets sales. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in
March 2020, we implemented cost optimization initiatives and managed our capital expenditure plans


-----

in response to the pandemic, but we did so in a way that would not hinder our ability to achieve future
growth or adversely impact the quality of services provided.

Our telecommunications segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and
our network operating centers have maintained normal service levels. Based on this, no significant
change in our customer base occurred. As customers were unlikely or unable to easily migrate during
the crisis, in 2020 we experienced somewhat lower gross additions and churn rates, with our operations
normalizing during 2021. Organic revenues and UG Adjusted EBITDA in our telecommunications
segment remained stable during 2020 compared to the previous year.

During the first waves of lockdowns imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic between March
and May 2020, as an increasing number of people began to work or study remotely and spend significant
amounts of time at home, we saw a significant increase in our voice and data traffic. In particular, over
this period, our fixed data traffic increased at rates between 50% and 70%, while fixed voice traffic
increased at rates between 50% and 85%, depending on the country. In addition, our mobile data and
voice traffic increased at rates between 30% and 40%, depending on the country. To accommodate such
higher customer demand, we increased capacity on network elements and interconnections.

In our Media segment, we estimate that organic revenue in the segment declined by approximately 56% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the previous year. This decline was due in part
to the postponement of certain sporting events and a decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by
a decline in relevant costs. Overall, supported by cost optimization efforts, UG Adjusted EBITDA in
the Media segment remained broadly stable year on year prior to giving effect to the Nova Broadcasting
Group Acquisition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we have seen levels of organic
advertising increasing and surpassing pre-COVID levels.

Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to grow the Group through acquisitions, completing the
acquisitions of Tele2 Croatia (completed in March 2020), Vivacom (completed in July 2020), Nova
(completed in November 2020) and Nova BG (completed in January 2021). The impact of COVID-19
on these acquired companies is similar to that of the Group’s existing telecommunications operations.
The expected contribution of the acquired companies has not materially changed given the crisis and
all such acquired companies are performing in line with or above our expectations.

**_Recent Trading_**

_United Group_

Based on preliminary results from our unaudited management accounts for the two-month period ended
November 30, 2021, and other information currently available, we estimate that our revenue for the
two-month period ended November 30, 2021 will be between €337.5 million and €341.5 million,
compared to €276.6 million for the corresponding period of 2020. Estimated revenue of United Group
increased compared to the prior-year period due to organic growth as well as due to the Nova
Acquisition and the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition, which were not included in such prior-year
period. We estimate that UG EBITDA for United Group for the two-month period ended November 30,
2021 (excluding any adjustments), will be between €128.0 million and €132.0 million, compared to
€109.2 million for the same period in 2020.

_Wind Hellas_

Based on preliminary results from Wind Hellas’ unaudited management accounts for the two-month
period ended November 30, 2021, and other information currently available, Wind Hellas estimates that
its WH Service Revenue for the two-month period ended November 30, 2021 will be between €89.0
million and €90.0 million, compared to €84.6 million for the corresponding period of 2020. Estimated
WH Service Revenue increased compared to the prior-year period due to higher retail customer base,
increased take-up of its wholesale NGA offering and increased number of visitors. Wind Hellas


-----

estimates that its WH EBITDA for the two-month period ended November 30, 2021 (excluding any
adjustments), will be between €38.0 million and €39.0 million compared to €35.8 million for the same
period in 2020.

available.

**Ranking of the Senior Secured Notes ..........** The Senior Secured Notes will:

                                  - be senior obligations of the Issuer, secured
by the Collateral described below under “—
_Security for the Senior Secured Notes” on a_
first-priority basis (subject to certain

exceptions) along with obligations under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility

Agreement (although any liabilities in
respect of obligations under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will,
and certain future hedging agreements and
certain other indebtedness that is secured by
the Collateral may, receive priority over the
Senior Secured Notes with respect to any
proceeds received upon any enforcement
action over the Collateral);

                                  - be senior in right of payment to any
indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the
Senior Secured Notes;

                                  - be effectively senior in right of payment to
any existing or future unsecured obligations
of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral that is available to satisfy the
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes;

                                  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or
future indebtedness of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries that is secured by property and
assets that do not secure the Senior Secured
Notes, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such

indebtedness; and

                                  - be structurally subordinated to any existing
or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of
the Issuer that are not Guarantors.

**SSN Guarantees ............................................** Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed (the
“SSN Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis (i)
on the Issue Date by the Company, (ii) within 120
days following (and not including) the Issue
Date, by the Existing Subsidiary Guarantors and
(iii) within 180 days following (and not
including) the Issue Date, by the Wind Hellas
Guarantor. The validity and enforceability of the


-----

SSN Guarantees will be subject to significant
limitations. In particular, the SSN Guarantee by
the Wind Hellas Guarantor will be limited to the
proceeds of the Bridge Facilities that were used
for the Wind Hellas Indebtedness Refinancing
with certain Greek law limitations, in each case,
as described in “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the_
_Security_ _Interests.”_ The Guarantors also

guarantee (or will guarantee) the obligations
under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.
The Existing Revolving Credit Facility also
benefits from guarantees from certain entities
organized in Serbia and from security interests
over assets located in Serbia and Croatia.

For the nine months ended as of September 30,
2021, (i) the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding
the Target Group) generated 44% of the
Company’s consolidated revenue and 59% of the
Company’s consolidated UG EBITDA, (ii) the
Company’s subsidiaries (including the Issuer and
the Guarantors, but excluding the Target Group)
had a profit for the period of €34 million,
compared to a consolidated net loss of €62
million for the Company and (iii) the Issuer and
the Guarantors (excluding the Target Group)
represented 43% of the Company’s consolidated
total assets (excluding goodwill).

Following the Issue Date, the Wind Hellas
Guarantor is expected to accede to the SSN
Indenture as Guarantors. For the nine months
ended and as of September 30, 2021, the Wind
Hellas Guarantor comprised substantially all of
the WH EBITDA and gross assets of Wind
Hellas. However, the SSN Guarantee granted by
the Wind Hellas Guarantor is expected to be
limited to the amount of the proceeds from the
Bridge Facilities that were provided to Wind
Hellas in connection with the Wind Hellas
Indebtedness Refinancing, in addition to other
limitations under applicable law. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

**Ranking of the SSN Guarantees ..................** Each SSN Guarantee will, upon the relevant
Guarantor having entered into such SSN
Guarantee:

                                  - be the senior obligations of the relevant
Guarantor, which will be secured by the
Collateral described below under “—Security
_for the Senior Secured Notes” on a first-_


-----

priority basis (subject to certain exceptions)
along with obligations under the Existing
Senior Secured Notes and the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

(although any liabilities in respect of
obligations under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement will, and certain
future hedging agreements and other

indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral
may, receive priority over the SSN
Guarantees with respect to any proceeds
received upon any enforcement action over
the Collateral);

- be senior in right of payment to any
indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the SSN Guarantee;

- be effectively senior in right of payment to
any existing or future unsecured obligations
of the relevant Guarantor, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral that is available to
satisfy the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes;

- be senior in right of payment to any existing
or future obligations of the relevant
Guarantor secured on a basis junior to the
Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral that is available to
satisfy the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or
future indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor
that is secured by property and assets that do
not secure the SSN Guarantee to the extent
of the value of the property and assets
securing such indebtedness; and

- be subject to the limitations described herein.

The validity and enforceability of the SSN
Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to significant limitations, as
described in “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests.” The SSN Guarantees will be_
subject to release under certain circumstances.
See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_SSN Guarantees.”_

In addition, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, certain perfection requirements and
any Permitted Collateral Liens, on the date that is
120 days following (and not including) the Issue

Guarantees are expected to be secured by the

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
perfection requirements and any Permitted
Collateral Liens, within 120 days following (and
not including) the Issue Date, the Senior Secured
Notes and the SSN Guarantees are also expected
to be secured by security over the shares of each


-----

BTC (together, the “Vivacom Collateral”).

The Initial Collateral, the Post-Closing Collateral
and the Vivacom Collateral, together with any
and all other assets from time to time in which a
security interest has been or will be granted
pursuant to any security document to secure
obligations under the SSN Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes, is collectively referred to
herein as the “Collateral,” and such security
documents pursuant to which security has been
granted to secure obligations under the SSN
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, are
collectively referred to herein as the “Security
Documents.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets
will not be pledged (or the liens not perfected) in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles,
as described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes— Security—The Collateral.”_

**Use of Proceeds ..............................................** The proceeds of the Offering, together with cash
on hand, will be used to repay in full and cancel
the indebtedness expected to be incurred under
the Bridge Facilities, including accrued interest
thereon, and to pay fees and expenses in
connection with the Offering. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

**Additional Amounts ......................................** All payments the Issuer or any Guarantor makes
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be
made without withholding or deduction for taxes
unless required by applicable law. If withholding
or deduction for such taxes is required by law to
be made in any “relevant taxing jurisdiction”
with respect to a payment on the Senior Secured
Notes, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor will pay the additional
amounts necessary so that the net amount
received by the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes after the withholding or deduction is not
less than the amount that they would have
received in the absence of such withholding or
deduction. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

**Optional Redemption of the Senior Secured**
**Notes:**

Fixed Rate SSNs ............................................. Prior to, 2025, the Issuer will be entitled at
its option to redeem all or a portion of the Senior
Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate


-----

SSNs, plus the applicable “make-whole”

premium described in this offering memorandum
and accrued and unpaid interest to (but not
including) the redemption date.

At any time prior to, 2025, the Issuer may
on one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate
SSNs, using the net proceeds from certain equity
offerings at a redemption price equal to %
of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate SSNs,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of
redemption; _provided that at least 50% of the_
original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed
Rate SSNs (excluding the principal amount of
any additional notes) remains outstanding after
the redemption (unless all Fixed Rate SSNs are
redeemed substantially concurrently).

In addition, prior to, 2025, the Issuer may
redeem during each calendar year up to 10% of
the original principal amount of the Fixed Rate
SSNs (calculated after giving effect to the
issuance of any original principal amount of
additional notes of the same series) at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to (but not
including) the date of redemption.

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed
Rate SSNs at any time on or after, 2025,
at the redemption prices described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid_
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date
(but not including) of redemption.

time, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to
(but not including) the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control .........................................** If the Company experiences a change of control,
as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will have the right to
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to
(but not including) the date of repurchase.
However, a change of control will not be deemed
to have occurred in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes if a specified consolidated net leverage
ratio is not exceeded in connection with such
event. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Certain Covenants ........................................** The Indenture will restrict, among other things,

and

                                  - impair the security interests for the benefit of

_months ended September 30, 2020 from the unaudited pro forma financial data for the year ended_
_December 31, 2020 and adding the unaudited pro forma financial data for the nine months ended_

_pro forma consolidated financial data for the Pro Forma Group, see “Presentation of Financial Data”_
_and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.”_

_The summary unaudited pro forma financial data is based on available information and certain_
_assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited pro forma financial data is_
_presented for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results_
_of operations that we would have reported had the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the Vivacom_
_Transactions actually occurred during the period presented, and the summary unaudited pro forma_
_financial data does not purport to project our results of operations for any future period. The summary_
_unaudited pro forma financial data has not been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation_
_S-X under the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting_
_standards. For more information, please refer to “Presentation of Financial Data” and “Unaudited_
_Pro Forma Financial Information.”_

_We also present below certain unaudited financial data of the Group on a pro forma run-rate basis._
_The unaudited pro forma run-rate financial date adjusts certain financial data derived from the_
_unaudited pro forma financial information presented below for (a) the estimated last two quarters_
_results not yet consolidated into the Group's results for the contribution of Optima Telekom, sourced_
_from its unaudited management accounts, which have been aligned in certain aspects to the Group’s_
_accounting policies; (b) the estimated last two quarters results expected to be generated by Tessa_
_Energy, based on management’s assumptions regarding, among others, its investment in the Kremena_
_Wind Park, as if the acquisition of Tessa Energy and its investment in the Kremena Wind Park was_
_completed on April 1, 2021; (c) (i) the estimated last two quarters results not yet consolidated into the_
_Group’s results for the contribution of Networx, sourced from its unaudited management accounts,_
_which have been aligned in certain aspects to the Group’s accounting policies, (ii) the results of the_
_following companies for the period from April 1, 2021 to the date on which the results of such companies_
_were consolidated with the Group’s results, each of which were acquired during the period: N3,_
_ComNet, D Express and Mainstream, and derived from their respective unaudited management_
_accounts, which might not be fully aligned to the Group’s accounting policies, and (iii) the estimated_
_effect on the last two quarters results derived from certain synergies expected to be generated following_
_the acquisition of Vestnik Telegraf, based on management’s estimates regarding the impact of certain_
_actions and initiatives implemented in connection with this acquisition, as if these actions were_
_implemented on April 1, 2021; (d) the estimated last two quarters results generated by Wind Hellas’_
_fiber network business that was transferred to FiberCo, on January 3, 2022, based on management’s_
_estimates; and (e) the estimated effect on the last two quarters results derived from (i) certain cost_
_savings (primarily in respect of staff costs) expected to be generated from the integration of Wind Hellas_
_and Nova, and (ii) revenue expected to be generated from existing Wind Hellas’ contracts with the_
_Greek government relating to the connectivity procurement program SYZEFXIS II, in each case based_
_on management’s assumptions regarding the impact of actions and initiatives implemented in_
_connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition, as if the Wind Hellas Acquisition was completed, and_
_such actions and initiatives were fully implemented, on April 1, 2021. Where such unaudited pro forma_
_run-rate information is labeled as “Annualized,” we have used data for the last two quarters ended_
_September 30, 2021 and multiplied by two._


-----

_We also present certain other Non-IFRS Measures below, which are listed in “Presentation of_
_Financial Data—Historical Financial Data Included in This Offering Memorandum—Non-IFRS_
_Financial and Operating Data.” These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because_
_we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in the telecommunications industry as a_
_means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure. These measures may_
_not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements_
_under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items_
_as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measures derived in_
_accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other_
_companies. Our management believes this data, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to_
_investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented._
_These measures are used in the internal management of our business, along with the most directly_
_comparable IFRS financial measures, in evaluating the operating performance. Non-IFRS measures_
_have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for_
_analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in the Company Audited_
_Financial Statements, the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, the Wind Hellas Audited_
_Financial Statements or the Wind Hellas Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. For more_
_information, see “Presentation of Financial Data.”_

_Prospective investors should read the summary data presented below in conjunction with “Presentation_

___________________________

(1) Homes passed represents all homes (households) ready to be connected directly to our fixed-line network.


-----

(2) Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of our
cable-based services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is
typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access
and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services,
thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but several RGUs.

(3) Cable Pay-TV RGUs includes (i) the sum of our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Slovenia, (ii) our total
analog cable Pay-TV RGUs (without separately counting analog cable RGUs that have purchased digital top ups) in
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro and (iii) our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Bulgaria.

(4) DTH subscribers represent the number of individuals across Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Greece, Montenegro and North Macedonia who have subscribed to our DTH pay-TV services. We believe most of
these subscribers are outside of our cable footprint. Typically, DTH subscribers are only able to subscribe to DTH
based pay-TV services and represent a single RGU. However, we re-sell ADSL services purchased from our
competitors in the respective markets to DTH subscribers.

(5) OTT consists of our NetTV Plus and out-of-footprint EON subscribers.

(6) Broadband internet RGUs represents residential broadband internet provided within our network footprint.

(7) Fixed-line telephony RGUs represents residential fixed-line telephony provided within our network footprint.

(8) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as
an MNO since our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia
in March 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following the completion of the
acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria.

(9) Out-of-footprint includes multichannel multipoint distribution service-based services, ADSL internet services and
cable services provided outside of our network footprint.

(10) RGU Penetration represents for cable Pay-TV the number of unique cable subscribers at the end of the relevant
period as a percentage of the number of homes passed by our network, and for broadband internet the number of
RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of unique cable subscribers.

(11) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV,
broadband internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding
minor installation fees) for that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that
month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include
mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31,
2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, €10.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and €8.9
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding together, for each month in a
given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of other networks
roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number
of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period.

(12) As of January 1, 2019, we changed our reporting methodology in regards to certain key operating measures, which
has resulted in immaterial differences as compared to previous periods. For the year ended December 31, 2018, OTT
users on our network have been reclassified to Cable and Cable services users on other networks have been
reclassified to Out-of-footprint from Cable. This change has an immaterial effect on all subscriber, RGU, ARPU and
churn data for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such key operating measures have been restated for such
periods in line with this new reporting methodology.

(1) We define UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure as capital expenditure adjusted by programming rights and intragroup
adjustments, assets held for sale, application of IFRS 15 for customer acquisition costs in SBB Serbia and overflow
between periods. We define UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases as UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure,
further adjusted to exclude the impact of right-of-use asset additions and, starting from 2021 the right-of-use asset
modifications and prepayments. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after leases
are prepared based on management accounts and not IFRS. Management believes that excluding these components
provides useful information to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s cash flows and understanding the
performance of our core business described below for each of the periods presented.

The following table provides a reconciliation of Capital expenditure to UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases for the three months ended March 31, 2021, the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and the last two quarters ended September 30, 2021.

(a) Represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of set-top box purchases and
other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labor costs), cable and mobile
network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer hardware and software, as well
as certain programming rights and licenses.

(b) Represents the difference following a change in how we account for programming rights. Until December
31, 2016, our Media Group segment included the total value of license agreements signed for programming
rights with a term longer than one year in its UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure. For the purpose of IFRS,
however, the Group had recognized these programming rights as capital expenditure in the period, only to
the extent of assets available for broadcasting (i.e., one season). Starting from January 1, 2017, our Media
Group segment has followed the Group’s approach. However, as certain programming rights prior to this
date had already been reported as UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure by our Media Group segment, there was
a difference compared to the Group’s capital expenditure for the period. This adjustment has been decreasing
since December 31, 2016 as long-term license agreements (which had previously been reported as UG
Adjusted Capital Expenditure) are expiring.

(c) Represents unrealized profit on the intragroup sale of end-user equipment by SBB Serbia. When SBB Serbia
sells this equipment to other United Group companies in compliance with applicable transfer pricing
requirements, it makes an unrealized profit on the sale. These unrealized profits are eliminated for the
purposes of preparing our accounts in accordance with IFRS, but are not eliminated for the purpose of our
management accounts.

(d) Represents programming rights acquired by our Media Group segment for other Group segments which were
recognized under IFRS as intangible assets and were invoiced to other Group segments after March 31 and
September 30, 2021.

(e) Relates to the fact that our management accounts are closed prior to the closing of our accounts prepared in
accordance with IFRS. Overflow between periods in any given period reflects the additional capital
expenditure incurred between the preparation of our management accounts and our accounts prepared in
accordance with IFRS for such period.

(f) Represents the additional effect of harmonizing our accounting policy with respect to the capitalization of
subscriber acquisition costs for rebinding, upselling and cross-selling (which in the past were not eligible to
be capitalized, but under IFRS 15 qualify for capitalization), which were determined subsequent to the
preparation of our management accounts.

(g) Represents the exclusion of right-of-use asset additions and, starting from 2021 the right-of-use asset
modifications and prepayments.

(2) We define “UG EBITDA” as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income tax (benefit)/expense, depreciation,
amortization of intangible assets and net finance costs and share of profit/loss of an equity-accounted investee.

(3) UG Adjusted EBITDA represents UG EBITDA, adjusted for certain exceptional items, such as shareholder related
costs, impairment charges, M&A related costs and group restructuring costs, which the Group views as nonoperating. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL represents UG Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the impact of
expenses that were capitalized as a result of the implementation of IFRS 16. Management believes that excluding
these components provides useful information to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s operating
performance, financing structure and understanding the performance of our core business described below for each
of the periods presented.

UG EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL are supplemental measures of financial
performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. UG EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDA
and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL are not measurements of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not
consider any of UG EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDA or UG Adjusted EBITDAaL as an alternative to (a) net income
(as determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of our operating performance), (b) cash flow for the period as
a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS.
We present UG EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and the ratios derived therefrom,
because we believe that they are measures commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in
managing our business. UG EBITDA, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL, as presented in this
offering memorandum, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies
due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. See “Presentation of Financial Data—Non-IFRS
_Financial and Operating Data.”_

_________________________

(a) Represents costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Advisory Services Agreement (as defined
herein) and certain other items. The significant level of costs and expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 reflects the increased level of activity during the period related to companies acquired
in 2020 and 2021. For more information regarding the Advisory Services Agreement, see “Related Party
_Transactions—Advisory Services Agreement.”_

(b) Represents expenses incurred in relation to performance of advisory services by the Group management in

with certain customers.

(f) Represents the effect of impairment of contract assets from unbilled revenues based on the best estimates of
management.

(g) Represents impairment of subscriber acquisition costs for terminated contracts.

(h) Represents unrealized profit for the intragroup sale of end user equipment by SBB Serbia, which is not
eliminated for the purpose of our management accounts. When SBB Serbia sells this equipment to other
Group companies in compliance with applicable transfer pricing requirements, it makes an unrealized profit

(i) Represents non-cash charges due to the sale of fixed assets and inventories below book value.

(j) Represents contributions of the Group to protecting the environment, education, the socially vulnerable and
individual donations, including donations of medical equipment to Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and

administrative expenses and fees, non-cash charges due to the sale of fixed assets and inventories below
book value.

(n) Represents the exclusion of the impact of expenses that were capitalized as a result of the implementation of
IFRS 16.

While we adopted IFRS 16 with effect from January 1, 2019, we did not give effect to IFRS 16 in the calculation
of UG Adjusted EBITDA until January 1, 2021. Starting from 2021, we revised the methodology of calculation of
UG Adjusted EBITDA, which now includes the impact from the implementation of IFRS 16. For comparability
purposes, in this offering memorandum we present (i) UG Adjusted EBITDA in line with the revised methodology
(i.e., incorporating IFRS 16 effect) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, and (ii) UG Adjusted EBITDAaL, which is calculated as UG Adjusted
EBITDA excluding the impact of expenses that were capitalized as a result of the implementation of IFRS 16, for
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021. Since
we only adopted IFRS 16 since January 1, 2019, we have not restated any previous historical financial data. As a
result, UG Adjusted EBITDA and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL presented in this offering memorandum for the year
ended December 31, 2018 do not account for the effect from the implementation of IFRS 16, and may not be
directly comparable to the metrics presented for periods after December 31, 2018. For more information, see
“Presentation of Financial Data—Company Segment Reporting.”

_________________________

(1) ARPU (outgoing) is calculated as the sum of Wind Hellas’ outgoing revenue (including voice, data, roaming and
other outgoing revenue) in a relevant period divided by the average number of subscribers in such period. The
average number of subscribers in a given period is calculated as the average number of subscriber in each month
divided by the number of months in such period. The average number of subscribers in a given month is calculated
as the average between the number of subscribers at the beginning of such month and the number of subscribers at
the end of such month. Subscribers for the Mobile ARPU (outgoing) calculation include post-paid mobile and prepaid mobile (one-month active customers) subscribers.

(2) Average monthly data usage per subscriber is calculated as the total traffic consumption in any mobile service for a
given period divided by the average number of subscriber in such period.

(3) Wind Hellas reports the number of subscribers in its mobile business based on the number of SIM cards in use and
not the actual number of individuals or businesses using its services. Subscribers that pay in advance for services to
be delivered are counted as pre-paid mobile subscribers and subscribers that pay periodically through a contractual
agreement are counted as post-paid mobile subscribers. Pre-paid mobile subscribers are counted in Wind Hellas’


-----

subscriber base if they have activated one of its SIM cards in the previous twelve months (for new subscribers) or if
they have recharged their mobile telephone credit in the last twelve months and have not requested that their SIM
card be deactivated and have not switched to another telecommunications operator via mobile number portability
during this period (for its existing mobile subscribers), unless fraudulent activity has occurred. Post-paid mobile
subscribers are counted in Wind Hellas’ subscriber base if they have an active contract unless their SIM card is
deactivated upon their request or because fraudulent activity has occurred. Wind Hellas reports the number of
subscribers in its fixed-line business, based upon LLU & NGA. LLU & NGA subscribers are counted in Wind
Hellas’ subscriber base if they have an active contract. Any active LLU and NGA customer with a simultaneous
active Wind Vision contract is considered as a Wind Vision subscriber in Wind Hellas’ subscriber base.

(1) WH Service Revenue is prepared by Wind Hellas’ management and differs from total revenue as presented in Wind
Hellas’ historical financial information. WH Service Revenue refers to gross revenue from services excluding
discounts and revenues from sale of handsets and accessories. WH Service Revenue is used in the internal
management of Wind Hellas’ business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, in
evaluating operating performance. Wind Hellas’ management believes WH Service Revenue is useful to investors
because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. The following table
provides a reconciliation of revenue as reported in Wind Hellas’ consolidated financial statements to WH Service
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the last two

_________________________

(a) Mobile revenue represents outgoing mobile revenues net of discounts.

(b) Fixed-line revenue represents LLU, NGA and Wind Vision revenues.

(c) Wholesale revenues include voice revenue of transit services, other wholesale revenue and revenue from
international roaming.

(d) Interconnection traffic relates to incoming revenues.

(e) Refers to discounts provided to wholesalers and franchisees for prepaid scratch cards.

(2) WH EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDAaL and WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage
Towers Disposal are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS. Wind Hellas defines “WH EBITDA” as net income gain / (loss) for the period plus income
tax (expense) benefit, net finance costs and depreciation and amortization. Wind Hellas defines “WH Adjusted
EBITDA” as WH EBITDA adjusted for certain exceptional items, such as indemnities, stock option incentive plans,
professional fees, and gain on loss of control of subsidiary/gain on sale of investment held for sale, which are
attributable to specific projects or transactions that have occurred in the relevant period. Wind Hellas defines “WH
Adjusted EBITDAaL” as WH Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude the impact of expenses that were capitalized
as a result of the implementation of IFRS 16. Wind Hellas defines “WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage
Towers Disposal” as WH Adjusted EBITDAaL after giving pro-forma effect to the Vantage Tower Disposal as if it
had occurred on January 1, 2020, as calculated in Wind Hellas’ management accounts.

WH EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDAaL and WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage
Towers Disposal are not measurements of performance under IFRS and WH EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDA, WH
Adjusted EBITDAaL and WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage Towers Disposal should not be considered
alternatives to (a) operating income or net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of operating
performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of ability to meet cash
needs or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. WH EBITDA, WH
Adjusted EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDAaL and WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage Towers Disposal and
similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect
the circumstances of those companies. Caution should be exercised in comparing WH EBITDA, WH Adjusted
EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDAaL and WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage Towers Disposal as reported by
Wind Hellas to similar measures of other companies.

The following table provides a reconciliation of WH EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDA, WH Adjusted EBITDAaL
and WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage Towers Disposal to total net income gain / (loss) for the three months
ended March 31, 2021, the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the last two quarters ended September 30,

(1) We define “Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases” as capital expenditure adjusted by programming
rights and intragroup adjustments, assets held for sale, application of IFRS 15 for customer acquisition costs in SBB
Serbia and overflow between periods, as further adjusted to exclude the right-of-use asset additions and, starting
from 2021 the right-of-use asset modifications and prepayments. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after
Leases is prepared based on management accounts and not IFRS.

(2) Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are supplemental measures
of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are not a measurement of performance or liquidity
under IFRS and you should not consider Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDAaL as an alternative to (a) pro forma net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of
our operating performance), (b) pro forma cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash
needs, or (c) any other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL and the ratios derived therefrom, because we believe that
they are measures commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing our business. Pro
Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL, as presented in this offering
memorandum, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to
differences in the way these measures are calculated. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Data—Non-IFRS Financial
_and Operating Data.’’_

We define “Pro Forma EBITDA” as pro forma profit/(loss) for the period, _plus pro forma income tax_
(benefit)/expense, pro forma depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and pro forma net finance costs. The
following table provides a reconciliation of pro forma profit/(loss) for the period to Pro Forma EBITDA for the year
ended December 31, 2020, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 and for the last two quarters
ended September 30, 2021.

quarters ended September 30, 2021.

(b) Represents estimated last two quarters Adjusted EBITDAaL not yet consolidated into the Group’s results for the
contribution of Optima Telekom, which has been derived from its unaudited management accounts, and which has
been aligned in certain aspects to the Group’s accounting policies. The Optima Telekom Acquisition was approved
by the Croatian Competition Agency on December 21, 2021 and is expected to complete in January 2022.

(c) Represents estimated last two quarters Adjusted EBITDAaL expected to be generated by Tessa Energy, based on
management’s assumptions regarding, among others, its investment in the Kremena Wind Park, the expected power
generation of the Kremena Wind Park, expected energy price levels as well as expected operating expenses related
to such investment, in each case, as if the acquisition of Tessa Energy and its investment in the Kremena Wind Park
was completed on April 1, 2021. Although the acquisition of Tessa Energy was completed on November 30, 2021,
its investment in the Kremena Wind Park is expected in 2022, and there can be no assurance that such investment
will be completed by such expected date or at all. As a result, this information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of Tessa Energy and
the Kremena Wind Park for the period presented. There can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated
results in a timely manner or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may not

EBITDAaL of the following companies for the period from April 1, 2021 to the date on which the results of such
companies were consolidated with the Group’s results, each of which were acquired during the period: N3, ComNet,
D Express and Mainstream, and derived from their respective unaudited management accounts, which might not be
fully aligned to the Group’s accounting policies; and (iii) the estimated effect on last two quarters Adjusted
EBITDAaL derived from certain synergies expected to be generated following the acquisition of Vestnik Telegraf,
based on management’s estimates regarding the impact of certain actions and initiatives implemented in connection
with this acquisition, as if these actions were implemented on April 1, 2021. As a result, this information is inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results
of these actions and initiatives for the period presented. There can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated
synergies in a timely manner or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may

(e) Represents estimated last two quarters Adjusted EBITDAaL generated by Wind Hellas’ fiber network business that
was transferred to FiberCo on January 3, 2022, based on management’s estimates. FiberCo is an Unrestricted
Subsidiary under the Bridge Facilities and therefore is not subject to the covenants included therein. On the Wind
Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, FiberCo is expected to be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the
existing Indentures and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and therefore not to be subject to the covenants
therein. In addition, FiberCo will be an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the SSN Indenture and therefore will not be
subject to the covenants included therein. For more details on the separation of Wind Hellas’ fiber business, please
refer to “Wind Hellas’ Business—Network and facilities—Fiber Asset Separation.”

(f) Represents the estimated effect on last two quarters Adjusted EBITDAaL derived from (i) certain cost savings
(primarily in respect of staff costs) expected to be generated from the integration of Wind Hellas and Nova, and (ii)
revenue expected to be generated from existing Wind Hellas’ contracts with the Greek government relating to the
connectivity procurement program SYZEFXIS II, in each case based on management’s assumptions regarding the
impact of actions and initiatives implemented in connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition, as if the Wind Hellas
Acquisition was completed, and such actions and initiatives were fully implemented, on April 1, 2021. As a result,
this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of
the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives for the period presented. There can be no assurance
that we will realize anticipated additional revenue, synergies and cost savings in a timely manner or at all. See “Risk

_Forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Adjusted EBITDAaL included in this offering memorandum” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Wind Hellas Acquisition—We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational_
_efficiencies and cost savings from the Wind Hellas Acquisition.”_

###### RISK FACTORS

_You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in_
_this offering memorandum before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks may have_
_a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and_
_as a result you may lose all or part of your original investment. The risks described below are not the_
_only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently_
_deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,_
_financial condition and cash flows._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_The cable television, broadband internet, DTH and telephony markets in the regions in which we_**
**_operate are highly competitive._**

We face significant competition in each of our product and service segments and may face competition
from new entrants in the future. The nature and level of the competition we face varies for each of the
products and services we offer and by region, but we generally compete on the basis of quality of
content, network quality, marketing, product and service portfolio specifications, customer care, sales
and marketing services as well as price. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, television
providers, including providers using alternative and emerging digital technologies such as Internet
Protocol Television (“IPTV”) and OTT content owners; DTH-TV providers; broadband internet and
telephony services providers; public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) or fiber connections; and
in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Greece (following completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition), other
MNOs or MVNOs, including those using LTE technology. In addition, continued consolidation within
the media industry may allow more competitors to offer bundles of digital television, fixed-line
telephony, mobile-telephony and broadband services, and consolidation by competitors could allow
them to benefit from economies of scale that we do not have. As a result, we may compete against
companies with easier access to financing, more comprehensive product offerings, greater personnel
resources, greater brand name recognition and experience or longer established relationships with
regulatory authorities and customers, resulting in fewer regulatory burdens with which they are required
to comply.

Communications technologies and consumer electronics, as well as the way information,
communication and entertainment is offered, are constantly changing, and the impact of such changes
can be difficult to predict. Current and future competitors may expand their product and service offering
more rapidly or adapt to new or emerging technologies more quickly than us (for example Telekom
Srbija in Serbia and M:TEL in Montenegro have quickly upgraded their Gigabit Passive Optical
Network (“GPON”) platforms), or may offer their products and services at a lower price than ours, for
example, where our services are priced at the high end of the market, which could cause us to lose
subscribers, force us to lower our prices or otherwise adversely affect the margin of profit we are able
to achieve from our services. In particular, we face the following risks in relation to each of our product
offerings:

_Television_

While competition among cable Pay-TV providers in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently
low due to minimal cable overbuild, we face competition in the Serbian television market from other
methods of television services distribution, such as DTH and IPTV. Our main competitor in Serbia is
the state-owned incumbent Telekom Srbija. During 2018 and 2019, Telekom Srbija purchased several
independent cable operators, offering Pay-TV, telephony and internet services, as well as the DTH users
of Polaris Media, a Serbian DTH platform, strengthening Telekom Srbija’s presence in the Serbian
market. Our main Pay-TV competitor in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the incumbent in the ethnic region
in which we operate, BH Telecom. Competition in the Pay-TV market in Slovenia is strong, particularly
for the provision of Fiber to the Home (“FttH”) services between Telekom Slovenije and T2, especially


-----

in metropolitan areas. Our main competitors in the Slovenian Pay-TV market are Telekom Slovenije,
T2 and A1. Competition in Montenegro is strong, and the primary competitors are Crnogorski Telekom
(IPTV and FTTx) and M:TEL (FTTx and HFC). Both operators have a very large market share and a
large number of users. We also compete with A1 Bulgaria and Bulsatcom for offering Pay-TV services
in Bulgaria. Both of these competitors have larger market shares by number of subscribers than
Vivacom, which may make it difficult for us to build our Pay-TV subscriber base. In Greece we compete
with OTE (Cosmote) and Vodafone Greece.

Additionally, we face increased competition from non-traditional television services based on new
internet technologies, including OTT television services, which have increased in number and quality
over the past few years. OTT television services deliver Pay-TV content “on top” of an existing
broadband internet connection directly to a television, PC, laptop, tablet or mobile devices. OTT service
providers leverage existing infrastructures and are often not required to implement capital intensive
models associated with traditional data providers like us. We cannot rule out that increased availability
of OTT content as well as advances in broadband and mobile internet connection speeds will lead to
increased competition from OTT providers in the future.

_Fixed Broadband Internet_

Although we continue to hold stable market shares in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, we face
strong competition in these markets from other broadband internet services, such as ADSL and VDSL
broadband connections and FttH providers. Our main competitors for broadband internet services are
Telekom Srbija in Serbia and BH Telecom and Telecom RS in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Bulgaria,
we compete with A1 Bulgaria and Bulsatcom and in Greece we compete with OTE (Cosmote) and
Vodafone Greece. Continued upgrades from DSL based broadband internet service to FttH, such as the
optical network that has been constructed in Serbia by Telekom Srbija, and more widespread FttH
installations could have a negative impact on our competitive position in the broadband internet market.

Due to extensive overbuild and high levels of broadband internet penetration in Slovenia, we face
significant competition in the broadband internet market segment from fiber broadband internet
providers such as Telekom Slovenije, T2 and A1. In particular, we compete against Telekom Slovenije’s
optical network services. Moreover, mobile operators are increasingly able to utilize a combination of
powerful handsets and high bandwidth technologies such as 5G and LTE technologies. Additional
competition may come from satellite technologies and operators that use microwave access (“WiMax”)
technologies. In the Montenegrin broadband internet market, Crnogorski Telekom utilizes FTTx, ADSL
and VDSL broadband, and M:TEL currently utilizes HFC, which will soon replace FTTx on its network.

_Fixed-Line Telephony_

In the liberalized Serbian and Bosnian telephony markets, we compete with the respective state-owned
former monopolies, Telekom Srbija in Serbia and BH Telecom and Telecom RS in Bosnia, which
dominate the fixed-line PSTN telephone market. We believe that the Slovenian telephony market is
relatively mature and market share changes are mainly driven by the combination of the price and
quality of the services provided by bundled offerings. Our main competitors in Slovenia are Telekom
Slovenije, T2, and A1, and our main competitors in Montenegro are the incumbent operator, Crnogorski
Telekom, and M: Tel. In addition, in Bulgaria, we compete in the fixed-line telephony market
predominantly with A1 Bulgaria, which, in addition to Vivacom, is the only other fully converged
telecommunications operator in Bulgaria. Following completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition, we
will compete in the Greek fixed-line telephony market predominantly with OTE (Cosmote), the
incumbent fixed-line operator in Greece, and Vodafone Greece.

Further, we operate in an industry that is affected by fixed-line to mobile-telephony substitution, and as
a result there may be decreased demand for our fixed-line telephony services. We may be affected in
each of the markets in which we operate by providers of free Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”)
services such as Apple’s FaceTime service or WhatsApp which have considerably improved their


-----

speech quality over the last few years and can be accessed from any device connected to the internet,
including smartphones.

_Mobile-Telephony_

We provide mobile-telephony services in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Greece (following completion
of the Wind Hellas Acquisition), respectively, as an MNO. Accordingly, we face strong competition
for subscribers from established competitors, including, in particular, Telekom Slovenije and A1
Telekom Austria in Slovenia, A1 Bulgaria and Telenor in Bulgaria, Croatian Telecom, A1 Croatia and
T Mobile Croatia in Croatia and OTE (Cosmote) and Vodafone Greece in Greece (following completion
of the Wind Hellas Acquisition), as well as other mobile telecommunications that may enter the
Slovenian, Bulgarian or Croatian mobile markets (such as Hofer Telekom, which recently entered the
Slovenian mobile market). Certain competitors have undertaken or announced intentions to undertake
acquisitions in the mobile telecommunications markets in which we operate. PPF Group, a private
investment group in Europe, completed its acquisition of the telecommunications assets of Telenor
Group in Serbia, Montenegro, Hungary and Bulgaria in July 2018. Any other planned acquisitions by
competitors, if consummated, could negatively impact our business, such as by reducing our market
share or forcing us to undertake more capital expenditure or to lower prices.

To the extent we were to lose market share to any competitors, our revenues may decline. If we fail to
increase our market share in line with our expectations, we will be less profitable, which will adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In Bulgaria, the mobile market has
stabilized as the three main market participants are of roughly equal size and have all shifted to a value
for money strategy, which may hinder our ability to differentiate ourselves and our ability to grow our
market share. Additionally, in each of the markets in which we compete, our competitors may improve
their ability to attract new subscribers, or provide their offerings or services at lower prices to increase
their respective market shares, which would make it more difficult for us to retain our current
subscribers or expand our subscriber base without us lowering our prices or increasing our subscriber
retention cost. In order to compete, we may have to lower prices, which may reduce our margins and/or
increase our marketing and promotional expenses, each of which may cause our operating profit to
decline significantly.

_Bundled Offerings_

Customers of video and telecommunications services are increasingly expecting service providers to
offer high-quality bundles of television, broadband internet and telephony services. Many of our
competitors, including Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia, Telecom RS, HT
Eronet and BH Telecom in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Crnogorski Telekom and M:TEL in
Montenegro, offer bundled packages of services. Several of these bundles include mobile phone
services, which we offer in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and following the completion of the Wind Hellas
Acquisition, in Greece. If our bundled products are not able to compete effectively in the markets in
which we operate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected.

_E-Commerce_

In July 2020, we launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which is
currently available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and Slovenia.
Shoppster’s key competitors include, among others, e-commerce platforms such as E Kupi in Serbia
and Mimovrste, EnaA, Big Bang, Merkur and Piazz in Slovenia, as well as traditional retail stores such
as Gigatron and Tehnomanija in Serbia.

Increased competition, or any inability to provide cable and DTH Pay-TV, broadband internet and
telephony services at competitive prices, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.


-----

**_Difficult economic conditions may reduce subscriber spending for our pay television, broadband_**
**_internet, and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services and reduce our rate of growth of subscriber_**
**_additions._**

Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by weakening global or domestic
economic conditions, wavering consumer confidence and unemployment, including as a result of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing measures and other restrictions imposed in
response by the governments of each of the countries in which we operate. See “—Any outbreak of
_severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of_
_operations.” In addition, our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by the_
impact of state implemented austerity measures. As customers may view spending for most of our
services, such as Pay-TV, as discretionary, the risks associated with certain segments of our business
become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession as consumers may delay purchasing
decisions or reduce or reallocate their discretionary funds. Current customers may elect to downgrade
their packages or move to less costly providers, and new customers may opt to take out our lower end
broadband and Pay-TV packages rather than more expensive ones or may opt to become customers of
less costly competitors, or not to subscribe to Pay-TV services at all.

We are also exposed to risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers, many
of whom may be adversely affected by a general economic downturn. This may lead to a higher number
of non-paying subscribers. Suppliers and distributors may also be more cautious in supplying goods to
us and may request additional credit enhancements or more restrictive payment terms. While the impact
of an economic slowdown on our business is difficult to predict, it could have a material adverse effect
on our revenues and our cash flow.

**_Our operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot generate strong advertising sales._**

We generate revenue from the sale of advertising on or in our television stations and broadcast and
cable networks. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions,
as well as budgeting and buying patterns. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the
economy in general, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the relevant
responses taken by the governments of the countries in which we operate, could alter current or
prospective advertisers’ spending priorities as well as advertising pricing. See _“—Any outbreak of_
_severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of_
_operations.” Demand for our products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. For example,_
ratings points for our television stations and broadcast and cable networks are factors that are weighed
when determining advertising rates, and with respect to our television stations and broadcast and
television networks, when determining the affiliate rates received by us. In addition, newer
technologies, including new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet,
video on demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies are increasing the
number of media and entertainment choices available to audiences. Some of these devices and
technologies allow users to view television or films from a remote location or on a time delayed basis
and provide users the ability to fast forward, rewind, pause and skip programming and advertisements.
These technological developments could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to viewers, advertisers
and/or distributors. Failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in
consumer behavior could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, a decrease in advertising
expenditures, reduced demand for our offerings or the inability to obtain market ratings that adequately
measure demand for our content on personal video recorders and mobile devices could lead to a
reduction in pricing and advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and cash flows.

**_We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into asset dispositions or other transactions that_**
**_may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were_**
**_contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the_**
**_integration of any acquisitions._**


-----

As part of our business strategy, we pursue strategic and opportunistic acquisitions of service providers,
content providers and cable assets, and we may undertake other transactions to optimize our portfolio
of assets, such as asset sales or investments in third parties. Any of these transactions could be material
to our financial condition or results of operations. Despite our successful track record, we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to continue undertaking acquisitions and other transactions and our ability
to acquire new businesses and optimize our portfolio of assets may be limited by many factors, including
availability of financing, debt covenants, complex ownership structures among potential targets and
government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers. In addition, our debt burden may
increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisition, which could have a negative impact on
our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations and make cash interest payments on the
Senior Secured Notes.

Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of such businesses may prove to
be more difficult than we initially anticipated and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and
expenditures. Acquisitions pose certain risks, for example, difficulties or delays in consolidating
operations and achieving anticipated synergies, cost savings, revenues and cash flow enhancements,
growth, operational efficiencies and other benefits; diversion of managerial resources away from our
day-to-day business operations; potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to the extent that we
issue new shares to fund an acquisition; and the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed
risks.

Furthermore, certain contracts of the businesses acquired by us contain “change of control” provisions
that require the acquired company to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control, or contain
language that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to certain conditions, the counterparty to
terminate the contract following a change of control. For example, Nova BG and Optima Telekom are
party to certain agreements with international television content providers which contain change of
control clauses. The Optima Telekom Acquisition may also constitute a change of control under certain
agreements. Although the agreements governing certain of our acquisitions require the target to use
commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain consents or waivers relating to such “change of control”
provisions prior to closing of the acquisitions, such consents and waivers are generally not a condition
to closing. If a substantial number of these contracts have been, are or will be terminated as a result of
our acquisition, we may be forced to enter into new contracts on less favorable terms, or we may be
unable to secure replacements.

While we strive to mitigate unexpected liabilities and risks though contractual protections in our
acquisition documentation, we cannot ensure that such protections will be effective. For example,
although the share sale and purchase agreements pursuant to which we acquire businesses typically
contain warranties related to, among other things, compliance with laws, licenses and consents and
financial crime, and provides, subject to certain qualifications and limitations, for indemnification from
the seller in the event of breach of warranties, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in any
claims that we may bring for breach of warranties based on the relevant agreement or that any recovery
made under this agreement would cover the potential losses arising out of any such breach. If we enter
into an acquisition agreement, but the acquisition is not consummated, we may be liable for break-up
fees or other payments, which may, in some cases, be material.

Acquisitions we undertake typically contain certain indemnities and customary representations and
warranties in the relevant acquisition agreements. However, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to enforce any claims relating to breaches of such representations and warranties, and sellers’
liability, with respect to breaches of their representations and warranties, is limited.

From time to time, we may also dispose of certain assets in an effort to optimize our portfolio of assets
and maximize value for our stakeholders. Such disposals may include all or part of certain of our
business lines, mobile and broadband infrastructure or other assets. Any such transaction could change
our business profile or prospects or leave us more reliant on third parties for key aspects of our networks.


-----

**_Any acquisition we undertake or have undertaken may be subject to regulatory approval or review_**
**_by competition authorities which could delay, limit or prevent its completion or could prevent us from_**
**_realizing the benefits from any such acquisition following its completion._**

Acquisitions we undertake may require the approval of governmental authorities (at both national and
European levels), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a
failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all. Past acquisitions
by the Group, including recent acquisitions, are or may become subject to review by competition
authorities within the relevant jurisdictions. Such competition authorities may take the position that
merger control filings were required, and should we fail to meet such requests or requirements in a
timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a
merger transaction, may require corrective measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or
divestiture of operations.

For example, in the past, relevant competition authorities in Serbia and Slovenia have challenged a
number of our acquisitions, in some cases resulting in a requirement of divestiture or the levying of
fines, which can be substantial. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.”

We also may be subject to challenges brought by certain of our competitors. For example, in 2021,
Vivacom acquired local broadband and television operators Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia EAD, Digital
Cable Television EOOD and agreed to acquire Networx-Bulgaria EOOD. These transactions were
approved by the Bulgarian Commission on Protection of Competition (“CPC”), which provided the
required merger clearing authorizations. However, Telenor Bulgaria EAD challenged the CPC’s
decisions for approval relating to these transactions before the respective administrative court. Vivacom
has intervened in support of the CPC’s decisions. We believe that the CPC’s decisions were wellreasoned and consistent with Bulgarian competition law. Nevertheless, in September and October 2021,
the administrative court issued judgments by which it annulled CPC’s approvals regarding the
acquisition of Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia EAD and Digital Cable Television EOOD, essentially for
reasons relating to the formal procedure before the CPC. The CPC and Vivacom filed appeals against
these judgments in front of the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court. These judgments did not have
any impact on the acquisitions as the appeals suspended the application of the judgments, and Vivacom
has already integrated the acquired companies. If the first instance judgments and annulments are upheld
by the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court, the CPC will have to re-examine the transactions.
Telenor Bulgaria’s challenge against the CPC’s approval relating to the acquisition of NetworxBulgaria EOOD is currently pending in front of the administrative court.

Any risks associated with acquisitions or future acquisitions could have a significant negative impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Acceptance of our content, particularly our television programming, by the public is difficult to_**
**_predict, which could lead to fluctuations in revenues._**

Television production and distribution are uncertain businesses since the revenues derived from the
production and distribution of a television series depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public,
which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a television program also depends upon the
quality and acceptance of other competing television programming released into the marketplace at or
near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment and
leisure time activities, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending and other
tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty.
Audience ratings for a television program are generally a key factor in generating revenues from other
distribution channels, such as content licensing. Given the production costs that are incurred prior to
airing a new television program, the profitability of television production and the recovery of upfront
costs depend on the program’s popularity upon and following the initial airing. A decline in the ratings
or popularity of our entertainment, sports or news television programming, which could be a result of
the loss of talent or rights to certain programming, could adversely affect advertising revenues in the


-----

near term and, over a longer period of time, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We do not have guaranteed access to all of our television content and are dependent on our_**
**_agreements, relationships and cooperation with content owners, including broadcasters and_**
**_collective rights associations._**

The success of our business depends on, among other things, the quality and variety of the television
content delivered to our customers. We depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with
third parties for the majority of our content. We receive content for our cable and DTH Pay-TV services
pursuant to licenses with content owners, including high-quality regional and international television
networks such as FOX, ViaSat and Universal channels. Additionally, we produce our own content
through our in-house content company.

While we intend to negotiate additional access to continue to expand our Pay-TV product range, rights
to premium or high definition (“HD”) content may in the future be obtained by our competitors on an
exclusive basis and therefore not be available to us. Additionally, we may be unable to secure content
on an exclusive basis and may have to share broadcasting rights with our competitors, which could lead
to a dilution of our brand name. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to secure content which is
more popular than ours, and changes in our subscribers’ content preferences could result in a decrease
of the popularity of our content and an increase in the popularity of that of our competitors. While we
have successfully developed our video on demand and other interactive services as well as our own
television content in the past, our ability to source content will be increasingly important and will
depend on our ability to maintain relationships and cooperation with content owners and broadcasters
for both standard and HD content as well as our ability to accurately predict our customers’ content
preferences. Furthermore, our NetTV Plus OTT content platform, which distributes local ethnic content
to former Yugoslav expats around the world, relies on the availability of a number of local free-to-air
channels and no fee contracts for the distribution of such content. In the past, we have faced difficulties
obtaining such local content free of charge or negotiating contracts with local TV channel providers on
satisfactory terms, and in the past this led to the removal of some of these channels. Additionally, from
time to time, we face disputes over the rights to certain of the OTT content that we show. If we fail to
produce, obtain or retain on satisfactory terms sufficient popular and quality programming for our
digital cable and DTH services, or local content for our OTT content platform; if the content we provide
is only popular for a short period of time; if our competitors secure content that is more popular than
ours; or if the popularity of our content declines, our ability to attract customers from competitors to
our services, retain current customers, compete effectively with free TV channel providers or recoup
our content production costs may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, as we depend upon such content owners for the provision of content to attract and retain
customers, content owners may have considerable power to renegotiate the license fees we pay them.
Most license agreements are renewed on a regular basis, typically every three years. We may be unable
to renew such contracts on terms that are similar to those of the current agreements, which could result
in an increase in our content costs or, if we are unable to agree on the terms of service, the cancellation
of such license contracts. For example, in 2021, we have lost our broadcasting rights for the English
Premier League and other premium sport content in some of our countries of operations following
unsuccessful bids to renew the relevant licenses with the content owners. The loss of certain content
could, in turn, affect our customer base. Difficulties encountered with content suppliers may result in
disruptions in our operations, loss of profitability and damage to our reputation, financial condition or
results of operations.

**_Any failure to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards could harm our_**
**_competitive position and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business._**


-----

The broadband internet, television and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services sectors are
characterized by rapid and significant changes in technology. We will need to anticipate and react to
these changes and develop successful new and enhanced products and services quickly enough to adapt
to the changing market. This could result in the need to make substantial investments in new or
enhanced technologies, products or services, and we may not be able to adopt such technology due to
insufficient capital or for other reasons, such as incompatibilities with our systems. In addition, new
technologies, such as 5G or 3D TV, will or may become dominant in the future, rendering our current
technologies and systems obsolete.

In particular, we expect certain communications technologies that are currently under development or
have recently been introduced, namely 5G in the future and 4G LTE currently, which allow for faster
data transmission and lower unit cost per gigabyte transferred traffic compared to 3G, to become
increasingly important in our market. We currently hold a 4G license in Slovenia and in April 2021
acquired licenses for 5G spectrum frequencies in Slovenia. We also hold a 4G license in Bulgaria and
in May 2021, we secured a license for 5G spectrum frequencies in Bulgaria after announcing the
commercial launch of its 5G network in September 2020. In addition, we hold a 4G license in Croatia
and in July 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Croatia for 5G frequencies, and commenced
deployment and commercial launch of our 5G C-Band in September 2021. Following completion of the
Wind Hellas Acquisition, we will hold a 4G license in Greece. In December 2020, Wind Hellas acquired
a 15-year spectrum license in Greece for 5G frequencies and started its 5G deployment in the same
year. However, if we are unable to effectively compete in the 4G market or keep pace with technological
developments (particularly the development of our 5G network at a pace comparable to that of our
competitors and acquire new frequencies) and invest significantly in 5G technologies, we could lose
subscribers or fail to attract new subscribers, which would impact subscriber churn, or incur substantial
costs and investments in order to maintain our subscriber base, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The availability of any new features developed for use in our industry can have a significant impact on
a subscriber’s initial decision to choose our or a competitor’s products. We may not be able to develop
or partner with third-party suppliers to gain access to technical advances before our competitors, match
technological innovations by our competitors or design systems that meet subscribers’ requirements.
Our ability to effectively anticipate and adapt successfully to changes in technology in our industry and
provide new or enhanced services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or successfully anticipate the
demands of our subscribers, will determine whether we will be able to increase or maintain our
subscriber and revenue base. As a result, new or enhanced technologies, services or offerings we
introduce may fail to achieve sufficient market acceptance or experience technical difficulties. For
example, we do not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to
support all of the enhancements we may introduce to our broadband internet and television services
over time. If we fail to respond adequately to technological changes, we could lose subscribers and
experience a decrease in revenues and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of
operations would be materially and adversely affected.

Additionally, the cost of implementing emerging and new technologies could be significant and we may
fail to obtain the necessary financing. If we are unable to obtain such financing at attractive terms or at
all, we might not be able to make the necessary technological changes or upgrades and our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

**_We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, as a result of which we may be_**
**_affected by unforeseen changes in regulation and government policy which may increase our costs_**
**_and otherwise adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to significant governmental regulation and supervision. See “Our Business—Regulatory
_Framework.”_


-----

Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy affecting our activities and those of our
competitors could significantly influence how we operate our business, our ability to offer certain
products and services and our ability to introduce new products and services. In particular, regulatory
changes relating to our activities and those of our competitors, such as changes relating to third-party
access to cable networks, the costs of interconnection with other networks or the prices of competing
products and services, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators,
could adversely affect our ability to set prices, enter new markets or control our costs. In Serbia, we are
the subject of various pending regulatory actions, including from the Serbian Tax Authority and
RATEL. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.”

In addition, any change in existing laws, regulations or governmental policies and/or the
implementation of any new law, regulation, including sanction regimes, or governmental policy, both
at a national or international level, on certain communication technologies that are currently under
development or have recently been introduced, namely 5G, in the countries in which we operate, may
result in increased costs and logistical complexity for us. For example, the U.S., the UK, Belgium,
Denmark, Estonia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania and Sweden have either banned,
restricted or imposed certain conditions on technology from Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications
company, and certain of its affiliates, from being used in the development of their 5G networks, which
in the UK has delayed the development of its 5G network as a result of the government compelling UK
telecommunications companies to seek alternative suppliers. We have entered into a global frame
agreement with Huawei in respect of mobile radio network equipment. For more information, see “Our
_Business—Network—Mobile—Mobile Network Evolution—Mobile Radio Network Equipment_
_Agreement.” If a similar ban is imposed in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia or Greece, or if otherwise_
obtaining or using Huawei technology is restricted by the governments of the countries in which we
operate, this may result in us having to find alternative suppliers for 5G network equipment, which may
increase costs for us to develop and maintain our networks and which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot predict how
existing or future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products or services. In addition,
our business and the industry in which we operate are subject to investigation by regulators, which
could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and
damages. Any such action could harm our reputation and result in increased costs to the business.

**_We are exposed to currency exchange fluctuation and currency instability risks in Europe that could_**
**_have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows._**

The reporting currency of our business is the euro. While Slovenia, Montenegro and Greece use the
euro as the official currency, and while the value of the Bosnian mark and Bulgarian lev are pegged to
the euro, we collect subscriber fees in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and North Macedonia,
where local currencies are not pegged to the euro. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 28%,
47% and 42% of our revenues in Serbian dinar and Croatian kuna. At the same time, the vast majority
of our costs to operate our business as well as our capital expenditure are paid in euros. The Serbian
dinar has fluctuated in the past (including through inflation), and may fluctuate in the future, resulting
in significant and unpredictable foreign exchange losses and gains. Additionally, although the Croatian
Kuna has been relatively stable in the past, any fluctuations could affect our results of operations, as
with the fluctuations of the Serbian Dinar in the past. If the euro appreciated in value against the Serbian
dinar, the Bulgarian lev, the Croatian kuna (which will be replaced by the euro on January 1, 2023) or
other local currencies, and we are unable to pass through increased costs to our customers or if we are
unable to exchange the various local currencies into euros at all, our revenue would decrease which
would make it more difficult to generate the cash necessary to continue our operations without
disruptions, cover our costs and meet our capital expenditure requirements.


-----

Additionally, economic events in recent years affecting European economies have raised a number of
questions regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union. Credit risk in
these countries and in other Eurozone countries, especially in Slovenia, could have a negative impact
on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability and suitability of the euro as a
single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual states which use
the euro. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the
abandonment of the euro as a currency, or the reintroduction of an individual currency in Slovenia and
Greece, as well as the de pegging of the Bosnian mark or the Bulgarian lev from the euro, could have
major negative effects on our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely
affect the economy in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Greece, respectively. In
particular, the departure of Slovenia from the euro would increase our exposure to changes in currency
rates. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and have a
significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our_**
**_business and results of operations._**

Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or
other illnesses, may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and
financial markets of many countries, leading to substantial declines in consumer purchasing power and
resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services, our ability
to collect against existing trade receivables and our operating results. In particular, in response to the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 and 2021, governments of the countries in which we
conduct our operations implemented several measures, including travel restrictions, lockdowns,
quarantines and other social distancing measures, which have had a material adverse impact on the
overall economies of such countries and, as a result, could have a material adverse impact on our results
of operations, in particular, our revenues generated from advertising, media selling, mobile handsets
sales and our mobile international roaming revenues as well as on our ARPUs. For example, from
March 2020 until May 2020, in October 2020 and again in December 2021, the Netherlands adopted
several social distancing and other restrictive measures, particularly with respect to access to
restaurants, shopping centers and other commercial facilities, aimed at mitigating the negative
consequences of the pandemic. In compliance with these restrictive measures, during the governmentimposed lockdowns we closed substantially all of our facilities in all of our countries of operation, while
maintaining a limited number of employees in business critical functions on-site to operate our data
centers and transitioned all of our remaining employees to remote working. As the governments of the
countries in which we operate attempt to implement economic recovery measures while managing a
resurgence in new infections, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place or
may be re imposed, which continue to adversely affect the economies of the countries in which we
operate and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work
effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter in place arrangements, government actions,
facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be
materially impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and carry out new sales
activity, and some of our costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.

As a result of social distancing measures and restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, our customers may not be able to operate their businesses for a prolonged and indeterminate
period of time, which, if realized, will likely impact our operations. Moreover, it is possible that the
continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection, or a renewed or extended lockdown in one
or more of the countries in which we operate, if realized, will cause further disruption in our business
operations, cause delay, or limit the ability of, our customers to perform under their existing contracts,
including making timely payments to us, and cause other unpredictable events. Customers may
experience significant losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak and may terminate their existing contracts
or postpone or ultimately cancel future planned orders and contracts due to those losses. Both domestic
and international travel may be further restricted to certain areas which may limit our ability to obtain


-----

new customers and enter new markets, to provide services in the areas in which our customers are
currently located or otherwise conduct our operations as we have done in the past.

To the extent our activities are disrupted by restrictions imposed by governments or other authorities to
address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, or by changes in customer behavior, this may result in
a loss of customers, and our future rate of growth may slow compared to our past growth rates. The
general economic impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the communities that we serve may result in
customers not being able to continue to pay for our services or deciding to postpone, cancel or reduce
their existing subscriptions. This could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as a
reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could negatively impact our liquidity, cash flow,
profitability and attrition rate. In addition, social distancing measures resulting in the cancellation or
postponement of certain sporting events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the
results of our Media Group segment. In particular, as a result of such measures revenues generated from
our Media Group segment, excluding the impact of revenues generated by Nova BG, decreased by 9%
in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The disruptions triggered by
COVID-19 in countries where our suppliers and customers are located, may result in a slowdown of
their production activities and other disruptions, any of which could have a material impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in some of the jurisdictions in which
we operate we have received certain state supported aid which we may be obliged to return if certain
conditions are met, potentially together with interest in arrears from the day of the receipt of the relevant
aid.

Any political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 outbreak by European Union institutions as
well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard to predict consequences
for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow down or
reversal of European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions,
the governments of the countries in which we operate to contain the COVID-19 outbreak are adequate
and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is also unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 outbreak
will be contained. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other
contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects our business, results of operations and
financial condition depends on several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19
pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in the countries in which our customers are located, and
the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating conditions will stabilize and
recover in the countries where we operate. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental
authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic
adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects, as well as our
ability to perform our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, it may also have the effect of
heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

**_Legal, political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, including the exit of the United Kingdom_**

**_currency fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

The United Kingdom (“UK”) held a referendum on June 23, 2016, to determine whether the UK should
leave the EU or remain as a Member State, and the outcome of that referendum was in favor of leaving
the EU. While the EU and the UK agreed a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement
on December 24, 2020, which was ratified by the UK parliament on December 30, 2020 and came into
force on January 1, 2021, the end of the transition period has led to increased customs, health and safety
checks at the border, which could delay or disrupt the movement of goods between the EU and the UK,
undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the
EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU. Additionally, the UK has


-----

ceased to be a member of the EU single market, which has ended the free movement of services and
workers between the UK and the EU and may make it more difficult for our UK operations to do
business with customers or suppliers that are based in the EU. The impact of the UK-EU trade
agreement and the resulting effects on the political and economic future of the UK remain uncertain.
Economic instability and uncertainty in Europe, has and may continue to adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

Due to the size and importance of the UK economy, the uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the
UK’s legal, political and economic relationship with Europe may continue to be a source of instability
in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect
trading agreements or similar cross border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal,
legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. It is also possible that the exit of the UK from
the EU will lead other EU Member States to consider leaving the EU, which could be an additional
source of instability in the international markets. Further, other EU Member States within the Eurozone
could decide to discontinue their use of the euro as their functional currency. The exit of the UK (or the
possible exit of any other country) from the EU, the potential withdrawal of Scotland from the UK, or
prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities, could result in significant
macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, further decreases in global stock exchange
indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a further weakening of the pound sterling
and euro against other leading currencies), and decreased GDP in the EU or other markets in which we
operate. In addition, there are increasing concerns that these events could push the UK or Eurozone into
an economic recession and/or worsen the economic recession caused by the global COVID-19
pandemic, any of which, were they to occur, would further destabilize the global financial markets.

Our operations are also subject to risks from high levels of sovereign debt in certain European countries,
which combined with weak economic growth and high unemployment, could lead to fiscal reforms
(including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, higher levels of volatility and potential
disruptions in the credit and equity markets, in particular as a result of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to
individual macro fundamentals on a country by country basis, as well as with respect to the overall
stability of the European Monetary Union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal
with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. The
realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary
Union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries or, in more extreme
circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European Monetary Union entirely. The capital market
disruption that would likely accompany any such event could have a material adverse impact on our
liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied
by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could
have an adverse impact on demand for our products, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows.
As we generate revenue in a number of different currencies, including the euro, Serbian dinar, Bosnian
mark, Bulgarian lev and Croatian kuna, increased currency fluctuation could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations. See _“—We are exposed to currency exchange fluctuation and_
_currency instability risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial_
_condition and cash flows.”_

For these reasons, legal, political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our operations in some markets are constrained by political factors and our business might be_**
**_affected by factors or changes in the political, judicial, economic or security environment in the_**
**_countries in which we operate._**

We operate in countries across Southeastern Europe and the governments of these countries differ with
respect to structure, stability and level of regulation. As some of our operations, such as network
expansions and construction or acquisition of cable assets, depend on governmental approval and


-----

regulatory decisions, we may make decisions influenced by political considerations rather than fully
exploiting our contractual or legal rights, in order to avoid negatively affecting our relationship with
national, regional or local authorities, including regulators. Additionally, the respective governments in
our core markets currently own a majority stake in our biggest competitors in those markets: Telekom
Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia and BH Telecom and HT Eronet in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. As a result of this, our competitors may have special privileges with regulatory authorities
or receive other forms of governmental support. Accordingly, our operations may be constrained by the
relevant political environment and may be adversely affected by such constraints.

The majority of the countries in which we operate has a short legislative, judicial and administrative
history and it is not possible to predict with certainty the effect of current and future legislation on our
business. Company, commercial, contract, customs, currency, property, banking, bankruptcy,
competition, securities, labor, tax and other laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate
(including those concerning privatization and the compensation of former owners) are still developing
and continue to be substantially revised. There is little precedent for how these laws and regulations
will be interpreted or implemented either by the courts or government agencies. Existing and future
laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. For example, in Bulgaria, the regulatory practices
of the CPC and the Bulgarian Communications Regulation Commission is not always concerted which
can cause conflicting decisions in the regulation of electronic communications. These factors could
result in market uncertainty, lack of clear criteria and in many cases could lead to excessive regulation.
In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may experience difficulties or delays in obtaining permits
or other governmental authorizations.

Additionally, in certain countries in which we operate, political, security and economic changes may
result in political and regulatory uncertainty and civil unrest. In Bulgaria, for example, protests against
alleged government corruption began in July 2020, resulting in large demonstrations in Sofia, Varna,
Plovdiv and other areas of the country. Protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko
Borissov and the state chief prosecutor. Such unrest continued in 2021 when the citizens of Bulgaria
voted in three snap parliamentary elections that took place in April, July and November, respectively,
following which some of the country’s largest parties eventually managed to produce a working
coalition government in December 2021. However, the uncertainty around the stability of the new
Bulgarian government could have a material adverse effect on our development in the country,
including our plans for building our mobile network and growing our customer base. Furthermore, the
majority of countries in which we operate are emerging economies and as such are more susceptible to
adverse global economic trends and higher inflationary pressure, which could have a negative effect on
the growth of our business or operations, increase our operating costs or decrease consumer demand
and spending power.

Additionally, the judicial systems of certain of the countries in which we operate may not be fully
independent of social, economic and political forces, and many courts in these countries experience a
high volume of case backlogs. This often results in inconsistent judicial interpretation of laws and
regulations and excessive delays in court proceedings. Relatedly, certain market participants in the
countries in which we operate may conduct their operations without regard for applicable laws or
regulations, which creates competitive disadvantages for other participants. In Bulgaria, for example, it
is not uncommon for certain TV operators to use content illegally without contracts with the content
owners or to underreport the number of their subscribers or for certain broadband operators to provide
internet access with cable networks constructed in non-compliance with Bulgarian regulations. As a
result of the foregoing, we may operate with competitive disadvantages or may not be able to enforce
our legal rights efficiently or successfully, including title to our intellectual property, under the laws of
the countries in which we operate. Each of these factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial conditions or result of operations.

**_We do not hold valid use permits for parts of our cable network and we are dependent on leases for_**
**_certain parts of our network in various countries in which we operate._**


-----

_Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro_

We currently do not hold use permits for a portion of our network in Serbia. Given that a cadaster of
lines has just recently begun to function and we are still taking steps to proceed with our registration of
the network in the cadaster, the legal status of our cable infrastructure can only be established by
reviewing the documents pertaining to the construction of our network, including the construction and
use permit. As a result, we may face difficulties establishing conclusive ownership of a portion of our
cable network in the future. While current market practice allows us the continued use of our entire
cable network despite not holding adequate use permits, we cannot guarantee that this practice will
continue to remain in effect. In addition, certain construction and use permits in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Montenegro, may be incomplete or deficient.

_Bulgaria_

Our mobile network in Bulgaria is supported by numerous base station transmission systems (“BTS”).
Given the regulations that govern such equipment and the various permits required to operate
Vivacom’s BTS, we cannot be certain that our right to use a portion of its BTS will not be challenged.
While we do not generally believe that the lack of any single permit or approval with respect to our
BTS would have a material adverse effect on Vivacom’s network, the prohibition of the use of a material
number of BTS or any strategically located BTS that cannot be easily replaced by a competent authority
could have a disruptive effect on our transmission to certain areas, which could result in a material
adverse effect on our business.

_Croatia_

While we have title to use its communication network in Croatia, due to different construction related
regimes changing over time, we cannot confirm that we hold valid use permits for parts of its
communication network. Although current market practice allows the continued use of the entire
network despite not holding adequate permits for each site, we cannot guarantee that this practice will
continue. Should existing requirements to hold such permits be more strictly enforced in the future, and
should we be unable to obtain such permits, our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flow might be negatively affected.

_Slovenia_

Mainly due to different approaches to building our communication networks and numerous takeovers
of local operators in the past, we may not currently have title to use certain parts of our communication
network in Slovenia. While the current market practice allows us the continued use of our entire
communications network in Slovenia despite this, we cannot guarantee that this practice will continue
to remain in effect, and we may incur additional costs in respect of obtaining (or failing to obtain) title
to use every part of our communication network.

Furthermore, a portion of our communication network in Slovenia is not registered in the Slovenian
Public Utilities Cadastre. While we are taking actions to make all appropriate registration, it cannot be
excluded that, among other things, a fine ranging from €50 thousand to €400 thousand could be imposed
on us for failure to register.

_Greece_

In Greece, we rent part of our network from OTE (Cosmote) and other operators. This is subject to
certain regulatory risks, including limits on retail prices imposed by the Greek government.

_Lease Agreements_

In addition, we depend on lease agreements for some parts of our communication network in Slovenia,
Croatia, Serbia and Greece, as well as on national roaming agreements for parts of our communication


-----

network in some of the countries in which we operate, and we may be exposed to increase in costs
associated with and termination of such agreements. For example, in 2018 we experienced an increase
in the rent we pay for utility poles from the Serbian Electricity Utility Company from between €10 and
€12.2 to between €20 and €25 per pole per year.

Any of the above risks, if realized, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_We may not realize any or all of the adjustments to Pro Forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Adjusted_**
**_EBITDAaL included in this offering memorandum._**

This offering memorandum presents pro forma adjusted financial data which includes various
assumptions. See “Summary of Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas Historical,
_Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain Other Financial Data” for additional details regarding_
these pro forma adjustments to Pro Forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Adjusted EBITDAaL and their
underlying assumptions. These assumptions are based on our current estimates, and they involve risks,
uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed
or implied by such pro forma adjusted financial data. This offering memorandum presents estimated
Pro Forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Adjusted EBITDAaL figures that result from certain
assumptions and adjustments that we have made for (i) the acquisition of Optima Telekom as well as
for a number of smaller acquisitions, that are derived from the management accounts of the respective
targets and that include certain assumptions and adjustments, (ii) the expected results of Tessa Energy
based on management’s assumptions regarding, among others, its investment in the Kremena Wind
Park, (iii) the estimated effect on our results from certain synergies expected to be generated following
the acquisition of Vestnik Telegraf, (iv) the estimated results generated by Wind Hellas’ fiber network
business that was transferred FiberCo, and (v) the estimated effect on our results from certain synergies
expected to be generated following completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition, including cost savings
expected to be generated from the integration of Wind Hellas and Nova, and revenue expected to be
generated from existing Wind Hellas’ contracts with the Greek government relating to the connectivity
procurement program SYZEFXIS II. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties
and may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of our actions and
initiatives for the period presented. The pro forma adjustments to Pro Forma Run-Rate Last Two
Quarter Adjusted EBITDAaL include adjustments for annualized synergies, cost savings related to
overhead costs, staff costs, production costs and multiplex costs, accounting adjustments due to
differences between our accounting policies and the accounting policies of the acquired companies, and
adjustments for the annualized effect of price increases. There can be no assurance that we will realize
anticipated additional revenue, synergies and cost savings in a timely manner or at all. Some of the
factors that could cause our future financial performance to differ materially from that expressed or
implied by such pro forma adjusted financial data include: not achieving the level of EBITDA and/or
the level of revenue and/or cost savings that we expect, failing to achieve our anticipated level of
subscriber growth, changes in the accounting principles or policies that are applied, lower than
anticipated prices for our services or if the relevant acquisitions are delayed or not completed in whole
or in part. If any of these factors or others cause our actual financial performance to differ significantly
from that implied by the pro forma financial data presented, they could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to_**
**_accurately or timely report our results of operations, and the trading price and liquidity of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes could be negatively impacted thereby._**

Our internal controls over financial reporting are intended to ensure we maintain accurate records,
promote the accurate and timely reporting of our financial information, maintain adequate control over
our assets, and detect unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets. Effective internal and
disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully


-----

as a business. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
controls.

In recent years, we have significantly expanded the size and scope of our operations, including through
acquisitions in new geographical jurisdictions and in new areas of business, and we intend to continue
such growth. As we expand the size and scope of our Group, there is an increased risk that our internal
controls may not mature at the same pace. For example, some of the processes related to internal
controls may be new for personnel in certain newly acquired subsidiaries or newly entered jurisdictions
in our structure, and in the case of acquisitions, may take time to be fully implemented. Furthermore,
maintenance of internal controls may become more difficult as certain of the entities we have acquired
or may acquire may prepare their financial statements in accordance with local accounting rules rather
than IFRS. As we grow, the required sophistication of our internal controls and accounting and financial
reporting functions will also need to expand to ensure our internal controls remain adequate. Moreover,
recently adopted and complex accounting standards and interpretations, such as IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and
IFRS 16, the amendments to IFRS 2 and IFRIC 23, have created new and more demanding requirements
for financial reporting and disclosures, which require further development of our internal controls.

In prior years, our auditors auditing our financial statements under International Standards on Auditing
identified certain significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. A significant
deficiency in internal control, as defined under International Standards on Auditing, is a deficiency or
combination of deficiencies in internal control that, in an independent auditors’ professional judgment,
is of sufficient importance to merit the attention of those charged with governance. This definition
differs from the definition that would be applied if an audit was conducted with standards applicable in
the United States. The significant deficiencies identified related to deficiencies in the size of our
accounting and financial reporting functions, deficiencies in the number of qualified personnel with
IFRS accounting experience employed in those functions, deficiencies in controls to ensure that all
significant transactions affecting the Group, whether initiated within or outside of its perimeter, are
comprehensively analyzed and, where necessary, appropriately recognized and disclosed in the
financial statements, deficiencies in controls over user access to our critical information technology,
deficiencies in processes and controls relating to capitalization, commencement of depreciation and
assessing the useful lives and in respect of property, plant and equipment, deficiencies in accounting
for certain potential tax exposures and deficiencies in the process of application of the new accounting
standards.

If our internal controls do not keep pace with growth in the size and sophistication of our businesses
and the applicable financial reporting framework, we may not be able to implement and maintain
adequate internal controls. If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal controls, it could
result in material misstatements in our financial statements or failure to meet our reporting obligations
in a timely manner, which may cause a loss of confidence in our reported financial information and
could have a negative impact on the trading price and liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_We may face difficulties in increasing our subscriber base or our subscription fees or up selling new_**
**_products to current subscribers._**

Our revenue growth primarily results from the growth of our subscriber base and increase in our
subscription fees. We may not be able to sustain the level of subscriber growth, and further increases in
subscription fees may meet customer resistance and lead to increases in churn rates. If we are unable to
execute our business strategy, the Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony
markets in the regions in which we operate do not continue to grow as we expect, or we encounter other
unforeseen difficulties in acquiring new subscribers or selling additional products and services to
existing subscribers, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Additionally, a number of free television channels are available across the markets in which we operate.
Historically, the migration of subscribers from unmanaged free terrestrial television has been slow.


-----

While we believe that our product offering is of a higher quality than the television channels available
free of charge, there can be no assurance that the speed with which customers migrate from free
television services to Pay-TV services will increase, and consequently, we cannot guarantee that PayTV penetration rates across Southeastern Europe will converge on the higher penetration rates
characteristic of other major Western European markets which may, in turn, adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Customer churn may adversely affect our financial performance._**

Customer churn refers to those subscribers who cease subscribing to one or more of our products and
services. In the ordinary course of our business, we experience a loss of customers due to their choice
to obtain services from a competitor (including from competing types of services, such as OTT TV
services in lieu of cable Pay-TV, or mobile-telephony in lieu of fixed-line service), relocation of our
customers to areas not covered by our network and cancellation of services for customers who, after
several reminders, do not pay our invoices. For example, our annual cable Pay-TV subscriber churn
rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were 8% for our Slovenia Group segment, 11% for
our Serbia Group segment, 7% for our Bosnia Group segment and 11% for our Bulgaria Group segment
(based on IPTV subscribers).

Factors impacting churn in our consumer subscriber base include existing customers moving outside of
our current geographical area of service as well as termination of services contracts by us due to existing
customers’ inability to pay, as well as competition. For example, any interruption of our services, the
removal or unavailability of programming or any other customer service problems, whether or not
attributable to us, could contribute to increased subscriber churn or cause us to fail in our goal of
reducing the level of churn of our Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony
services. Additionally, price increases (by us or across the industry) could lead to increased subscriber
churn.

Subscriber churn reduces our subscription base and causes us to incur additional costs to replace the
cancelled subscribers, such as advertising and marketing costs. A significant increase in our churn rates
may require us to incur additional costs to replace subscribers lost to cancellation. Additionally, even
with increased marketing efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace the subscribers
who left us at all. Therefore, if a significant number of our subscribers cancel or do not renew their
contracts with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
affected. Additionally, we incur upfront cash expenses for the installation of our cable TV and internet
equipment and handset subsidies with new customers which we recoup over the duration of the services
contract. As a result, should an increased number of subscribers cancel our services before we can
recoup these initial cash expenses, this would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our marketing and advertising expenses may increase in the future._**

Historically, we have had low marketing and advertising budgets and have competed on the quality of
our content and services instead. Should we be unable to compete on the quality of our content and
services in the future, for example, as a result of loss of content to our competitors, we may need to
increase our marketing and advertising efforts, which would lead to an increase in marketing expenses.
If we are unable to offset such increases in marketing and advertising expenses with increased prices
for our products and services, our profitability, results of operations and financial condition may be
negatively affected.

**_Failure in our technology or telecommunications systems as a result of technical errors, cyber_**
**_security breaches or other factors could significantly disrupt our operations._**

Our success depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology,
HFC network systems, mobile network and customer service centers. If any part of our HFC network,
mobile network or IT infrastructure or any of our customer service centers is compromised or damaged


-----

by flood, fire or other natural disaster, terrorism, illegal piracy, power loss, system failure, denial of
service attack, cyber-attack or other catastrophe, our operations could be materially adversely affected.
Disaster recovery, security and service continuity protection measures that we currently have or may in
the future undertake, and our monitoring of network performance, may be insufficient to prevent losses.

In addition, our business is dependent on sophisticated critical systems, such as our customer service
systems and billing systems. Despite the presence of back-up systems, we can provide no assurances
that our network and technical systems will not be damaged by physical or electronic breakdowns,
cyber-attacks, computer viruses or similar disruptions. In addition, unforeseen problems may create
disruptions in our information technology systems. There can be no assurance that our existing security
system, security policy, back-up systems, physical access security and access protection, user
administration and emergency plans will be sufficient to prevent data loss or minimize network
downtime. Sustained or repeated disruptions or damage to our network and technical systems that
prevent, interrupt, delay or make it more difficult for us to provide products and services to our
customers in accordance with the agreements we have with our customers may trigger claims for
payment of damages or contractual remedies and would cause considerable damage to our reputation,
lead to the loss of customers and require repairs or replacement of part of our network, all of which
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we rely on hardware, software, technical services and customer support provided by third
parties. While we have support and maintenance agreements in place with our existing vendors, we do
not control the proper functioning of such third-party equipment, and to the extent hardware, software,
technical services and customer support provided by third parties fails, our business operations may be
adversely affected. For example, our mobile operations in Croatia were recently disrupted due to
technical problems with our mobile network.

Further, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, penetration by viruses, worms or other
destructive or disruptive software, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information
maintained in our information technology systems (or those of our business partners) and networks,
including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation, result in legal and/or
regulatory action against us, and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy
any such security breach. The occurrence of any such network or information system related events or
security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We operate in a capital intensive business that may result in depreciation or impairment costs or_**
**_prevent us from generating positive returns._**

The Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony markets in which we operate are
capital intensive and significant periodic capital investments are required to add customers to our
network, including for spectrum licenses, equipment and labor costs. In addition, an increase in our
customers’ internet usage or demand for higher bandwidth may require us to further invest in the
capacity of our network. As a result, we expect that the deployment of our 5G network in our countries
of operations, technological innovation as well as ongoing customer growth will lead to additional
capital expenditure in the future. In addition, any new or enhanced products or services we introduce,
including internet and telephony products, may require an upgrade of local and in-house networks, in
which case we may be required to cover a portion, or all, of the costs of such upgrade. Our current
assumptions regarding the costs associated with the maintenance and further development of our cable
and mobile networks, including the implementation of new standards, may prove to be inaccurate. No
assurance can be given that our future investments and network upgrades will generate a positive return
or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such future upgrades. In addition, rapidly
changing technology requires careful review of life cycles for our assets and may result in additional
depreciation or impairment costs. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with
adding new customers, obtaining spectrum license, expanding or upgrading our network or making our
other planned or unplanned capital expenditure, or if we experience unexpected material depreciation
or impairment costs, or do not manage our project portfolio effectively to ensure the proper allocation


-----

of resources between projects, our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be
harmed.

**_We depend on third-party providers of hardware, software, satellite services, network access and_**
**_customer support._**

We rely on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of customer equipment such as
receiver boxes, hardware, including mobile handsets, software, satellite services, and operational or
technical support necessary to operate our network and systems and provide our services.

In many cases, our services depend on the technical specifications of equipment or software of a
particular provider such as the method of content encryption, making it difficult for us to quickly change
supply, maintenance or other essential relationships in the event that our provider refuses to offer us
favorable prices, fails to provide the support that we require, or ceases to produce equipment or provide
satisfactory customer service. Additionally, if our suppliers were to discontinue certain products or
services, were unable to provide equipment to meet our specifications or interrupt the provision of
equipment or services to us, or seek to charge us prices that are not competitive or withdraw discounts
that have been previously agreed, we may have to find alternative suppliers. Switching to alternative
suppliers could cause us to experience difficulties or delays, or to incur significant costs, or if we were
unable to replace such services or products in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our business and
profitability could be materially adversely affected.

We and Wind Hellas are party to a number of roaming agreements, under which we are provided with
network services allowing us to offer mobile-telephony services to our subscribers in areas where we
do not have our own network coverage. The loss of any of these agreements could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, an increase in the number and volume of calls by our subscribers served on the networks of
other MNOs could require future negotiations for lower national roaming/network sharing prices in
order to maintain or decrease the cost of national roaming/network sharing, which may not be
achievable. If any of the events described above were to occur, our national roaming/network sharing
or interconnection costs could increase. In the event that this disrupts our network access or coverage
in a manner which we cannot resolve through our other agreements, we may have to increase our capital
expenditure in order to extend our radio network or enter into agreements with other network access
providers on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of the terminated agreement. If any of these
events were to occur, or if we face an increase in costs incurred under one of our national
roaming/network sharing agreements, it would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and
results of operations, or, if we are not able to fund capital expenditure to extend our radio network, such
failure would affect the level of services which we can offer which could cause us to lose subscribers
or fail to attract new subscribers, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our reputation as a supplier and service provider of high-quality Pay-TV, broadband internet and_**
**_fixed-line and mobile-telephony offerings or the value associated with our brands may be adversely_**
**_affected._**

Our business depends on our reputation and our ability to maintain good relationships with our
subscribers, suppliers, employees and local regulators. The brands under which we sell our products
and services are well-recognized brands in their respective jurisdictions. In addition, we own and
operate some of the strongest brand names in the region, including Sport Klub, N1, Nova S, Grand, IDJ
and Pikaboo, together with Nova TV, Nova BH and Nova M, the leading national TV stations in Croatia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, respectively. Our reputation, brand image and competitive
advantage may be harmed either through product defects, such as the failure of our network, branded
routers and branded TV equipment (including failures or defects of equipment provided by third
parties), or shortfalls in our customer service, such as a failure to provide reliable product maintenance


-----

or assist with connection problems. Any harm done to our reputation, business relationships or brand
value as a result of our actions, or actions of others could have a significant negative effect on us and
on the value of our brands which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, our relationships with our subscribers are of particular importance. Subscribers generally
judge our performance through their interactions with the staff at our monitoring centers, the reliability
of our products and our maintenance performance for any products that require repair. If we fail to meet
our subscribers’ expectations, we may lose subscribers or have greater difficulty attracting new
subscribers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. We have also experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, a slightly negative
perception of our brand by certain groups of the population in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of
the recent political history of the region and our perceived Serbian identity. Any damage to the value
of our brands caused by any of the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by the alleged health risks of antenna sites and the use of_**
**_mobile telephones._**

We are aware of allegations that there may be health risks associated with the effects of electromagnetic
signals from antenna sites, mobile telephones and other telecommunications devices. We cannot
provide assurances that further medical research and studies will not establish a link between the radio
frequency emissions of mobile handsets or telecommunications base stations and these health concerns.
The European Commission has been investigating these concerns since 1995. Should such allegations
prove correct, regulatory authorities in our countries of operation could increase regulation of mobile
telephones and telecommunications base stations. Additionally, the actual or perceived risk of
telecommunications devices, press reports about risks or any litigation relating to such risks could
adversely affect us through a reduction in the size or growth rate of our customer base, a decline in
usage by our customers or through increased litigation costs and could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to attract or retain personnel who are key to our business._**

We depend on our key management and personnel, including our founder and chairman of our advisory
board, Dragan Šolak, all of whom we believe are highly skilled and many of whom have been with our
various businesses since their inception. As the markets in which we operate are highly competitive,
there is significant competition in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the telecommunications
industry, especially individuals with experience in the cable sector. Despite our key management and
personnel’s long history of service and involvement in and commitment to our business, we cannot
assure you that we will be successful in retaining the services of our key management or personnel or
that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays.
As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could cause significant disruptions to our business
operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The operation of our business depends in part on agreements with our competitors._**

While we compete with Telekom Srbija, Telekom Slovenije, the incumbent Bulgarian and Bosnian
operators and Crnogorski (Montenegrin) Telekom in the respective television, internet and telephony
markets, we also rely on long-term services and assets provided by them. For example, we lease cable
duct space used for parts of our cable network and purchase telephony interconnection services and
mobile network services from Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, and rely on lease agreements with
Telekom Srbija and HT Eronet for cable duct space and the use of their fixed telephone lines in Serbia
and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, Telekom Slovenije provides us with fiber optic connection
lines for certain areas. In addition, we have interconnection agreements with our Bulgarian competitors,
including collocation agreements, and rely on lease agreements with them for fiber optic connection


-----

lines for certain areas in Bulgaria. In Croatia, we have national roaming agreements, site sharing
agreements and leased line agreements with Croatian Telekom, as well as site sharing agreements,
leased line agreements and dark fiber agreements with A1. In Greece, we have network access
agreements with OTE (Cosmote) and other operators. Wind Hellas is also party to certain agreements
with key competitors, including a network sharing agreement with Vodafone. In addition, Wind Hellas
is party to the Victus Joint Operation, a 50/50 joint venture with Vodafone Greece to facilitate partial
sharing of 2G, 3G and 4G mobile networks, mostly in rural and limited urban areas of Greece.
Moreover, Wind Hellas is party to a long-term master service agreement with Vantage Tower Greece
in relation to the tower portfolios that Wind Hellas and Vodafone Greece both contributed into Vantage
Towers Greece in 2020, as part of the Vantage Towers Disposal.

Our ability to offer our services to our customers depends on the performance of the respective partner
of their obligations under the applicable lease and services agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such
lease and services agreements, the respective other party has the right to terminate the services under
the agreements in certain circumstances and under certain conditions or has the right to unilaterally
increase prices. For example, in 2011, Telekom Srbija significantly raised prices for the use of their
duct space. The termination of any material portion or all of such lease or service agreements would
require us to find alternative solutions and it may be difficult to establish an alternative at a reasonable
price, which would adversely affect the value of our business. Additionally, our business relationships
with our state-owned competitors might be affected by a close alignment between the state’s interests
and our competitor’s business operations as a result of which our competitors might, for example, enjoy
special privileges with regulatory authorities. Additionally, should we be unable to successfully
negotiate moderate price increases, or should we be unable to pass through price increases to our
customers, our profitability, financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected.

**_We may not be successful in maintaining the necessary regulatory authorization or licenses needed_**
**_to operate our business and such authorizations and licenses may be invalid or may be subject to_**
**_termination, revocation or material alterations in the event of a breach or to promote public interest._**

We currently hold numerous regulatory authorizations and licenses necessary to operate our business.
In addition, we hold numerous radio frequency licenses in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Croatia. We cannot
assure you that all of our authorizations or licenses are valid, that we will be able to maintain all
authorizations and licenses necessary to operate our business or that we will be able to renew our
authorizations or licenses when they expire. The loss of any of our authorizations or licenses or a
material modification of the terms of any existing or renewed licenses may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. For example, some
competitors successfully challenged before the Slovenian administrative court the grant of a block of
spectrum in 2008 to Tušmobil (which in April 2015 was acquired by, and later merged into, Telemach
Slovenia), which we used for part of our 3G mobile services. AKOS organized a renewed tender in
November 2021 for the remaining duration of the initial allocation of the spectrum in question (i.e.,
until April 2023), which was won by T-2, one of our competitors in Slovenia. We did not participate in
the renewed tender because we believe the spectrum we acquired in 2014, 2016 and April 2021 (each
with a 15-year license) is sufficient for our spectrum requirements.

Additionally, like all other broadcasters, we must comply with national broadcasting laws and
regulations, and the terms and conditions of our licenses in order to maintain our licenses. If we are held
to be in material breach of any applicable law or the terms and conditions of our licenses, our licenses
may be revoked. In addition, if our activity under our licenses is carried out in a manner that is deemed
to conflict with applicable law or the terms and conditions of our licenses, and we fail to remedy such
conflict within the applicable grace period, our licenses may be revoked. Any revocation of our licenses
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_We may be unable to secure spectrum in the future, which would prevent or impair our plans or limit_**
**_the need for our services and products._**


-----

Our ability to provide certain services to customers is highly dependent on our access to sufficient
spectrum. However, the amount of available spectrum suitable for our operations is limited and the
process for obtaining it is complex. We therefore cannot guarantee that we, or our customers, will have
sufficient access to spectrum to maintain and develop our services in the future. We believe that
spectrum licenses will be particularly important for competing for 4G and 5G networks during the next
five to ten years, and to that end we have successfully acquired 5G spectrum in Bulgaria, Slovenia and
Croatia. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to outbid competitors for
blocks of frequency in spectrum bands in future auctions. In addition, should the governments of the
countries in which we operate decide to reallocate spectrum to 5G, then we may be required to obtain
additional spectrum to maintain our existing product offering. We believe that spectrum success in any
future spectrum auctions will be pivotal to meet the growing capacity demand in the mobile market and
to accommodate new 5G services.

In addition, a new mobile network operator could successfully enter the mobile telecommunications
market in the countries in which we operate. Although the long-term nature of the licenses granted in
spectrum auctions could constitute significant barriers to entry for potential new competitors, a new
MNO could develop and operate a network infrastructure in a specific geographical region in which we
operate.

If any new MNO were to successfully enter our mobile telecommunications market as a competitor or
existing operators were to combine or share their resources or infrastructure, it could materially reduce
our market share and could overall have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_EU regulation of the levels of roaming charges may in the future have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business._**

EU regulators have imposed price restrictions applicable to all operators in the EU (both at the retail
and wholesale level). In particular, in 2007, the European Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 of the European
Parliament and the European Council of June 27, 2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks
within the European Community (the “Community”) amending Directive 2002/21/EC came into effect,
as well as, in 2009, Regulation (EC) No 544/2009 of the European Parliament and of the European
Council of June 18, 2009 was introduced amending Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 on roaming on public
mobile telephone networks within the Community. Both provided for a steady reduction in mobile retail
and wholesale prices for voice calls, SMS and data. On June 13, 2012, however, Regulation (EC) No
544/2009 was repealed by Regulation (EU) No. 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
European Council of June 13, 2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the
EU. Pursuant to the latter regulation, the maximum retail prices and average wholesale prices for
roaming mobile services (calls, mobile data and SMS) decreased on July 1, 2013 and decreased further
on July 1, 2014, and were fully eliminated on June 15, 2017. Additionally, a “decoupling regime” has
been introduced to increase competition in the international roaming market, and the result has been a
reduction in international roaming retail prices to below the regulatory caps. This “decoupling regime”
came into effect on July 1, 2014 and introduced market participants in the form of alternative roaming
providers. Additionally, the “decoupling regime” foresees local break out services (the ability for
foreign MNOs to target our outbound roaming customers to directly offer them data only services on
their networks). Such services would be paid directly by such roaming customer to the visited roaming
network.

Furthermore, certain countries in the region, including Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
Montenegro, are party to a regional initiative for a phased reduction of roaming prices between such
countries. In the region, from July 1, 2019, mobile calls cost €0.19 per minute, SMS service costs €0.06
per message and mobile data costs €0.18 per megabyte (all prices exclusive of VAT). Pursuant to this
initiative, as of July 1, 2021, roaming costs were abolished between Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Serbia. This shift could create increased price pressure on
roaming charges that forces us to lower our prices further to match the market standard or risk losing


-----

customers to other providers. Reduction of prices of mobile roaming services, as well as operation of
alternative roaming providers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions
and results of operations.

**_There can be no assurance that our countries of operations will continue to successfully implement_**
**_their respective political and economic reforms and agendas._**

In recent years, certain countries in which we operate have implemented significant political and
economic reforms aimed at, inter alia, reducing economic and structural imbalances, increasing the
flexibility of their respective economies, including liberalization of the media and telecommunications
sectors and creating a business friendly environment that is conducive to foreign investment.

While Slovenia joined the European Union in 2004 and has generally made the transition to a
functioning market economy, the political and economic reforms implemented by the respective
governments of Croatia, despite having joined the European Union in 2013, and of Serbia, Montenegro,
North Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are at a less developed stage than Slovenia.

Since the end of the Yugoslav wars in 1995, the countries formerly comprising Yugoslavia have made
significant progress towards becoming more democratic and liberalized market economies; however,
building Serbia’s, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s, Montenegro’s, Croatia’s and North Macedonia’s political
and economic systems and infrastructure to a CEE or Western European standard will require further
investment and may take some years to complete. We cannot assure you that Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia and North Macedonia will achieve their intended aims with the
implemented reforms, that a political environment supportive of these reforms will be maintained or
that the governments in the respective countries will not implement regulations or fiscal or monetary
policies, or otherwise take actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Additionally, the key risk to stability in Serbia remains the status of Kosovo’s independence, and the
country’s history of political instability makes it difficult to predict the occurrence of events or
circumstances, such as war or hostilities, and no assurance can be given that we would be able to sustain
our current profit levels in Serbia if adverse political events or circumstances were to occur.

Although Bulgaria, a former communist country which joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007, has
an open economy that historically has demonstrated strong growth, economic headwinds remain in the
near and long-term. Corruption in public administration, a weak judiciary, weak productivity, a lack of
transparency in public procurements, an uncertain political environment and the presence of organized
crime present significant challenges to sustainable economic growth in Bulgaria.

Following completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition, we will significantly expand our presence in
Greece. Although since 2017 the Greek economic and business environment has gradually improved
and all capital controls were removed in 2019, Greece’s economic recovery is still subject to
uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on local businesses
as well as on the tourism sector, which is critical for Greece. Any deterioration in Greek macroeconomic
and political conditions, including unemployment, interest rates, inflation, rates of taxes and GDP level,
could lead to a reduction in our customers’ disposal income, which could reduce demand for our product
and impair our ability to collect receivables.

The foregoing political and economic challenges in the countries in which we operate could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may become subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale._**

The European Union competition framework imposes pricing and other potential requirements on
entities deemed to have significant market power (“SMP”) in non-competitive relevant markets in
which they operate. Among other markets, the European Commission has identified “wholesale
broadband access” and “the termination on an individual fixed network” as relevant markets. The


-----

European Union competition framework has been implemented in Slovenia and Bulgaria; Croatia has
largely aligned its law with the EU requirements; and Serbia, albeit not yet an EU Member State,
continues its efforts to harmonize its law with the European framework and has recently promulgated
new rules applicable to the electronic communications sector.

In Slovenia, we are deemed to have SMP in: (i) voice call termination in an individual public mobile
telephone network (inter operator market) and (ii) call termination in an individual telephone network
at a fixed location (inter operator market). In Bulgaria, we have been deemed to have SMP in the
following regulated markets: (i) termination on fixed network, (ii) call termination for mobile voice
service and (iii), until June 2019, local access provided at a fixed location wholesale access provided at
a fixed location. In Croatia, we have been deemed to have SMP in the market for voice call termination
in an individual public mobile telephone network. In Serbia, we are currently deemed to have SMP on
the wholesale market for call termination in public telephone networks on fixed location and the
wholesale market of central access service provided on a fixed location for mass market products. In
Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Montenegro, we were also determined to have SMP on the wholesale
market for call termination in the individual public network at a fixed location.

In Greece, Nova is deemed to have SMP in wholesale call termination on its own individual public
telephone network provided at a fixed location, like all other major Greek operators (i.e., OTE
(Cosmote) and Vodafone). Wind Hellas is also deemed to have SMP in: (i) wholesale call termination
on individual public telephone networks provided at a fixed location; and (ii) wholesale voice call
termination on individual mobile networks.

Being designated as having SMP may carry with it: an obligation to publish data from accounting
records, technical specifications, network characteristics, terms and conditions for supply and use or
validity periods of offers and prices; an obligation to only engage in non-discriminatory conduct; an
obligation to keep separate accounts for interconnection and access services; an obligation to provide
access and use of parts of our network infrastructure and associated facilities to third parties; price
controls and cost based accounting; an obligation to make available a minimum set of leased lines; an
obligation to offer operator selection and operator pre-selection services; and regulation of retail
services, including an obligation to unbundle products and services.

There is a risk that we could be found to have SMP in other geographical markets in which we operate
if local regulators identify these areas as relevant markets in which there is not sufficient competition.
The designation of our business as an SMP provider could result in requiring us to provide other service
providers access to our network for purposes of providing competing broadband and broadcasting
services at regulated prices, and impose other restrictions on how we operate our network and market
our services, including the imposition of a requirement to obtain additional permits and licenses for our
operations. Granting such access would limit the bandwidth available to us to provide other products
and services to our customers. Such regulation could, among other things, impair our ability to use our
bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue, create a shortage of capacity on our network,
which could limit the types and variety of services we could provide to our customers, strengthen our
competitors by granting them access in our network and lowering their costs to offer competing products
and services and have a significant adverse impact on our profitability.

In Greece, we currently act as universal service provider, which also imposes certain regulatory
obligations on us.

Furthermore, we may be subject to fines for infringement of relevant local competition laws. For
example, we have been subject to competition proceedings in Bosnia related to our provision of sports
content, and in 2015 and 2017, United Media Distribution, a former subsidiary of the Group, was fined
by approximately €250,000 for an allegation of continuing abuse of dominance. More recently, in 2020
and 2021, Bosnian competition authorities fined United Media by approximately €190,000 for alleged
abuse of dominance related to our broadcasting of Sport Klub. We have challenged these decisions in
court. We have taken steps to address the concerns of the competition authorities, including by offering


-----

our sports content to third parties on terms that are comparable to those that we offer to our Group
companies. However, certain competitors and the association of cable operators in Bosnia and
Herzegovina have alleged that United Media has not complied with the decisions of the Bosnian
competition authorities.

In addition, we are subject to proceedings in Slovenia related to competition rules connected to alleged
abuse of dominant market position and with respect to certain of our acquisitions, and there can be no
guarantee that we will not be subject to similar proceedings again in Slovenia or other jurisdictions in
which we operate in the future. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings—Sport Klub Divestiture Ruling
_and Investigation of Alleged Abuse of Dominant Position.”_

We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to further regulatory scrutiny in respect of: (i) our
market position in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece
or any other jurisdiction in which we operate, (ii) matters involving merger control filings or (iii)
exclusive and restrictive content contracts, and may be liable to pay fines or other sanctions in the future,
especially as local law and local customs continue to be updated based on CEE or Western European
legal standards.

**_Changes in labor laws may make it more costly to operate our business in the future._**

We are exposed to the risk of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. While the substantial
majority of our employees currently are not members of labor unions, we cannot guarantee that a larger
portion of our employees will not associate with such unions in the future, especially as the labor
standards in our countries of operations converge with CEE or Western European standards. As a result,
we might also become subject to collective bargaining agreements which could regulate, inter alia, the
general labor conditions of our employees, working hours, holidays, termination, provisions and general
payment schemes for wages. Moreover, strikes and other industrial actions, as well as the negotiation
of collective bargaining agreements or salary increases in the future, could disrupt our operations and
make it more costly to operate our facilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, our business operations might be negatively affected by changes in local labor law and
labor market practice, such as the imposition of, or increases in, minimum wages, or a more restrictive
interpretation of the status of alternative hiring arrangements as employment. While we believe we are
currently in line with local, regional and national labor market practices, there can be no assurance that
labor laws, market practice, or enforcement focus, will not change. Should we fail to comply with
relevant labor laws and regulations, we might be exposed to fines which could have a negative impact
on our profitability, financial condition and result of operations.

**_Sensitive customer data is an important part of our daily business and leakage of such data may_**
**_violate laws and regulations which could result in fines reputational damage and customer churn,_**
**_and adversely affect our business._**

In the normal course of our business, we accumulate, store and use data which is protected by data
protection laws. The data protection authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have the right
to audit us and impose fines if they find we have not complied with the applicable laws and adequately
protected customer data. Although we take industry standard precautions to protect customer data in
accordance with the applicable privacy requirements, we cannot exclude the possibility that sensitive
data may leak in the future due to human error, technological failure, database piracy, security breaches
or other circumstances. We cooperate with third-party service providers, for the provision of call center
services, for example, and independent sales agents, and we cannot exclude the possibility that such
third parties could also experience system failures involving the storage or transmission of proprietary
information. In addition, although the terms of our contracts restrict the usage of customer data and we
perform pre-contractual due diligence, we cannot guarantee that third parties will abide by the
contractual terms. Violation of data protection laws by such third parties or ourselves may result in


-----

fines, reputational damage and customer churn, as well as the misappropriation of confidential
information, interruptions in our operations and damage to hardware infrastructure, and may adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although we have implemented significant technical and operational measures, we may be exposed to
database piracy or other database security breaches which could result in the leakage and unauthorized
dissemination of information about our subscribers, including their names, addresses, home phone
numbers, individual tax numbers and other personal data. Even though we have data breach response
plans in place, the breach of security of our database and illegal sale or other unauthorized release of
our subscribers’ personal information could materially adversely impact our reputation, prompt lawsuits
against us by individual and corporate subscribers, lead to violations of data protection laws and adverse
actions by the telecommunications regulators and other authorities, lead to a loss in subscribers and
hinder our ability to attract new subscribers. For example, in June 2020 we detected that Telemach
Croatia had been affected by a cyber-intrusion and breach of its customers’ personal data site in early
2020, in which certain personal data became available to third parties. Although there is no evidence
that any personal data was actually extracted from the relevant servers, we have reported the event to
the applicable regulators and taken remedial steps to prevent future breaches. We do not currently
expect any financial consequences stemming from the breach, but we cannot rule out such outcomes in
the future. If severe customer data security breaches are detected, regulatory authorities may sanction
us, and such sanctions can include suspension of operations for some time period. In addition, we may
be exposed to cyber-attacks, which could result in equipment failures or disruptions in our operations.
Our inability to operate our network as a result of such events may result in significant expense or loss
of market shares. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to European data protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate
numerous important aspects of our business and place material constraints on our interactions with
consumers. The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU/2016/679, “GDPR”), entered into
force on May 25, 2018 and covers legal areas relating to the protection as well as the free movement of
personal data and provides for potential penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual
turnover for cases of non-compliance. As data protection authorities continue to release guidance on
the implementation of GDPR obligations, the legal framework will evolve and best practice examples
will continue to emerge and may require us to adapt our policies in compliance. GDPR requires us to
ensure that data minimization is embedded across the Group so that only the appropriate amount of data
required for any particular purpose is processed, that we delete any unnecessary datasets and that we
anonymize data wherever possible. The implementation of these obligations creates increased
compliance risk that may lead to regulatory intervention. For example, in 2018, Telemach Slovenia was
subject to proceedings initiated by AKOS concerning the storage of traffic data relating to pre-paid
users and the implementation of measures for the timely deletion of, and prevention of unauthorized
access to, subscriber data which could have resulted in a fine ranging between €50,000 and €400,000.
In these proceedings, Telemach Slovenia was found to be compliant. In addition, any irregularities
could expose us to claims for damages by subscribers.

Furthermore, we provide mobile, broadband and landline voice services to a number of public and
private financial institutions, government entities and corporate customers with data security
requirements. These customers may continue to increase their data security requirements, and we may
be required to undertake additional investments in order to adhere to these enhanced data security
requirements, as well as evolving statutory and regulatory requirements, including obtaining and
maintaining certain ISO certifications, improving access rights management systems and developing a
corporate data encryption infrastructure. As a result, we may undertake additional capital expenditure
to satisfy data security requirements. If we are unable to satisfy such data security requirements,
customers could decide to terminate their contracts with us, and such terminations may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_We are involved in a number of civil, administrative and criminal legal proceedings which, if_**
**_adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability,_**
**_or could lead to reputational damage that could have a material impact on our business._**

From time to time, we may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or
investigations, including by governmental bodies, licensing authorities, customers, suppliers,
competitors, former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. Should any of these matters be
decided against us, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and
on our financial condition. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse
judgments or outcomes to these proceedings or claims, and to take all necessary steps to adequately
defend our interests, although it is difficult to predict final outcomes with any degree of certainty and
we can offer no assurances in this regard.

We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of
our business, including disputes related to intellectual property rights. Please see “Our Business—Legal
_Proceedings.”_

From time to time, we may also become involved in litigation matters or other proceedings pending
against or relate to entities that we acquire. For example, KATV HS d.o.o. and HKB net d.o.o., two
small cable operators in Bosnia and Herzegovina that we acquired in July 2015, are subject to disputes
with their minority shareholders relating to a prior sale of these companies. The outcome of these
disputes is difficult to anticipate and could have an adverse effect on our financial position and
profitability if the final, non-appealable judgments in these matters are not consistent with our current
expectations.

Further, Telemach Slovenia, as successor to Tušmobil, which we acquired in April 2015, has had certain
criminal proceedings pending against its then-owner Mirko Tuš and former head of AKOS (Tomaž
Simonič) since 2015. A final court decision in February 2019 recognized that the statute of limitations
had expired for Telemach Slovenia. Although following this decision Telemach Slovenia can no longer
be found to be criminally liable, Telemach Slovenia may still be required to make an indemnification
payment as a recipient of an alleged illegal benefit, if any of the other alleged offenders (against whom
the criminal proceedings are still continuing) are found to be criminally liable. In February 2020, the
first instance court acquitted Tomaž Simonič of the charges in the amended bill of indictment regarding
misuse of public positions or rights. In December 2020, upon the public prosecutor’s appeal, the Higher
Court of Ljubljana annulled this judgment and returned the case to the first instance court for retrial.
The outcome of these proceedings, although difficult to predict, could have a material adverse effect on
our financial position and profitability if the final, non-appealable judgment in this matter is not
consistent with our current expectations, and we are not able to successfully recover such amounts from
Tušmobil’s seller. In addition, Telemach Slovenia had certain administrative proceedings against it in
which the grant of a block of spectrum which we used for part of our 3G mobile services was
successfully challenged in front of the Slovenian administrative court. As a result, AKOS organized a
renewed tender in November 2021 for the remaining duration of the initial allocation of the spectrum
in question, which was won by T-2, one of our competitors in Slovenia. We did not participate in the
renewed tender because we believe the spectrum we acquired in 2014, 2016 and April 2021 (each with
a 15-year license) is sufficient for our spectrum requirements.

In addition, we are, or might become, subject to legal proceedings and investigations in various
jurisdictions, including, without limitation, the pending former Vivacom shareholder litigation in
Luxembourg or as a result of the entry into the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement. See “Our Business—
_Legal Proceedings.” We are, and will be, unable to predict an outcome, favorable or unfavorable, or to_
estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with any such legal proceedings. There is also
a risk that the former direct and indirect shareholders of the Vivacom Seller attempt to initiate other
proceedings in Bulgaria or other jurisdictions in support of the pending Luxembourg shareholder
litigation, or to attempt to reverse the consummation of, or claim damages due to, the Vivacom
Acquisition.


-----

If we are successfully joined as a defendant to legal proceedings and claims are made against us and/or
adverse developments in any on-going litigations occur, we may incur additional costs or may be
required to pay damages or similar fees. Such costs, damages or fees may be in excess of amounts for
which we are able to collect under contractual arrangements, including the Vivacom Acquisition
Agreement.

We cannot assure you that the costs, charges, liabilities or other regulatory outcomes associated with
any of the foregoing matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges, liabilities or regulatory
outcomes will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our financial statements. In future periods,
we could be subject to cash costs or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved
unfavorably to us. Additionally, any reputational damage associated with such legal or regulatory
proceedings could have a material impact on our business. See “Our Business—Legal Proceedings.”

Ongoing and future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our intellectual property rights and other security measures may not fully protect our operations._**

Some of our products contain proprietary or licensed content that is transmitted through our Pay-TV
channels. We rely on trademark, copyright and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect
our rights to this content. However, our intellectual property rights and other security measures may not
fully protect our operations, and we cannot guarantee that the intellectual property rights we rely on
will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will be
able to renew our rights to such content when the term of protection for any such trademark or copyright
expires, and any failure to protect our content, technology and know-how could result in loss of
customers to our competitors and decreased profits.

Even if our intellectual property rights remain intact, we cannot assure you that security and anti-piracy
measures will prevent unauthorized access to our services and piracy of our content. Third parties may
be able to copy, infringe or otherwise profit from our proprietary and licensed content, without our, or
the respective right holders’, authorization. The risk of piracy is especially acute in our Pay-TV business
segment. Media piracy occurs in many parts of the world, including Southeastern Europe, and is
facilitated by technological advances and the conversion of media content into digital formats, which
make it easier to create, transmit and share high-quality unauthorized copies, on videotapes and DVDs,
from pay per view through set-top boxes and through unlicensed broadcasts on free-to-air TV and the
internet. In addition, the lack of internet specific legislation relating to trademark and copyright
protection creates additional challenges for us in protecting our intellectual property rights in
cyberspace. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property may adversely affect our business by
harming our reputation and by decreasing the confidence our business partners rest in our ability to
protect our proprietary and licensed content.

**_If a third-party claims that we breached its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to make_**
**_significant expenditures to either defend ourselves against such claims, license rights to the third-_**
**_party’s technology or to identify ways to conduct our operations without breaching such rights._**

The success of our business depends to an extent on the use of intellectual property rights, in particular
rights to advanced technological solutions, software and programming content. We cannot guarantee
that we have not breached or that we will not in the future breach the intellectual property rights of third
parties. Any alleged breach could expose us to liability claims from third parties. In addition, we may
be required to obtain a license or acquire new solutions that allow us to conduct our business in a manner
that does not breach such third-party rights, and we may be forced to expend significant time, resources
and money in order to defend ourselves against such allegations. The diversion of management’s time
and resources along with potentially significant expenses that could be involved could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to increases in operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect our_**
**_earnings._**

We are subject to increasing operating costs. We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries,
wages, benefits and other administrative costs. While we aim to increase our subscription rates to offset
increases in operating costs, we may not be successful in doing so. For example, see “—We may become
_subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale.” Price increases are also associated with expenses,_
in particular, service costs. As a result, our operating costs may increase faster than associated revenues,
resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by changes to tax legislation or its interpretation or increases in_**
**_effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or challenges to our tax position._**

We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, in particular, in the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece, and are subject
to complex tax laws. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors in
addition to our operating results, including the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the
tax rates in those jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the manner in which, and extent to
which, we transfer funds to and repatriate funds from our subsidiaries, accounting standards and
changes in accounting standards, and future changes in tax law. There cannot be certainty that the
relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of relevant tax laws. If our tax positions
are challenged by the relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay
taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect
such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate and have a negative
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2019, the Serbian
Ministry of Finance Tax Authority (the “Serbian Tax Authority”) conducted a tax investigation of SBB
Serbia for the year ended December 31, 2012 and issued a penalty of €21 million which has been
deferred pending an appeal. In October 2020, the Ministry of Finance annulled this penalty and
instructed the Serbian Tax Authority to restart its investigation. See “Our Business—Legal
_Proceedings—Investigation by the Serbian Tax Authority.” As we operate in more than one tax_
jurisdiction and may therefore incur losses in one jurisdiction that cannot be offset against income
earned in a different jurisdiction, we may pay income taxes in one jurisdiction for a particular period
even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for that period. In addition, the tax systems in the
markets in which we operate are unpredictable, which gives rise to uncertainties in our tax planning.
The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_A substantial portion of our assets are represented by goodwill, and we may never realize the full_**
**_value thereof or we may be required to write down the value of our goodwill._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, including following completion of the Vivacom
Acquisition in July 2020, the Nova Acquisition in November 2020, and provisional goodwill as a result
of the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition in January 2021. We will likely record a significant
additional amount of goodwill in connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition. Total goodwill of the
Company, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses we
acquire, was €1,297.0 million, or 28% of the Company’s total assets, as of September 30, 2021. We
perform goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis, and we incurred impairment losses on
goodwill of €0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, of zero in the year ended December 31,
2019 and of €9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. A write down of our goodwill may
result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance or a decline in expected future cash
flows. If we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill is necessary, we would be
obligated to record the appropriate charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

**Risks Related to the Wind Hellas Acquisition**

**_The Wind Hellas Acquisition may entitle Wind Hellas’ customers and certain of its other business_**
**_partners to terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Wind Hellas Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into
by Wind Hellas, such as commercial agreements with some of its suppliers, and will entitle these third
parties to terminate their agreements with Wind Hellas or, in some cases, request adjustments of the
terms of the agreements. In addition, some of the third parties may use their termination or adjustment
rights to renegotiate the terms of the agreements to our detriment. We cannot exclude the possibility
that some of these third parties may exercise their termination, adjustment or other rights, which could
have a material adverse effect on our Wind Hellas’ business, results of operations and financial position
following completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties_**
**_provided in connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition and our ability to recover losses suffered as_**
**_a result of such a breach may be limited._**

In connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition, the Seller has given certain customary representations
and warranties and indemnities. Nonetheless, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of
the liabilities the Seller has agreed to retain, and we may not be able to enforce any claims against the
Seller relating to breaches of these representations and warranties. The liability of the Seller under these
agreements is very limited. Moreover, even if we are able to eventually recover any losses resulting
from a breach of these representations and warranties, we may temporarily be required to bear these
losses ourselves. In addition, if the Seller becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to
recover any losses suffered as a result of the Seller’s breach may be limited by the liquidity of the Seller
or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such breach, we could
incur losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

**_Wind Hellas may have liabilities that are not known to us or that are greater than anticipated, and_**
**_any indemnities under the Wind Hellas Acquisition Agreement or other agreements may be_**
**_insufficient._**

Wind Hellas and/or its subsidiaries may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the
course of performing due diligence investigations in connection with the Wind Hellas Acquisition. In
addition, the extent of liabilities we discovered in connection with our due diligence investigations or
after the Wind Hellas Acquisition may be greater than we expected. We may learn of additional
information about Wind Hellas and/or its subsidiaries that adversely affects us, such as unknown or
contingent liabilities, including existing or threatened legal proceedings, and issues relating to
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we could become liable for overdue
payables of Wind Hellas and/or its subsidiaries to suppliers and employees that are not currently known
to us, or we could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are
not currently aware of or the amount of which we underestimated, or we could become liable in relation
to past or pending disputes involving Wind Hellas and/or its subsidiaries that are not currently known
to us, or we could suffer losses relating to issues in title or required permits for the real estate property
owned and/or used by Wind Hellas and/or its subsidiaries that are not currently known to us. In
conducting our due diligence, we were required to rely on resources available to us, including public
information, information provided by the Seller and third-party consultants and advisers. There can be
no assurance that the due diligence we undertook has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary
or helpful in evaluating the Wind Hellas Acquisition. Any such unknown or previously underestimated
liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes.


-----

**_We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings from the Wind_**
**_Hellas Acquisition._**

Following the Wind Hellas Acquisition, we expect to realize certain operational efficiency and cost
saving measures, including cost savings expected to be generated from the integration of Wind Hellas
and Nova, and revenue expected to be generated from existing Wind Hellas’ contracts with the Greek
government relating to the connectivity procurement program SYZEFXIS II. We may not be able to
realize these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and
the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our ability to realize such
operational efficiency and cost savings measures may be affected by a number of factors, including
increases in expenses related to the Wind Hellas Acquisition. In addition, the Wind Hellas Acquisition
has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from management, which
could adversely affect their ability to operate our business. These factors may offset the expected cost
savings from the Wind Hellas Acquisition, or impair our ability to successfully integrate Wind Hellas
into our business.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent_**
**_us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees._**

We are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had €3,679 million of outstanding
indebtedness on a consolidated basis (excluding lease liabilities). On a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, including the use of proceeds from the Offering and the other transactions
described under “Capitalization,” as of September 30, 2021, we would have had €4,664 million of
outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. The terms of the Indentures permit (or, in the case as
of the SSN Indenture, will permit) the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial
additional indebtedness, including in respect of borrowings by the Company and its restricted
subsidiaries under any Credit Facility (as defined in the respective Indentures) of up to an amount
equivalent to the greater of €570 million and 100% of our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the
respective the Indentures) (which Credit Facility can rank in priority to the Senior Secured Notes in
respect of the recovery of any proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral). We also received
commitments for €325 million under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility 2021 Increase, which provided additional committed debt funding
for us to potentially draw in the future.

The degree to which we will continue to be leveraged following the issuance of the Senior Secured
Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Senior Secured Notes, including, but not
limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes and our other indebtedness and liabilities;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash
flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research
and development or other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;


-----

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they
are not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditure,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the
cost of any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Senior Secured Notes.

**_We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indentures (including the PIK Indenture, the 2017 Indenture, the 2019 Indenture, the 2020
Indenture and the SSN Indenture), the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and other debt agreements
may restrict our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- impair security interests that secure the Senior Secured Notes.

Our Existing Revolving Credit Facility in addition requires us to comply with a leverage ratio in certain
circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit
_Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet this test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we_
cannot assure you that we will satisfy this test. A breach of this test could result in a restriction on the
ability to make new drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of any
event of default under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility, subject to applicable cure periods and
other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of
the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments
that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indentures. If our creditors,
including the creditors under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those


-----

amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to
repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and
payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Senior Secured Notes, in full or in part. In
addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce against any collateral
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our_
ability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities
and activities that may be in our interests.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to_**
**_sustain our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, and to fund our ongoing
operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain
extent, is subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these
“Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that
currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing
will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the
Senior Secured Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The Existing 2024 SSNs will mature in 2024
and the Existing 2025 FRNs will mature in 2025, the Existing 2026 FRNs will mature in 2026, the
Existing 2027 SSNs will mature in 2027, and the Existing 3.625% 2028 SSNs and the Existing 4.625%
2028 SSNs will mature in 2028 prior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Existing PIK Notes issued by
Summer Bidco will mature in 2025. In addition, loans under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility may
be utilized until June 15, 2025 (which will be automatically reduced to (i) January 1, 2024, if the
Existing 2024 SSNs are not fully refinanced by such date or (ii) January 15, 2025, if the Existing 2025
FRNs are not fully refinanced by such date). The Fixed Rate SSNs offered hereby will mature in 2030
and the FRNs offered hereby will mature in 2029. At the respective maturity of the Senior Secured
Notes and any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and
other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or we are
otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required
to refinance our indebtedness. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our
cash needs and the conditions prevailing in the financial markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be
at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further
restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. If we are unable to refinance all or a
portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to
reduce or delay our business activities or capital expenditures or sell assets or raise additional debt or
equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. There can be no assurance that any assets that we
could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of
proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In
addition, the terms of our Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indentures, other debt
agreements and any future agreements may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

Any failure to make required cash payments on the Senior Secured Notes on a timely basis would likely
result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness.


-----

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the_**
**_future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes,_**
**_and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be
structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior
to the Senior Secured Notes. In addition to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
obligations, we may incur additional indebtedness that is permitted to share in proceeds from
enforcement of the Collateral on a super priority basis. Although the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Indentures contain, or will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, and under
certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels,
the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
and the Indentures do not, or, as applicable, will not, prevent us from incurring obligations or entering
other arrangements that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, such as qualified
receivables securitization financings.

**_The FRNs will bear, and the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the loans under the Existing_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility Agreement bear, interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The FRNs will bear, and the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the loans under our Existing Revolving
Credit Facility bear, interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to LIBOR or EURIBOR (as
the case may be), as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. Although we may enter into and maintain
certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that
hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain
risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging
arrangements. These interest rates could also rise significantly in the future. To the extent interest rates
were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the FRNs, the Existing Floating Rate
Notes and debt under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement would correspondingly
increase, thus reducing our cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR and various government investigations, on September
4, 2019, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that use of the LIBOR benchmark is expected
to cease after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that LIBOR is
expected to be replaced in the United States by Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and in the
UK by Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA). The expected elimination of the LIBOR
benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law
enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is
determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark, including but not limited to the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR, or the FRNs and
the Existing Floating Rate Notes. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation
thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could
have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_Our hedging and other derivative arrangements may not effectively or sufficiently offset the negative_**
**_impact of interest rate and currency fluctuations._**

We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against
certain interest rate risks. We have made use of hedging arrangements to protect our business against
interest rate fluctuations on our local credit facilities and exchange rate fluctuations, and we may
continue to make use of hedging and other derivative arrangements going forward. Although we may
enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of our floating interest


-----

rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount
(including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or
may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from foreign currency
variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may negatively impact operating
results.

**Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_Our subsidiaries located in Serbia, as well as other subsidiaries representing a significant portion of_**
**_our revenue and EBITDA, will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, and each of the SSN_**
**_Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our_**
**_non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of
preferred or minority shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims under
any intercompany loans and claims by holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the SSN Guarantees.
In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or
other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their
indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the
assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to such subsidiary’s
parent entity. As such, the Senior Secured Notes and each SSN Guarantee will each be structurally
subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our nonguarantor subsidiaries for the Senior Secured Notes. For the nine months ended as of September 30,
2021, (i) the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding the Target Group) generated 44% of the Company’s
consolidated revenue and 59% of the Company’s consolidated UG EBITDA, (ii) the Company’s
subsidiaries (including the Issuer and the Guarantors, but excluding the Target Group) had a profit for
the period of €34 million, compared to a consolidated net loss of €62 million for the Company and (iii)
the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding the Target Group) represented 43% of the Company’s
consolidated total assets (excluding goodwill). The Company’s subsidiaries organized in Serbia, North
Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Malta, Cyprus, Switzerland and Canada, and some of the Company’s
subsidiaries organized in Slovenia, Bulgaria and Greece are not required to guarantee the obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Each SSN Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_**
**_may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Senior Secured Notes on a senior basis. Each SSN
Guarantee will provide the holders of the Senior Secured Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. However, the SSN Indenture will include language to the effect that each SSN Guarantee
and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation under Security Document will be
limited so as to ensure compliance with local law. The SSN Guarantees, security interests and other
obligations will also be subject to applicable corporate and other laws and defenses, including foreign
exchange laws. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance,
financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws and
regulations. In general, these laws prohibit companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for
the purpose of acquiring their shares and limit the circumstances in which companies can transfer
economic benefits to their shareholders outside the payment of properly declared dividends. They also
provide for limitations that affect the rights of creditors generally in case an entity becomes insolvent.
See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security Interests” for
more details regarding limitations on the SSN Guarantees and Security Interests in the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Greece.


-----

While similar laws apply in many jurisdictions, because several of the Guarantors and the substantial
majority of the assets in which security interests are granted are located in CEE countries which have
relatively young capital markets and where courts have limited experience with transactions of the type
envisaged by the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, there is considerable uncertainty as to how the
relevant laws will be applied and ultimately to what extent the SSN Guarantees and other security
interests granted under the SSN Indenture will be enforceable. For example, while the Slovenian law
prohibiting companies from providing financial assistance to a third-party for the purpose of acquiring
its shares applies only to joint stock companies, there is a significant risk that a court might extend this
provision to the acquisition of shares of a joint stock company’s direct or indirect parents or to limited
liability companies. Moreover, the Bosnian legislature adopted rules prohibiting limited liability
companies from providing financial assistance to anyone for the purpose of acquiring their shares,
thereby bringing the applicable legal regime in line with the rules applicable to joint stock companies.
For those reasons, the risk of limitations on enforcement is greater in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Montenegro than in European countries with more established legal systems and a
long history of secured bond offerings.

The Bulgarian limitations on the SSN Guarantees granted by United Group Bulgaria, Viva Telecom
and BTC and the Vivacom Collateral, including any thin capitalization and financial assistance issues
that might limit the extent of guarantees and security by United Group Bulgaria, Viva Telecom and
BTC are set out in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security
_Interests.”_

The Greek limitations on the SSN Guarantee to be granted by Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A.,
including any thin capitalization and financial assistance issues that might limit the extent of the
guarantee by Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. are set out in “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Moreover, certain transaction documents are governed by U.S. law. Judgments rendered by a U.S. court
will generally not be directly enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which the majority of the assets
by which the bonds are secured are located. Instead, in many of these jurisdictions, as a pre-condition
to enforcing a U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of
the factors the court will consider involve a considerable amount of discretion. Even if the court
ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the process may take a lengthy amount of time to
complete. For all of these reasons, an investment in the Senior Secured Notes involves unique risks that
may not apply or apply differently in a more conventional secured bond offering. If any of these risks
materializes, your ability to collect payments of principal and interest under the Senior Secured Notes
may be materially adversely affected. See “Enforceability of Judgments” for more information.

**_Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and depends on_**
**_distributions from its subsidiaries to service and repay the Senior Secured Notes; certain covenants_**
**_in our financing arrangements and other agreements may limit the availability of operating cash_**
**_flow to the Issuer._**

Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and conducts its operations
principally through, and derives its revenues principally from, its subsidiaries. The ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to the Issuer will be subject to the
availability of profits or funds for such purpose which, in turn, will depend on the future performance
of the subsidiary concerned which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond its control. In addition, certain
of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the making of such distributions contained in their other
financing arrangements, and such financing arrangements may actually prohibit the ability of these
subsidiaries to move cash within the restricted group. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.” Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries are permitted_
to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The Issuer’s
subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) will have no obligation to make payments with respect to the


-----

Senior Secured Notes. Applicable tax laws and regulations may also subject such payments to further
taxation. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient profits or cash flow
from operations or that alternative sources of financing will be available at any time in an amount
sufficient to enable these subsidiaries to service their indebtedness and to fund their other liquidity needs
and also make payments to the Issuer sufficient to allow all cash payment obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes to be met.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has_**
**_been granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured indebtedness may be_**
**_secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes; in the event that the Collateral_**
**_is enforced, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties of certain_**
**_hedging obligations and creditors for other super priority indebtedness will be paid with the proceeds_**
**_from the enforcement of Collateral in priority to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the Collateral no later than at the times described herein,
and initially the Senior Secured Notes will not be secured by all the Collateral. If an event of default
occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes
will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral underlying their security interest at such
time. The Issuer, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the
future, which may also be secured by the relevant Collateral. If the value of the Collateral is less than
the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes together with the claims of the other
secured creditors, those claims may not be satisfied in full. The Existing Notes and the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility are secured, and the Senior Secured Notes will be secured, with certain assets
of the Company and the Company’s restricted subsidiaries. The SSN Indenture will allow the Company
and its restricted subsidiaries to secure additional indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the SSN
Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes) with the property and assets
of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The amount
of indebtedness and the value of such assets and property could be significant.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the offering
of the Senior Secured Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on
factors that include, among others, our ability to implement our business strategy, the ability to sell the
Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers, whether or not the
business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale and similar factors.
The amount to be received upon a sale of any Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors,
including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, general, market
and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of the sale. There also can be no assurance that
the Collateral will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of any liquidation or foreclosure is
uncertain and there could be substantial delays. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we
operate include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and
consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our
business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold
such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the security
documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain
jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be
challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all.
As a result, enforcement may be delayed, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property
owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability of the relevant
Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the security. By the nature of our business, some or all of the
Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event that a
bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of
principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Secured Notes and other obligations secured by


-----

the same Collateral, interest may cease to accrue on such Senior Secured Notes from and after the date
the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will
be sufficient to pay the obligations due under such Senior Secured Notes.

With respect to any shares pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes, including the shares of the Issuer
and certain Guarantors, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the
obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no
remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of
these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the
value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the relevant Collateral are not sufficient
to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of such Senior Secured Notes (to the
extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) generally would have only a senior
unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the remaining assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The SSN Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes on the relevant Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured
indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the SSN
Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the SSN
Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on
the Collateral.

The security interests in the Collateral and any additional security interests granted in the future are
subject to certain agreed security principles applicable to such Collateral and the Intercreditor
Agreement. These agreed security principles set forth limitations on the requirement to grant security
interests in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances and may result in recoveries
from security interests being limited or security not being granted at all over particular types or classes
of assets.

Furthermore, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral
will be applied to repay claims of the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and creditors
of other priority indebtedness in priority to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and other secured
obligations. Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may therefore receive less from the proceeds of the
Collateral in an enforcement or insolvency scenario than if they were not required to share the proceeds.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Senior Secured Notes will generally be secured by the same Collateral securing the obligations
under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations and the 2017 Indenture,
the 2019 Indenture and the 2020 Indenture. We can incur significant additional indebtedness and other
obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral under the terms of the SSN Indenture.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the agent of the creditor class who wishes to deliver an
enforcement instruction must first consult with every agent or representative of the other creditor
classes, certain creditors and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 30 days. After an initial
consultation period, the Security Agent may act upon the instructions of an instructing group, which
may be holders of 66⅔% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding or
creditors of 66⅔% of the aggregate principal amount of super senior indebtedness (which includes
drawn and undrawn commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility). To the extent there are
conflicting instructions, those on behalf of holders of the Senior Secured Notes will prevail. However,
in certain circumstances the creditors under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and any future


-----

counterparties to certain hedging arrangements and other indebtedness secured by the Collateral in
priority to the Senior Secured Notes will have control over enforcement of the Collateral, including if
(i) such creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the first 30 day consultation
period, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three-months of the
end of the first 30 day consultation period or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred and the Security
Agent has not commenced any enforcement action.

These arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Collateral in a manner that results in lower
recoveries by holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement could have interests that differ from the interests of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes and may elect to commence enforcement action against the Company or its subsidiaries
at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In
addition, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable
bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired, reduced or eliminated
in value due to delays in enforcement.

If the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of the Company’s subsidiaries as a
result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior
Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the Senior Secured
Notes and the SSN Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—_
_Release of Liens.”_

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which_**
**_the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees will be released_**
**_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes
will be released automatically. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—SSN Guarantees” and
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security
Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result
of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims under the Senior
Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees may be released or transferred. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—_
_Security—Release of Liens.” Your ability to recover on the Senior Secured Notes could be materially_
impaired in such circumstances.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral; the operation of the_**
**_business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from certain of the
Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the SSN Indenture would result therefrom,
the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, subject to the terms of the security documents,
without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to the Collateral such as selling, modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing
of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.
Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable
to you from the proceeds of any sale of such Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the
Senior Secured Notes.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the delay in or failure to grant or perfect_**
**_security interests in the Collateral._**


-----

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as
applicable. The liens on the relevant Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be perfected
with respect to the claims of the Senior Secured Notes if we or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to
take the actions required to perfect any of these liens or if it has been agreed that such perfection steps
shall not be taken on the basis that such steps have undesirable effects. Furthermore, applicable law
requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as
real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or
promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have limited obligations to assist the Security Agent in perfecting the
security interest of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in specified Collateral. There can be no
assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that the Issuer will inform the Security Agent of, the
future acquisition of property and rights that should constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action
will be taken to properly create and perfect the security interest in such property and rights acquired
after the Issue Date. The Security Agent has no obligation or responsibility to perfect the security
interests in Collateral or to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute
Collateral or the creation or perfection of any security interest. The failure to create or perfect such
additional security interests may adversely affect the relevant security interest and/or the priority of
such security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The granting of security interests in the Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes may create hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law_**
**_applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The release of existing security interests in the Collateral which secure the Existing Notes, and the
granting of new security interests in such Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Senior
Secured Notes offered hereby or additional notes in the future may create direct or indirect hardening
or voidance periods as applicable for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable
hardening or voidance period for these new security interests may run from the moment such security
interests are extended and perfected with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or, if later, the issuance
of such Senior Secured Notes. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected, extended or
recreated were to be enforced before the end of the applicable hardening or voidance period, it may be
declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of shared security
interests to secure existing and new indebtedness or future indebtedness, as the case may be, may restart
or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions in particular because the SSN Indenture will permit
the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances
including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. If the grantor of such security interests were
to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or
security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security
interests in place as of the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver,
liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under
insolvency law. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security
_Interests.”_

**_Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain SSN Guarantees and Collateral may be released, and any retaken_**
**_Collateral may be subject to hardening periods._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown.” Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown (as defined in_
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes”), references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and
all related provisions) in the SSN Indenture shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although
the Issuer shall remain the same entity. Upon such substitution, each Holding Company (as defined in
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes”) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably and


-----

unconditionally released from all obligations under the SSN Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
and any SSN Guarantees or security granted by such Holding Company in respect of the SSN Indenture
and the Senior Secured Notes will be released. In such a case, new security documents in respect of the
Collateral to be retaken and that will remain in place following an IPO Pushdown, including the pledge
of the shares of the Issuer, may need to be executed and be subject to new hardening periods.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections permitted under the SSN Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence
of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the
value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent
to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected
by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements,
statutory liens or re characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. There can be no assurance
that the assets comprising the Collateral are, or will be, free and clear from third-party prior ranking
security rights or other interests, such as security interests arising under standard contract terms or by
operation of law. Any such rights or interests would adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the
ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose such Collateral.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in Collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the
consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that
the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents
of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly,
the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral
may decline significantly.

**_Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Accordingly,
the rights under the Collateral will be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be
difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar
proceedings. Moreover, such multi- jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for
creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.
The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which
jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to
realize any recovery under the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees. See also “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_you. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local_**
**_law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior
Secured Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the SSN Guarantees will not be granted
directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security
Agent. The SSN Indenture will provide, and the Intercreditor Agreement provides, that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect
of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to
the provisions of the New Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.


-----

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject
to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral
are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain
pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There
is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners
of the Senior Secured Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be
validly secured and/or can be enforced. This area of law is untested in the courts of certain of the relevant
jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of security interests (and in particular, the requirements of accessority where the validity,
extent and enforceability of security is linked to (i.e., is accessory to) the secured claim) and the
enforceability of such security interests, the security agent and/or trustee is not able to hold the benefit
of security on behalf of a group of creditors.

Under Dutch law, and laws of certain other jurisdictions (including Slovenia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina), it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (“Parallel Debt”) obligations in favor
of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors towards the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Principal
Obligations”). The Dutch law security interests are granted to the Security Agent as security for the
Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. As a result, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent. In relation to the security interests located in other jurisdictions, the Security Agent might be
appointed as joint and several creditor of secured obligations, including the Parallel Debt claim. The
parallel debt construct has not been tested under laws of certain of the Guarantors’ jurisdictions,
including (without limitation) Dutch law and Slovenian law and, to the extent that the security interests
in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders
of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to demand performance as holders of the secured claim
and will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the relevant
Collateral.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of the Netherlands and the respective jurisdictions of_**
**_incorporation of the Guarantors or future guarantors of the Senior Secured Notes may not be as_**
**_favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws or the laws of another jurisdiction with which you are_**
**_familiar and may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes from recovering payments due on_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and the Guarantors are incorporated under
the laws of various jurisdictions, including the laws of the Netherlands, Slovenia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Greece. In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future
guarantors, any future guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. SSN Guarantees and Collateral provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not
discussed in this offering memorandum are also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms,
by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the SSN Guarantees or the security for the Senior Secured
Notes after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the
insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The
insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void
preferential transfers, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition
interest and duration of the proceedings and preference periods. The application of these laws, or any
conflict among them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular
jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the SSN


-----

Guarantees, any future guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or the Collateral in these jurisdictions
and limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the SSN Guarantees and the security that secures the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by, and secured by certain assets of,
the Guarantors or their shares. The Guarantors are organized or incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Greece. Although laws
differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws,
equitable principles and insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the SSN Guarantee and the
security against a Guarantor or Collateral provider. Courts may also in certain circumstances avoid the
security interest or the SSN Guarantee where the Collateral provider is close to, or in the vicinity of,
insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although
an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant
jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Enforceability of Judgments” for_
more information.

In insolvency proceedings, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors, the Collateral providers or the
appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the SSN Guarantees and security, and intercompany
obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers
or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings,
to:

- void or invalidate all or a portion of an Guarantor’s obligations under its guarantee or the
security interests provided by the Issuer or such Guarantor;

- direct that the Issuer and/or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes return any amounts paid
under a guarantee or any security document to the relevant Guarantor or to the respective
Collateral provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or the Collateral
provider; and

- take other action that is detrimental to holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any SSN Guarantee or security
interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charge, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure the holders of the Senior Secured Notes that we
can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the liability
of each Guarantor under its guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes and the liability of each Collateral
provider will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interest not
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.
The amount recoverable from a Guarantor or a Collateral provider under the security documents will
also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what methodology a court would apply in
making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or each Collateral provider and
whether a court would give effect to such attempted limitation. Also, there is a possibility that the entire
guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case, the Guarantor’s or Collateral provider’s
entire liability may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would likely, for example, need to find that, at the time the security interests were created, the Collateral
provider:


-----

- issued such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or
future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security
after its insolvency;

- created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of
such Collateral provider would have contributed equity to such Collateral provider or where
the relevant beneficiary of the security interest knew or should have known that the Collateral
provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the security
interest on the basis that the security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly
the Collateral provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered
insolvent by reason of the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent
for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which
the Collateral provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed
it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would
become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or Collateral provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a guarantee or
created any security if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due (and it is unable to get further credit); or

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a
Collateral provider was “insolvent” as of the date the SSN Guarantees were issued or security was
created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that the Issuer, a
Collateral provider or a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine,
regardless of whether or not a Guarantor, the Issuer or a Collateral provider was insolvent on the date
the respective guarantee was issued or security interest was created, that payments to holders of the
Senior Secured Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the SSN
Guarantees and the security interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the SSN
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes._**

BC Partners, along with certain co-investors, indirectly owns an approximate 56% stake in the Issuer.
Our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and
capital structure, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes
to our operations and to control the outcome of matters requiring action by shareholders. The interests
of our shareholders may conflict with the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes, particularly
if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Investment funds advised
by BC Partners are in the business of making investments in companies and may have an interest in
pursuing acquisitions, divestiture (including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or
sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure), dividend distributions,
financing or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even
though such transactions might involve risks to you as holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition,


-----

our shareholders may pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as
a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Conversely, our shareholders may
have an interest in not pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that could enhance our
cash flow and be beneficial to you. Moreover, investment funds advised by BC Partners may, from time
to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly, or indirectly, with us. See
“Principal Shareholders.”

**_The interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the interests of holders of a series of_**
**_additional notes under the SSN Indenture may be inconsistent._**

The Senior Secured Notes and any other additional notes issued under the SSN Indenture will be issued
pursuant to a single SSN Indenture and will vote as a single class with respect to amendments, waivers
or other modifications of the SSN Indenture other than with respect to amendments, waivers or other
modifications that will only affect the Senior Secured Notes or such additional notes. Subject to certain
restrictions, further series of additional notes may be issued under the SSN Indenture, which have
different terms in respect of currency, interest rate and certain other matters. Such additional notes will
also generally vote as a single class with other series of notes issued under the SSN Indenture but may
have interests that differ from the interests of holders of other series of notes issued under the SSN
Indenture, including the Senior Secured Notes. The Fixed Rate SSNs and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes
bear interest at a fixed rate, and the New FRNs and the Existing Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a
floating rate, and such notes have, or will have, among other things, different interest rates, different
maturities, call schedules and call protection from each other and other features that may differ from
additional notes issued under the SSN Indenture in the future. As a result of these differences, the
interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the interests of holders of additional notes could
conflict. In addition, the holders of Senior Secured Notes may be in a position to agree to certain terms
in a consent solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Senior Secured Notes but adverse to
the economic interest of the other series of notes issued under the SSN Indenture; however, to the extent
the relevant amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding under the SSN Indenture (subject to the limited
exceptions), all holders of Notes under the SSN Indenture will be bound by such amendment.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and all of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United
States. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of
the United States and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although
the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection
with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the
United States on our directors and executive officers located outside the United States. In addition, as
the assets of the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their
directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S.
Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i)
judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer and the Issuer’s managing directors who
are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States
federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against
us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with
The Netherlands. For further information see “Enforceability of Judgments.”

**_Investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have limited recourse against our independent auditors._**

Investors in the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby should understand that statements may be made
by the independent auditors whose reports are included in this offering memorandum which may be
intended to disclaim any liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes) other than
to the Company with respect to reports relating to the financial statements of the Company. The SEC
would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used
in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under
the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such language, the recourse
that investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their
reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to
which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many
jurisdictions, and the legal effect of these statements in their reports may be untested in the context of
an offering of securities. The inclusion of such language, however, may limit the ability of holders of
the Senior Secured Notes to bring any action against our auditors for damages arising out of an
investment in the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The transfer of the Senior Secured Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity_**
**_and the price at which they may be sold._**

Because the Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be, registered
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold
in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable laws. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Senior Secured
Notes. It is the obligation of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of
the Senior Secured Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on_**
**_the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through
Euroclear and Clearstream and will trade in book-entry form.

Unless and until definitive Senior Secured Notes (each a “Definitive Registered Note”) are issued in
exchange for book- entry interests in the Global Notes (which will only occur in very limited
circumstances), owners of the book- entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Senior
Secured Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Senior Secured Notes. Payments
of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes will be made to the
Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments
will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes. After
payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Paying Agent
will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the
owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder under the SSN Indenture. See “Book-entry; Delivery and Form.”

Unlike registered holders of the Senior Secured Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will
not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions
from registered holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will
be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or
Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented


-----

for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a
timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the SSN Indenture, unless and until
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that
the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the
timely exercise of rights under the Senior Secured Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in which case your ability_**
**_to sell the Senior Secured Notes may be limited._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be new securities for which there will be no established trading market.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Senior Secured Notes;

- your ability to sell your Senior Secured Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Senior Secured Notes.

Future trading prices for the Senior Secured Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other
things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically,
the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Senior Secured Notes. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Senior Secured Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the
market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading
market for the Senior Secured Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to
which the Senior Secured Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Senior Secured Notes
will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the
Senior Secured Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no
assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. If no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Senior Secured Notes at a fair value,
if at all.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes
after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market
making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to
limitations imposed by the Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there
may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your Senior Secured Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Senior Secured Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Senior
Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes
will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission
to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such
listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange.
Listing of any of the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange does not imply that a
public offering of any of the Senior Secured Notes in Guernsey has been authorized. Although no
assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes as a result of the listing on the Official
List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another
stock exchange) of the Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may


-----

have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, in the
secondary market.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Senior Secured Notes
and/or the Senior Secured Notes (or make a public statement about an existing credit rating). The credit
ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes and
credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Senior Secured
Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Senior Secured
Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a
credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered
or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so
warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Senior
Secured Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and
conditions of our financing and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Senior Secured
Notes.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control as required by the SSN Indenture and the_**
**_change of control provision contained in the SSN Indenture may not necessarily afford you_**
**_protection in the event of certain important corporate events. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a_**
**_tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” under the SSN Indenture, the
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but
not including) the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that
we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide
to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual
obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an
event of default under, or require the repayment of or result in an acceleration of, our Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does
not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then
existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from
providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Senior Secured Notes, we may seek
the consent of the holders or lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Senior Secured
Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to
repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes.
In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control, and we cannot assure you that we
would be able to obtain such financing or that such financing would be on acceptable terms.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to repurchase any of the Senior Secured Notes if so required would
constitute a default under the SSN Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the PIK Indenture, the 2017 Indenture, the 2019 Indenture, the


-----

2020 Indenture and the agreements governing certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Change of Control.”_

The change of control provisions contained in the SSN Indenture may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring,
merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because
such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they
do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the New Indenture. Except as described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control,” the SSN Indenture will not contain
provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in
the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under
the SSN Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if the consolidated leverage ratio is less
than a certain specified level. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions—
_Specified Change of Control Event.”_

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Senior Secured Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer
in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the relevant Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
other holders of Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain_**
**_that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**

The definition of “Change of Control” in the SSN Indenture will included (with certain exceptions) a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law, varies
according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial
interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the
Company and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their
investment returns by reference to a currency other than euros, an investment in the Senior Secured
Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes
in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on
their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on
their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Senior Secured Notes below their
stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Senior Secured Notes
is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their
investments. Investments in the Senior Secured Notes, which are denominated in a currency other than
U.S. dollars, by U.S. Holders (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations—General”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange_
gains or losses, if any. See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”


-----

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO_**
**_Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown”). Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown references to_
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the SSN Indenture shall
apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the
Issuer shall remain the same entity. In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
would be released from its obligations under the SSN Indenture. Such a modification to the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange
of (i) the Senior Secured Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) modified Senior Secured
Notes as in place after such modifications (“Modified Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a
deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes could be required
to recognize gain or loss.

Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Modified Notes deemed issued in such a deemed
exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”). In such event, U.S. Holders
(as defined under “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—General”)
would be required to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the
receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to
the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Senior Secured Notes in
connection with the IPO Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed
exchange and resulting OID, if any.

and the amount of cash used to make the loan referred to under “Related Party Transactions—Transactions Involving
_Our Founder and Chairman of the Advisory Board.”_

(2) Represents €580 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate SSNs and €400 million in aggregate principal

###### UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

_We present in this offering memorandum certain unaudited pro forma financial information (the_
_“Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”), which includes:_

_(iii)_ _the unaudited pro forma balance sheet of the Company as of September 30, 2021 (the_
_“Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet”); and_

_(iv)_ _the unaudited pro forma income statements of the Company for the year ended December 31,_
_2020, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 and the last two_
_quarters ended September 30, 2021 (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements”)._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on and derived from, and should be read in_
_conjunction with, the Company Audited Financial Statements, the Company Unaudited Interim_
_Financial Statements, the Wind Hellas Audited Financial Statements, the Wind Hellas Unaudited_
_Interim Financial Statements and the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, included_
_elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet presents the Company’s financial position on a pro forma_
_basis as if the Transactions, as further described under “Summary—The Transactions,” “Use of_
_Proceeds” and in the footnotes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, had occurred as of_
_September 30, 2021. The Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements give effect to: (i) the Transactions,_
_as further described under “Summary—The Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds” and in the footnotes to_
_the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information as if they had been completed on the first day of the_
_relevant period described in such Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement (the first day of each such_
_relevant period being January 1, 2020, January 1, 2021 and April 1, 2021); and (ii) the Vivacom_
_Acquisition and the Vivacom Transactions as if they had been completed on January 1, 2020, as_
_reflected in the relevant Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based on available information and certain_
_assumptions that we believe are reasonable and factually supportable. The assumptions and estimates_
_underlying the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information are described in the accompanying notes_
_thereto. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes only_
_and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the financial condition or results of operations that_
_we would have reported had the Transactions, the Vivacom Acquisition and the Vivacom Transactions_
_actually occurred during the periods and as of the dates presented, and the Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Financial Information does not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition as of_
_any future date or for any future period. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments_
_nor the resulting Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information have been audited or reviewed in_
_accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards._

_The Group is not subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC. Accordingly, the Unaudited Pro_
_Forma Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation_
_S-X of the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting_
_standards. For more information, please refer to “Presentation of Financial Data” and “Unaudited_
_Pro Forma Financial Information.”_

_The Wind Hellas Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in_
_accordance with IFRS, and specifically in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations,” which_
_sets out the obligation for the acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities_
_assumed at their acquisition date fair values. As a result, for the purposes of preparing the consolidated_
_financial statements of the Company in the future, the total purchase price will be allocated to the_
_tangible, intangible and other assets acquired, as well as the liabilities and contingent liabilities_
_assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, with any_
_excess of the cost of the Wind Hellas Acquisition over the fair value of the Company’s share of the net_


-----

_identifiable assets acquired allocated to goodwill. No such purchase price allocation was performed as_
_of the date of this offering memorandum, and therefore, except where indicated, no fair value_
_adjustments have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax_
_effects) in respect of the Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet. Similarly, the Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Income Statements do not include any adjustments with respect to additional depreciation or_
_amortization that would be charged as a result of the recognition of new depreciable assets or charges_
_or credits as a result of the change in value of any existing assets or liabilities._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is presented in millions of euros unless otherwise_
_indicated. Vivacom’s historical financial information is presented in millions of Bulgarian Lev. For the_
_purposes of the relevant Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, financial information reported_
_in Bulgarian lev has been translated to euros on the basis stated in relevant footnotes to the Unaudited_
_Pro Forma Financial Information._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information includes unaudited pro forma adjustments that are_
_factually supportable and directly attributable to the Transactions, the Vivacom Acquisition and the_
_Vivacom Transactions._

_In addition to the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the Vivacom Acquisition, the Company also: (i) acquired_

(a) Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information has been extracted from the Wind Hellas Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements without material adjustments. Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information is
prepared in euros.


-----

(b) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Crystal Almond Midco’s line items to conform
to the Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to align Crystal Almond Midco’s accounting policies with the
Company’s accounting policies. Under its currently applied accounting policies, Crystal Almond Midco
capitalizes contract cost related to (i) commissions paid to dealers and franchisees categorized as
subscribers acquisition cost and (ii) fixed customer activation costs as contract costs and expenses related
cost amortized in the income statement as “purchase, services and other expenses”, while in accordance
with the Company’s accounting policies such costs are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized on
profit and loss, by the Company.

(3) Reflects proceeds from the Offering, repayment of certain financing and certain other fees relating to the
Transactions as follows:

**(in € million)**

**Senior Secured Notes offered hereby**

Gross proceeds from Fixed Rate SSNs ...................... 580.0

Gross proceeds from FRNs ................................... 400.0

Estimated transaction cost related to the Offering ......... (14.5)

**Borrowing under the Existing Revolving Credit**
**Facility ........................................................** **5.0**


**Repayment of Wind Hellas Existing Notes**

Redemption fees[(b)] .............................................. (11.2)

**Other fees payable**

Acquisitions cost related to CAIHL[(b)] ....................... (2.0)

Bridge loan fees payment[(b)] ................................... (10.8)

**Net increase on cash and cash equivalents ...............** **411.2**

###### _________________________

(a) Represents unamortized transaction costs included in determination of amortized cost in financial
statements of Crystal Almond Midco. The adjustment represents the increase of carrying value of bonds
to the fair value and hence ultimately adjust the goodwill arising on acquisition.

(b) Amounts relating to early repayment of the Wind Hellas Existing Notes as well as certain other fees
payable will be charged to income statement when the Transaction occurs. As these represent nonrecurring adjustments, their future element is not reflected in pro forma income statement.

(4) The adjustment represents effects of payment for the Wind Hellas Acquisition and related allocation of purchase
price as well as the recognition of certain assets and liabilities arising as the result of the Transactions.

As per the Wind Hellas Acquisition Agreement, in connection with the completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition
the Seller will pay an amount equal to the Seller’s intercompany loan amount out of the consideration payable to
Wind Hellas Parent in satisfaction and full settlement of all amounts due including principal and accrued but unpaid
interest. As at September 30, 2021, the principal amounted to €7.7 million and accrued interest amounted to €2.3
million and these amounts ultimately adjust the goodwill arising upon the acquisition.

(a) Under the terms of the agreement with the Seller, the total consideration payable for the Wind Hellas
Acquisition amounts to €545.0 million, but such amount will be reduced by any amounts paid by Crystal
Almond Midco until completion of the Wind Hellas Acquisition and considered by the parties as leakage.
As of the date of this offering memorandum, the amount of such leakage was estimated by management
at €8.7 million. In addition, pursuant to the Wind Hellas Acquisition Agreement, upon payment of the
consideration for the Wind Hellas Acquisition, the Seller will settle its outstanding liability to Wind Hellas
Parent amounting to €10.0 million. The overall impact of these transactions on pro-forma cash balance is
as follows:


-----

**(in € million)**

Purchase price before adjustments ..................................... 545.0

Known leakage ........................................................... (8.7)

_Plus: Seller intercompany loan amount ..............................._ 10.0

Purchase price (net of leakage) ......................................... 546.3

Repayment of Seller’s indebtedness to Wind Hellas Parent ...... (10.0)

Net disclosed Seller transaction costs ................................. 7.0

**Net cash outflow ........................................................** **543.3**

(b) The Wind Hellas Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in
accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations,” which sets out the obligation for the acquirer to
measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. No
such purchase price allocation was performed as of the date of this offering memorandum and therefore
no fair value adjustments have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated
deferred tax effects), except as discussed above. The excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the carrying
value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of Crystal Almond Midco as at September 30,
2021, resulted in an indicative adjustment to Goodwill of €463.9 million included in the Unaudited Pro
Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is a preliminary goodwill value which is likely to change, as the
result of identification and measurement of assets and liabilities at their fair value and changes in assets
and liabilities of Crystal Almond Midco between September 30, 2021 and the Wind Hellas Acquisition
Closing Date.

(5) The adjustment represents adjustments made to eliminate intercompany balances between Crystal Almond Midco
and the Group’s subsidiaries.

(a) Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information was derived from the Wind Hellas Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements without material adjustments. Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information is

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to align Crystal Almond Midco’s accounting policies with the

capitalizes contract cost related to (i) commissions paid to dealers and franchisees categorized as

related cost amortized in the income statement as “purchase, services and other expenses”, while in
accordance with the Company’s accounting policies such costs are capitalized as intangible assets and
amortized on profit and loss by the Company.

(3) An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions between Crystal Almond Midco and the other
members of the Target Group.

(4) Represent adjustment relating to refinancing calculated as follows:


-----

**Nine months ended**

**September 30, 2021**

**(in € million)**

**Additional costs**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes and related amortized cost ............. (34.3)

**Reduction in costs**

Reversal of interest and amortized cost on Wind Hellas Existing Notes .... 17.6

Reversal of interest and amortized cost on Wind Hellas Revolving Credit
Facility ................................................................................ 0.6

**Incremental interest (expense) / reduction ...................................** **(16.1)**

Tax impact of incremental interest expense ..................................... 4.0

**Financing adjustments ............................................................** **(12.1)**

Interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes was calculated using the following rates: % for Fixed Rate SSNs
and % +Euribor for the FRNs. Estimated interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes includes amortization
of debt issuance cost. No adjustment has been made for non-recurring future transaction costs relating to repayment
of existing financing and arranging additional intermediary and liquidity supporting financing. These expenses will
be incurred upon completion of the Transactions (transaction costs related to the Offering, redemption fees, costs
related to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, and fees related to the prepayment of the Bridge Facilities). See also Note 3
to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021.”

Interest charge on the borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility is not included in the adjustment.
The estimated amount of this charge is approximately €0.2 million per annum.

(5) As discussed in Note 4 to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet,” no purchase price allocation related to Crystal
Almond Midco was performed as of the date of this offering memorandum and therefore no fair value adjustments
have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), except as discussed
elsewhere and the entire difference between total consideration paid for the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the
historical book value of Crystal Almond Midco was assumed as goodwill. The Company expects to identify and
measure significant identifiable assets such as: customer base, licenses, trademark and technology related intangible
assets. Recognition of new depreciable assets or increase of value of existing intangible assets and items of property,
plant and equipment will cause additional amortization and depreciation charges. The amount of charge will depend
on value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of such assets. The estimation of the impact of
additional charges cannot be made as of the date of this offering memorandum. The additional depreciation and
amortization will reduce consolidated net income and retained earnings of the Group, and such reduction of net
income will be compensated by reduction of deferred tax liability deriving from differences between carrying value
of assets (after fair value adjustments) and tax values of assets. The additional depreciation and amortization and
related tax effect will not have any impact on our Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDAaL.

(6) Pro forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, assets
held for sale and overflow between periods. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases represents Pro
Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure as further adjusted to exclude the impact on right-of-use assets additions and,
starting from 2021, the right-of-use asset modifications and prepayments. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases are prepared based on management accounts and not
IFRS. A reconciliation of capital expenditure as calculated under IFRS to Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases is as follows:

(7) Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are supplemental measures
of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are not a measurement of performance or liquidity
under IFRS and you should not consider Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDAaL as an alternative to (a) net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of our operating
performance), (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any other measure
of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL and the ratios derived therefrom, because we believe that they are measures commonly
used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing our business. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma

_________________________

(a) Vivacom’s financial information has been derived from Note 30 to the Vivacom Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements. Financial information for the seven months ended July 31, 2020 is derived by taking
the financial data for nine months ended September 30, 2020 and subtracting the financial information for
the two months ended September 30, 2020 (which financial information has not been reviewed or audited).
The financial information is prepared in Bulgarian levs (BGN).

(b) Amounts were converted using the BGN/euro exchange rate of BGN 1.95583 to €1.00, the pegged rate for
the period.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Vivacom’s line items to conform to the
Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(d) The purpose of the adjustment is to illustrate the effects of:

(i) _Eliminating the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD_

The Group acquired Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (formerly, Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD) in
the Vivacom Acquisition. Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD is a holding company of the Vivacom
Group but does not itself prepare consolidated financial information. The pro forma financial
information of Vivacom included herein is based on the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements and therefore certain adjustments are made to eliminate the effect of transactions
between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD. An adjustment was made to eliminate
intercompany transactions, comprising an interest income amounting to €6.3 million and
reversal of impairment cost amounting to €0.3 million and related tax effects of €0.7 million.


-----

(ii) _Purchase price allocation_

The purchase price allocation was finalized as of December 31, 2020 and therefore the Company
Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the fair value
adjustments that have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated
deferred tax effects) and differences between total consideration paid for the Vivacom
Acquisition and the estimated fair values of the net assets of Vivacom were recorded as goodwill.
The Company identified and measured significant identifiable assets such as: trade name,
customer base—fixed services, customer base—mobile services, licenses, software and
distribution network. The value of the items of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets increased significantly. As a result of the newly identified intangible assets and the
significant increase to the value of the existing items of property, plant and equipment, additional
amortization and depreciation charges were estimated and added as adjustments to the
Vivacom’s financial data for the seven months ended July 31, 2020. The amount of additional
amortization and depreciation was estimated based on the value allocated to specific assets and
the remaining useful life of those assets. The adjustments for the additional amortization and
depreciation charges amounted to €44.4 million and related tax benefit amounted to €4.4 million.

(e) The adjustments presented have been made to align Vivacom’s financial policies with IFRS as adopted
and applied by the Company under its currently applied accounting policies, and Vivacom (i) capitalizes
subscriber acquisition costs for contracts below one year, (ii) capitalizes portability costs, while such costs
are expensed as incurred by the Company and (iii) for related tax effects.

(3) Represent adjustment relating to refinancing calculated as follows:

**Nine months ended**

**September 30, 2020**

**(in € million)**

**Additional costs**

Interest on Vivacom’s 2020 Notes Financing for period from January 1,
2020 until the 2020 Notes Issue Date ............................................ (6.0)

**Reduction in costs** —

Reversal of interest on Company’s borrowings refinanced with Vivacom’s
2020 Notes Financing .............................................................. 3.1

Reversal of interest on Vivacom’s SFA loans refinanced with the 2020 Notes
Financing ............................................................................. 8.6

Reversal of deferred transaction costs on Vivacom’s SFA loans ............. 5.8

Reversal of costs relating to cancellation of swap contracts on Vivacom’s
SFA loans ............................................................................ 3.5

**Incremental interest (expense) / reduction ...................................** **15.0**

Tax impact of incremental interest expense ..................................... (1.1)

**Financing adjustments ............................................................** **13.9**

(a) Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information has been extracted from the Wind Hellas Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements without material adjustments. Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information is
prepared in euros.

(b) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Crystal Almond Midco’s line items to conform
to the Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to align Crystal Almond Midco’s accounting policies with the
Company’s accounting policies. Under its currently applied accounting policies, Crystal Almond Midco
capitalizes contract cost related to (i) commissions paid to dealers and franchisees categorized as
subscribers acquisition cost and (ii) fixed customer activation costs as contract costs and expenses the
related cost amortized in the income statement as “purchase, services and other expenses”, while in
accordance with the Company’s accounting policies such costs are capitalized as intangible assets and
amortized on profit and loss by the Company.


-----

(5) Represent adjustment relating to refinancing calculated as follows:

**Nine months ended**

**September 30, 2020**

**(in € million)**

**Refinancing costs**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes and related amortized cost ................ (34.3)

**Reduction in costs**

Reversal of interest and amortized cost on Wind Hellas Existing Notes ....... 17.6

Reversal of interest and amortized cost on Wind Hellas Revolving Credit
Facility ................................................................................... 1.3

**Incremental interest (expense) / reduction ......................................** **(15.4)**

Tax impact of incremental interest expense ........................................ 3.9

**Financing adjustments ...............................................................** **(11.5)**


Interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes was calculated using the following rates: % for Fixed Rate SSNs
and % +Euribor for the FRNs. Estimated interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes includes amortization
of debt issuance cost. No adjustment has been made for non-recurring future transaction costs relating to repayment
of existing financing and arranging additional intermediary and liquidity supporting financing. These expenses will
be incurred upon completion of the Transactions (transaction costs related to the Offering, redemption fees, costs
related to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, and fees related to the prepayment of the Bridge Facilities). See also Note 3
to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021.”

Interest charge on the borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility is not included in the adjustment.
The estimated amount of this charge is approximately €0.2 million per annum.

(6) An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions between Crystal Almond Midco and the other
members of the Target Group.

(7) As discussed in Note 4 to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet,” no purchase price allocation related to Crystal
Almond Midco was performed as at the date of this offering memorandum and therefore no fair value adjustments
have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), except as discussed
elsewhere and the entire difference between total consideration paid for the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the
historical book value of Crystal Almond Midco was assumed as goodwill. The Company expects to identify and
measure significant identifiable assets such as: customer base, licenses, trademark and technology related intangible
assets. Recognition of new depreciable assets or increase of value of existing intangible assets and items of property,
plant and equipment will cause additional amortization and depreciation charges. The amount of charge will depend
on value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of such assets. The estimation of the impact of
additional charges cannot be made as of the date of this offering memorandum. The additional depreciation and
amortization will reduce consolidated net income and retained earnings of the Group, and such reduction of net
income will be compensated by reduction of deferred tax liability deriving from differences between carrying value
of assets (after fair value adjustments) and tax values of assets. The additional depreciation and amortization and
related tax effect will not have any impact on our Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDAaL.

(8) Pro forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, assets
held for sale and overflow between periods. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases represents Pro
Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure as further adjusted to exclude the impact on right-of-use assets additions and,
starting from 2021, the right-of-use asset modifications and prepayments. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases are prepared based on management accounts and not
IFRS. A reconciliation of capital expenditure as calculated under IFRS to Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases is as follows:

**Pro forma Adjusted Capital**
**Expenditure after Leases.....................** **177.8** **45.1** **83.3** **306.2**

(9) Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are supplemental measures
of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are not a measurement of performance or liquidity
under IFRS and you should not consider Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDAaL as an alternative to (a) net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of our operating
performance), (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any other
measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL and the ratios derived therefrom, because we believe that they are measures
commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing our business. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL, as presented in this offering memorandum, however,
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these
measures are calculated. The reconciliation of these measure to net profit(loss) for the period is as follows:

_________________________

(a) Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information has been extracted from the Wind Hellas Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements without material adjustments. Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information is
prepared in euros.

(b) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Crystal Almond Midco’s line items to conform
to the Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to align Crystal Almond Midco’s accounting policies with the
Company’s accounting policies. Under its currently applied accounting policies, Crystal Almond Midco
capitalizes contract cost related to (i) commissions paid to dealers and franchisees categorized as
subscribers acquisition cost and (ii) fixed customer activation costs as contract costs and expenses the
related cost amortized in the income statement as “purchase, services and other expenses”, while in
accordance with the Company’s accounting policies such costs are capitalized as intangible assets and
amortized on profit and loss by the Company.

(3) An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions between Crystal Almond Midco and the other
members of the Target Group.

(4) Represent adjustment relating to refinancing calculated as follows:

**Last two quarters ended**

**September 30, 2021**

**(in € million)**

**Refinancing costs**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes and related amortized cost ............. (22.9)

**Reduction in costs**

Reversal of interest and amortized cost on Wind Hellas Existing Notes .... 11.7

Reversal of interest and amortized cost on Wind Hellas Revolving Credit
Facility ................................................................................ 0.4

**Incremental interest (expense) / reduction ...................................** **(10.8)**

Tax impact of incremental interest expense ..................................... 2.7

**Financing adjustments ............................................................** **(8.1)**

Interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes was calculated using the following rates: % for Fixed Rate SSNs
and % +Euribor for the FRNs. Estimated interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes includes amortization
of debt issuance cost. No adjustment has been made for non-recurring future transaction costs relating to repayment
of existing financing and arranging additional intermediary and liquidity supporting financing. These expenses will
be incurred upon completion of the Transactions (transaction costs related to the Offering, redemption fees, costs
related to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, and fees related to the prepayment of the Bridge Facilities). See also Note 3
to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021.”

Interest charge on the borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility is not included in the adjustment.
The estimated amount of this charge is approximately €0.2 million per annum


-----

(5) As discussed in Note 4 to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet,” no purchase price allocation related to Crystal
Almond Midco was performed as at the date of this offering memorandum and therefore no fair value adjustments
have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), except as discussed
elsewhere and the entire difference between total consideration paid for the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the
historical book value of Crystal Almond Midco was assumed as goodwill. The Company expects to identify and
measure significant identifiable assets such as: customer base, licenses, trademark and technology related intangible
assets. Recognition of new depreciable assets or increase of value of existing intangible assets and items of property,
plant and equipment will cause additional amortization and depreciation charges. The amount of charge will depend
on value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of such assets. The estimation of the impact of
additional charges cannot be made as of the date of this offering memorandum. The additional depreciation and
amortization will reduce consolidated net income and retained earnings of the Group, and such reduction of net
income will be compensated by reduction of deferred tax liability deriving from differences between carrying value
of assets (after fair value adjustments) and tax values of assets. The additional depreciation and amortization and
related tax effect will not have any impact on our Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDAaL.

(6) Pro forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, assets
held for sale and overflow between periods. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases represents Pro
Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure as further adjusted to exclude the impact on right-of-use assets additions and,
starting from 2021, the right-of-use asset modifications and prepayments. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases are prepared based on management accounts and not
IFRS. A reconciliation of capital expenditure as calculated under IFRS to Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases is as follows:

**Last two quarters ended**

**September 30, 2021**

**Adria Midco** **CAIHL** **Adria Midco Pro**

**Actual** **Adjusted** **Forma**

**Pro forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after**
**Leases ........................................................................** **315.3** **53.0** **368.2**

(7) Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are supplemental measures
of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are not a measurement of performance or liquidity
under IFRS and you should not consider Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDAaL as an alternative to (a) net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of our operating
performance), (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any other
measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL and the ratios derived therefrom, because we believe that they are measures
commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing our business. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL, as presented in this offering memorandum, however,
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these
measures are calculated. The reconciliation of these measure to net profit(loss) for the period is as follows:

_________________________

(a) Vivacom’s financial information has been derived from Note 30 to the Vivacom Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements. Financial information for the seven months ended July 31, 2020 is derived by taking
the financial data for nine months ended September 30, 2020 and subtracting the financial information for
the two months ended September 30, 2020 (which has not been reviewed or audited). The financial
information is prepared in Bulgarian levs (BGN).

(b) Amounts were converted using the BGN/euro exchange rate of BGN 1.95583 to €1.00, the pegged rate for
the period.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Vivacom’s line items to conform to the
Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(d) The purpose of the adjustment is to illustrate the effects of:

(i) _Eliminating the effect of transactions between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD_

The Group acquired Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (formerly, Viva Telecom Bulgaria OOD) in
the Vivacom Acquisition. Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD is a holding company of the Vivacom
Group but does not itself prepare consolidated financial information. The pro forma financial
information of Vivacom included herein is based on the Vivacom Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements and therefore certain adjustments are made to eliminate the effect of transactions
between Vivacom and Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD. An adjustment was made to eliminate
intercompany transactions, comprising an interest income amounting to €6.3 million and
reversal of impairment cost amounting to €0.3 million and related tax effects of €0.7 million.

(ii) _Purchase price allocation_


-----

The purchase price allocation was finalized as of December 31, 2020 and therefore the Company
Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the fair value
adjustments that have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated
deferred tax effects) and differences between total consideration paid for the Vivacom
Acquisition and the estimated fair values of the net assets of Vivacom were recorded as goodwill.
The Company identified and measured significant identifiable assets such as: trade name,
customer base—fixed services, customer base—mobile services, licenses, software and
distribution network. The value of the items of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets increased significantly. As a result of the newly identified intangible assets and the
significant increase to the value of the existing items of property, plant and equipment, additional
amortization and depreciation charges were estimated and added as adjustments to the
Vivacom’s financial data for the seven months ended July 31, 2020. The amount of additional
amortization and depreciation was estimated based on the value allocated to specific assets and
the remaining useful life of those assets. The adjustments for the additional amortization and
depreciation charges amounted to €44.4 million and related tax benefit amounted to €4.4 million.

(e) The adjustments presented have been made to align Vivacom’s financial policies with IFRS as adopted
and applied by the Company under its currently applied accounting policies, and Vivacom (i) capitalizes
subscriber acquisition costs for contracts below one year, (ii) capitalizes portability costs, while such costs
are expensed as incurred by the Company and (iii) for related tax effects.

(3) Represent adjustment relating to refinancing calculated as follows:

**Twelve months ended**

**December 31, 2020**

**(in € million)**

**Additional costs**

Interest on Vivacom’s 2020 Notes Financing for period from January 1,
2020 until the 2020 Notes Issue Date ............................................... (6.0)

**Reduction in costs** —

Reversal of interest on Company’s borrowings refinanced with Vivacom’s
2020 Notes Financing ................................................................. 3.1

Reversal of interest on Vivacom’s SFA loans refinanced with the 2020 Notes
Financing ................................................................................ 8.6

Reversal of deferred transaction costs on Vivacom’s SFA loans ................ 5.8

Reversal of costs relating to cancellation of swap contracts on Vivacom’s
SFA loans ............................................................................... 3.5

**Incremental interest (expense) / reduction ......................................** **15.0**

Tax impact of incremental interest expense ........................................ (1.1)

**Financing adjustments ...............................................................** **13.9**

The senior secured notes issued as part of the Vivacom’s 2020 Notes Financing were issued on February 6, 2020.
For the purposes of this “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information” section, additional interest for the period
from January 1, 2020 to the 2020 Notes Issue Date was calculated using the effective interest rates attributable to
Vivacom’s 2020 Notes Financing.

The remaining adjustments relate to reversal of costs included in the historical financial information of the Company
and of Vivacom are attributable to financing that was repaid from the proceeds of the 2020 Notes Financing.

(a) Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information has been extracted from the Wind Hellas Audited Financial
Statements without material adjustments. Crystal Almond Midco’s financial information is prepared in
euros.

(b) The adjustments presented have been made to reclassify Crystal Almond Midco’s line items to conform
to the Company’s basis of preparation. Such adjustments have no effect on profit for the period reported.

(c) The adjustments presented have been made to align Crystal Almond Midco’s accounting policies with the
Company’s accounting policies. Under its currently applied accounting policies, Crystal Almond Midco
capitalizes contract cost related to (i) commissions paid to dealers and franchisees categorized as
subscribers acquisition cost and (ii) fixed customer activation costs as contract costs and expenses the
related cost amortised in the income statement as “purchases, services and other expenses”, while in
accordance with the Company’s accounting policies such costs are capitalized as intangible assets and
amortized on profit and loss by the Company.

**Refinancing costs**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes and related amortized cost ................ (45.8)

**Reduction in costs** —

**Incremental interest (expense) / reduction ......................................** **(20.7)**

Tax impact of incremental interest expense ........................................ 5.2

**Financing adjustments ...............................................................** **(15.5)**


Interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes was calculated using the following rates: % for Fixed Rate SSNs
and % +Euribor for the FRNs. Estimated interest charge on the Senior Secured Notes includes amortization


-----

of debt issuance cost. No adjustment has been made for non-recurring future transaction costs relating to repayment
of existing financing and arranging additional intermediary and liquidity supporting financing. These expenses will
be incurred upon completion of the Transactions (transaction costs related to the Offering, redemption fees, costs
related to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, and fees related to the prepayment of the Bridge Facilities). See also Note 3
to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021.”

Interest charge on the borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility is not included in the adjustment.
The estimated amount of this charge is approximately €0.2 million per annum

(6) An adjustment was made to eliminate intercompany transactions between Crystal Almond Midco and the other
members of the Target Group.

(7) As discussed in Note 4 to the “Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet,” no purchase price allocation related to Crystal
Almond Midco was performed as at the date of this offering memorandum and therefore no fair value adjustments
have been made to acquired assets and liabilities (including any associated deferred tax effects), except as discussed
elsewhere and the entire difference between total consideration paid for the Wind Hellas Acquisition and the
historical book value of Crystal Almond Midco was assumed as goodwill. The Company expects to identify and
measure significant identifiable assets such as: customer base, licenses, trademark and technology related intangible
assets. Recognition of new depreciable assets or increase of value of existing intangible assets and items of property,
plant and equipment will cause additional amortization and depreciation charges. The amount of charge will depend
on value allocated to specific assets and the remaining useful life of such assets. The estimation of the impact of
additional charges cannot be made as of the date of this offering memorandum. The additional depreciation and
amortization will reduce consolidated net income and retained earnings of the Group, and such reduction of net
income will be compensated by reduction of deferred tax liability deriving from differences between carrying value
of assets (after fair value adjustments) and tax values of assets. The additional depreciation and amortization and
related tax effect will not have any impact on our Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDAaL.

(8) Pro forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure represents capital expenditure, as adjusted by intragroup adjustments, assets
held for sale and overflow between periods. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases represents Pro
Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure as further adjusted to exclude the impact on right-of-use assets additions and,
starting from 2021, the right-of-use asset modifications and prepayments. Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases are prepared based on management accounts and not
IFRS. A reconciliation of capital expenditure as calculated under IFRS to Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure
and Pro Forma Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases is as follows:

(9) Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are supplemental measures
of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL are not a measurement of performance or liquidity
under IFRS and you should not consider Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDAaL as an alternative to (a) net income (as determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of our operating
performance), (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs, or (c) any other
measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAaL and the ratios derived therefrom, because we believe that they are measures
commonly used by investors and they are measures that we use in managing our business. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro

###### THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

_The following review relates to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and_
_for the periods discussed below. “The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations” is based on the historical financial data included in this offering_
_memorandum and should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Data,” “Summary of_
_Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate_
_and Certain Other Financial Data,” “Selected Company Historical Financial Data,” the Company_
_Audited Financial Statements and the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements included in_
_this offering memorandum. Prospective investors should read the entire offering memorandum and not_
_just rely on the information set out below. The following discussion of our results of operations and_
_financial condition contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from_
_those that we discuss in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to_
_such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum,_
_particularly under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-looking Statements.”_

**Our Business Overview**

We are the leading telecommunications player in Southeastern Europe, with a unique media ecosystem
to complement our regional distribution capabilities. As of September 30, 2021, we provided services
to approximately 15.2 million RGUs and covered approximately 4.3 million homes passed after giving
effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition and other signed acquisitions. We offer a diverse and
differentiated line of products and services and are the clear multi-play leader in our footprint across
Slovenia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, with an
addressable market that comprised 13.4 million households as of September 30, 2021. We also produce
and distribute distinctive and attractive content for our Pay-TV channels across a wide range of media
formats. The Group’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €1,383.9 million,
and the UG Adjusted EBITDAaL for such period was €523.4 million. The Pro forma Group had RunRate Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended September 30, 2021 of €2,536.2 million and
Pro forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDAaL for September 30, 2021 was
€969.0 million.

We have grown rapidly through both value-accretive acquisitions and organic growth. In August 2021,
we signed an agreement to acquire Wind Hellas, a leading integrated telecommunications operator and
the number three mobile-telephony services provider in Greece, furthering our penetration into the
Greek market following our acquisition of Nova (formerly Forthnet S.A.) in 2020. After giving effect
to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, approximately 1/3 of our pro forma revenues for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 would have been derived in Greece. We have also made a number of smaller
acquisitions in Bulgaria, building on our leading positions following completion of the Vivacom
Acquisition in 2020 and the acquisition of Nova BG in 2021, and in Croatia, where we acquired Tele2
Croatia in 2020 and we have signed an agreement to acquire Optima Telekom in 2021. We have also
continued to expand our in-house media and content offering through acquisitions, with a focus on
expansion in euro or euro-pegged currency jurisdictions. We have significantly improved our business
profile in terms of scale, geographic exposure and currency mix and product diversification.


-----

We are a leading player in Pay-TV, broadband, fixed telephony and mobile telephony across the
jurisdictions in which we operate, as shown below:

___________________________

Source: Company information.
(1) Market position is based on total subscribers.

(2) We are the leading high-speed cable broadband internet provider in each of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria
within our footprint, overall leading provider in Slovenia within our footprint and out-of-footprint, and we have the second-largest
broadband and telephony market share in each of these countries, behind the respective incumbents with national footprints. In
Bulgaria, following the acquisition of Vivacom, we have the largest broadband and fixed-line telephony market share.

(3) Company Footprint RGUs consist of Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony Company RGUs.

(4) Company DTH RGUs in Slovenia include Company RGUs for DTH services provided in Slovenia and internationally, pre-paid
DTH services and Pink International (which distributes Pink channels in Western Europe) and DTH North Macedonia.

(5) Based on aggregated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (including Wind Hellas’ and Optima Telekom’s
revenues for the period), United Group’s Media Group’s external revenue represented 12% of our total aggregated revenue for the
same period; figures for Nova BG for the period prior to its acquisition by us are based on management accounts.

(6) This figure includes 1.9 million homes passed through Vivacom’s FTTP / VDSL network. Nova uses OTE’s wholesale Local Loop
Unbundling (LLU) and Bitstream services for its fixed network access across Greece; pro forma for the Wind Hellas.

(7) Most Cable RGUs for Nova represent broadband and fixed-telephony. Customers of Nova are serviced through a local loop
unbundling arrangement with the incumbent OTE.

Our in-house content business produces distinctive and attractive content for our Pay-TV channels and
has historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. We currently produce over 50% of the total content in our
national (terrestrial) and most of our Pay-TV operations, and our main prime-time programs typically
receive ratings of between 20% and 50% in the markets in which they are available. As part of our
media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution in our
markets. We are also a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content
owners because of our well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe.

Our core telecommunications business is complemented by our two OTT distribution platforms that
customers can access through internet-based streaming: (i) EON, our regional OTT platform in
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Greece, which enables customers connected to our
competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to access our attractive
portfolio of Pay-TV channels; and (ii) NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which delivers
ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we
launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online shopping platform, which offers more than 20


-----

popular product categories, and is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia
and Slovenia.

We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain and grow our market-leading positions, as we
provide a well-invested network, some of the fastest download speeds, access to desirable media content
and high-quality customer service, all of which has led to relatively low churn rates and high customer
loyalty. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their
everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand and makes our business more resilient to macroeconomic disruptions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic where we saw data and voice traffic
increase.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations**

The performance of our businesses, our results of operations and the key operating measures discussed
below have been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors. Certain of these factors are
discussed below.

**_Products, Services and Content_**

Our results are impacted by our product mix as well as our ability to introduce new products and
upgrades and successfully sell those products and upgrades to increase our RGUs and ARPUs. We
continually evaluate the suite of products and services we provide to our subscribers to ensure that we
remain competitive with other providers in our markets and have an opportunity to increase our
subscriber base and the number of products we sell to our subscribers. We accomplish this through
product innovation, investments in technology and acquisitions of complementary businesses. For
example, over the years we have expanded our product offering by introducing fixed-line services to
offer multi-play packages in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria and
Greece, including, depending on the relevant geographical market, pay television, broadband internet
access, fixed-line telephony, as well as mobile-telephony services in Slovenia and Croatia.

We believe that media and communications services customers will increasingly choose bundled
products because of the convenience and enhanced value resulting from obtaining TV, broadband
internet and telephony services from a single provider for one price. As of September 30, 2021, 86% of
our customer base in Slovenia, 80% of our customer base in Serbia, 88% of our customer base in Bosnia
and Herzegovina and 50% of our customer base in Bulgaria subscribed for one of our multi-play
packages (our customer base is calculated in each case based on unique cable subscribers by bundle).

We seek to be the leader in our markets in pay television content and have entered into long-term
strategic partnerships with key international and regional content owners. We have also acquired
leading regional content owners in key television sub-segments (sports, lifestyle, children and films),
such as providers of the Sport Klub family of channels (which includes Sport Klub, Golf Klub and our
fishing and hunting channels), N1, Fight Channel, Pikaboo and Cinemania. Our ability to maintain the
quality of our content impacts our ability to sell our pay television offerings, as well as bundled
packages.

Our product mix can also impact our margins. For example, our mobile-telephony business and our
content business generally have lower margins compared to our cable-based business. Our success in
growing these businesses may impact our product mix and therefore may affect UG Adjusted EBITDA
margins.

**_Pricing of Our Products and Services_**

Increasing demand for attractive content and higher broadband speeds allows us to increase the prices
at which we provide these services. We regularly review the prices of our products and services,
however, and in the past have adjusted our subscription fees as necessary in line with inflation, changes
in foreign exchange rates or in response to market conditions and content costs. Changes in the pricing


-----

of our products and services impact the revenues and margins that we generate from these products and
services as well as our ability to attract new customers. For example, our multi-play bundles offer
subscribers higher value in terms of channels, speeds functionality and add on features. The pricing of
all our services, including our multi-play bundles, is dependent on market conditions, pricing by
competitors with similar offerings and the perceived quality of our products versus other products. In
some of our countries of operations we may also become subject to price regulations. See “—
_Regulation.”_

**_Subscriber Churn_**

The television, broadband internet and telephony industries exhibit churn as a result of high levels of
competition. In addition to competitive alternatives, churn levels may be affected by changes in our
prices or our competitors’ prices, our level of subscriber satisfaction, subscriber mortality and the
relocation of subscribers, as well as from the termination of agreements. An increase in churn may lead
to increased costs and reduced revenues when subscribers cancel our services as we incur additional
marketing and advertising costs to find new subscribers.

Demand for attractive content and higher broadband speeds allows us to increase the prices at which
we provide these services while maintaining relatively low churn rates, which we believe provides us
with recurring cash flows and visibility with respect to future revenues. We have historically
experienced low churn rates in our television, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony businesses,
and the churn we have experienced in these businesses has primarily been driven by customers moving
outside of our geographic area of services as well as their inability to pay. Only a limited amount of
churn was driven by competition. We believe that launching telephony in our markets, further driving
digitization, providing our subscribers with multi-play packages, expanding our cable footprint to
broaden our geographic reach and benefiting from increasing disposable incomes in the region
(reducing the likelihood of customers’ bad debt), will allow us to maintain low churn rates for cable
Pay-TV. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our churn rates have decreased as
customers have been less likely or unable to easily migrate to another provider during the pandemic.

The churn rates for our mobile post-paid subscribers are higher than the churn rates for our fixed-line
telephony services, as it is easier for mobile subscribers to switch to our competitors since there are no
infrastructure limitations. Similarly, the churn rate of mobile pre-paid subscribers is relatively higher
because of the non-contractual nature of the relationship with such subscribers. We believe, however,
that we have developed an attractive suite of fixed mobile convergence services in Slovenia which,
among other things, has positively impacted the churn of our mobile post-paid subscribers in Slovenia.
Since our acquisition of Tušmobil, our number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia has increased to
40% of our subscribers as of September 30, 2021, from 1% of our subscribers prior to the acquisition.
The blended annual churn rate of our Slovenia Group segment’s mobile post-paid subscribers as of
September 30, 2021, was 10%, compared to 11% as of January 31, 2017. We define blended annual
churn as net lost subscribers (the number of customers that either on a voluntary or involuntary basis
no longer subscribe for a certain service) divided by the number of all unique cable subscribers at the
beginning of period, which result is then annualized. We have been using the principles learned through
our acquisition of Tušmobil and our experience providing mobile services in Slovenia to inform the
operation of our mobile-telephony business in Bulgaria and Croatia.

**_Cost of Services Provided_**

Our most significant costs include (i) carriage fees which we pay to international and regional
broadcasters such as Fox, Discovery and Pink, to carry their programs on our distribution network, (ii)
licensing fees payable to sports rights owners such as UEFA, the English Premier League, Spanish
Primera League, ATP and Formula 1, to develop content for our own channels, (iii) satellite capacity
costs, (iv) payroll costs, (v) internet and interconnection fees, (vi) costs of materials used to connect
subscribers to our network and (vii) costs for marketing and sales. Most of our costs, such as a portion
of our network operations, customer care, billing and administration costs, are relatively fixed, while a


-----

portion of our marketing and customer services cost is variable. Our content acquisition costs are mostly
fixed and a decreasing portion of these costs are subscriber based. Where possible, we aim to negotiate
fixed rate content costs. This approach allows us to anticipate the input price of our content and price
our products accordingly. However, the costs associated with the growth of our business, such as RGU
acquisition costs, which are primarily comprised of campaign costs and sales costs for attracting new
subscribers, are variable costs.

A large portion of our costs is content costs, accounting for 18% of our operating expenses (not
including depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) for the nine months ended September 30,
2021. While we own a portion of our content, we are dependent on broadcasters and other content
owners for most of our programming. We pay license fees to several regional and international
broadcasters in order to broadcast their programs. For on-demand content purchased by our subscribers,
we generally pay a revenue share of the retail price, subject, for certain on demand content, to fixed
minimum guarantees. For packaged on-demand content (subscription video on-demand), we pay on a
per subscriber basis, sometimes with minimum guarantees. We generally expect that our content costs
(above the minimum amounts) will increase in line with increased revenues from digital Pay-TV and
on demand content. In the past we have successfully obtained rebates and discounts for our content, but
these may not continue in the future.

We pay fees to satellite operators to uplink and transmit our content to our DTH subscribers, and we
also use other network operators to connect telephone calls of our customers to customers of their
respective networks (interconnection). Generally, the amount we pay in interconnection fees in any
period will depend on the level of usage of our services.

Our staff cost is impacted by the number of personnel we employ, the experience levels at which such
persons are employed and increases in salaries and bonuses due to performance factors. Labor costs of
technicians, spent on the construction and upgrade of our network and acquisition of subscribers, are
capitalized as tangible and intangible assets.

RGU acquisition costs include campaign costs and sales costs. We aim to recover RGU acquisition
costs over the duration of the service contract. Factors that contribute to successful recovery of RGU
acquisition costs include our operational efficiency, the density of our subscriber base and our direct
relationships with our subscribers, which enables us not to rely on intermediaries to interact with our
customers.

**_Network and Technological Advances_**

Our ability to provide new high definition and on demand digital TV services, broadband internet access
at higher speeds and telephony services to subscribers depends, in part, on our ability to upgrade and
maintain our network. We incur capital expenditure charges in periods over which these upgrades are
made, with the aim of recouping these investments through increased revenues and profitability.

In particular, we expect certain communications technologies that are currently under development, 5G
technology in particular, to become increasingly important in our markets. We successfully tested and
are rolling out our next generation 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. In Slovenia, 5G
3600 MHz deployment and commercial launch began in June 2021, following a successful frequency
auction result in April 2021. In Bulgaria, 5G has been launched commercially using 4G 1900 MHz
spectrum in September 2020, which was the first available 5G service in the market, and in May 2021,
we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. In Croatia, we
secured 15-year spectrum licenses for 5G frequencies in July 2021, and commenced the deployment
and commercial launch of our 5G C-Band in September 2021. We believe that significant investments
in 5G technology will be critical to remain competitive in the mobile market and meet our customers’
needs.


-----

Our ability to compete effectively and maintain or increase our customer base depends on our ability to
anticipate and react quickly to technological developments and evolving industry standards and develop
successful new and enhanced products and services to adapt to changes in our market. We invest in new
or enhanced technologies, products or services in periods over which industry standards change, or to
upgrade our technologies proactively. Additionally, we incur capital expenditure costs relating to the
replacement of existing equipment. We expect to incur substantial capital expenditure costs in the future
relating to new 4G and 5G frequencies and the installation of new equipment.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

We operate across Southeastern Europe, generating revenues in many local currencies, which fluctuate
from time to time in relation to the euro. Our revenues in Slovenia, Montenegro and Greece are
generated in euro. We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we must
translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency
other than the euro into euros at then applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases
in the value of these currencies against the euro may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, revenue
and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if
their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could significantly affect the
comparability of our results between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying
value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity.

We record the financial results of our Serbia, Bosnia, Bulgaria and Croatia Group segments in Serbian
dinar, Bosnian and Herzegovinian mark, Bulgarian lev and Croatian kuna, respectively, which are then
translated into euros in preparing our consolidated financial statements. In the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, 37% of our revenue was generated in euros or currencies pegged to the euro, with
15%, 4%, 35% and 13% of our revenue generated in Serbian dinars, Bosnian and Herzegovinian mark,
Bulgarian lev and Croatian kuna, respectively. While the Bosnian and Herzegovinian mark is pegged
against the euro at a fixed exchange rate of BAM 1.9558 per €1.00 and the Bulgarian lev is pegged
against the euro at a fixed exchange rate of BGN 1.9558 per €1.00, the Serbian dinar freely fluctuates
against the euro. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the value of the Serbian dinar remained
stable relative to the euro. However, due to the historic indexation of the Serbian dinar against the
German mark, which was replaced by the euro in 2002, we believe the Serbian consumer price index
closely tracks the depreciation of the Serbian dinar against the euro which has historically allowed us
to “pass through” a portion of the impact of the depreciation of the dinar to our customers. We believe
that our pricing strategy reflects this “pass through” principle. In the nine months ended September 30,
2021, the value of the Croatian kuna increased approximately 1% relative to the euro compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Additionally, certain of our expenses, primarily content and satellite costs, are denominated in euros
and U.S. dollars. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid in
the same currency, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. A
substantial portion of our indebtedness is denominated in euros. Based on our lack of any material
change in exposure to the U.S. dollar in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we did not enter
into any additional currency hedge agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

**_Growth in Our Markets_**

Three of our key markets—Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro—are generally
characterized by lower internet broadband household penetration rates compared to elsewhere in
Western Europe and the CEE region and both Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have lower pay
television household penetration rates compared to elsewhere in Western Europe and the CEE region.
As a result, growth in our markets has been higher than in certain CEE and Western Europe
jurisdictions. We believe this is primarily due to the increasing importance of high-quality broadband
internet and an increasing convergence of our regions with the EU. Slovenia is a more mature market,
with subscriber rates similar to the CEE region, and as a result, growth in that market will depend more


-----

on our ability to effectively compete with other market participants and to continue to offer high-quality
customer propositions. Croatia is a member of the EU with relatively high GDP per capita and growth
rates, and as a result it is an attractive market for our continued expansion. The Croatian mobile market
is characterized by high market stability, as it has a low level of fragmentation and disruption, with only
three MNOs in the market (including us), and the country’s telecommunications infrastructure is highly
dependent on mobile access, with one of the highest mobile ARPU among CEE countries. We believe
that our growth in this market will depend on several factors, such as the ability to expand our territorial
coverage as well as improve the quality of our network and customer support services, including
through investments to increase our capacity and quality levels and through the continued development
of our digital and sales channels. Bulgaria experienced relatively strong real GDP growth at an average
rate of 3.1% per year between 2016 and 2019. Economic activity in Bulgaria shrank by 4.4% in 2020
due to the COVID-19 pandemic (according to the BNSI). The Greek telecommunications market is
characterized by intense competition. This market is concentrated among four main operators with a
focus on fixed-mobile convergent offerings. The total fixed-line market has stable with limited fixedto-mobile substitution, while the broadband market continues to grow at the expense of voice-only lines.
NGA subscribers (those with broadband speeds of greater than 30 Mbps) comprise approximately onethird of total broadband subscribers, but this level remains low compared with the EU average of over
60%. Pay-TV penetration is also low compared to EU averages, with 26% of Greek households
subscribing to Pay-TV. In Greece, the majority of Pay-TV subscribers are served through DTH
technology, while the remainder is served through IPTV.

In each of our markets, a number of factors impacts the rate of growth of pay television, broadband
internet and telephony industries, including economic conditions, political stability, increases in
infrastructure and an increased distribution of wealth. Furthermore, these industries may not grow at
the same rate as they have in the past.

**_Regulation_**

Our operations are subject to various regulations in Europe and in our regional markets. We are
generally free from retail price regulation. Since January 2017, we are no longer considered a significant
market participant in the Pay-TV market in Serbia, thus our Basic TV package is no longer subject to
price regulation, although this may change in the future, and we regularly monitor the market to stay
aware of market conditions which may lead to price regulation. In Croatia, we are currently subject to
price regulation only with respect to fixed and mobile termination rates charged by operators to each
other for interconnection services, which are regulated in the whole European Union. In addition, in
Serbia we are subject to price regulation only to the extent we are required to provide access to our
wholesale network.

However, in Serbia we are currently deemed to have SMP on the wholesale market for call termination
in public telephone networks and the wholesale market of central access at a fixed location for mass
market products, which imposes certain regulatory obligations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Our Business and Industry—We may become subject to more extensive regulation due to our scale.”_
We also implemented price increases in January 2018, which the Serbian Commission for Protection of
Competition investigated, but ultimately accepted. In addition, we may be subject to conditions imposed
in connection with competition authority clearances as we continue to expand our business through bolt
on, value accretive acquisitions and we may be subject to market power analysis from the relevant
regulators, which could force us to adjust our prices or sell various parts of our businesses. See also
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may become subject to more
_extensive regulation due to our scale” and “Our Business—Regulatory Framework.”_

**_Tax Treatment in Local Jurisdictions_**

The results of our operations depend on our tax treatment under the tax laws and regulations of local
jurisdictions. For instance, in Serbia, taxable income can be reduced in the same proportion as capital
expenditure for the year in Serbia divided by the carrying amount of assets in Serbia. Due to our


-----

significant capital expenditure in Serbia in 2016, we believe we have satisfied the requirements to be
granted a ten year tax beneficial status, expiring in 2025, and we recorded beneficial tax treatment for
our Serbia Group segment for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2021. Additionally, under thin capitalization rules in Serbia, interest and related
costs under intercompany loans are recognized as deductible expenses to the extent the intercompany
loans do not exceed four times the borrower’s equity. In 2017 and 2018, SBB Serbia did not capitalize
any intercompany loans. On December 27, 2018, the Serbian Tax Authority notified us that it had begun
a tax investigation of SBB Serbia for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Serbian Tax Authority
issued a decision in March 2019 that it had recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia
under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain debt and equity conversions) as dividends, which
would have been subject to a 5% withholding tax, and found a total contingent liability in respect of
this decision amounting to €21 million, including late interest. On October 12, 2020, the Serbian
Ministry of Finance annulled the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision and instructed the Serbian Tax
Authority to restart the procedure. The Serbian Tax Authority has also informed SBB Serbia that it is
opening a tax review for the years 2013 through 2016. We intend to continue contesting the Serbian
Tax Authority’s findings. For more information, see “Our Business—Legal Proceedings—Investigation
_by the Serbian Tax Authority.”_

Furthermore, in Slovenia, we may use a tax allowance for investment in equipment and intangible assets
(available for investments made after January 1, 2008), whereby the tax allowance is limited to 40% of
the value of the assets, up to the amount of the tax base. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, Telemach Slovenia
used the tax allowance for investments in the amount of €11.5 million, €10.5 million and €9.3 million,
respectively.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a taxpayer who invests more than BAM 20.0 million (€10.2 million) in
production assets (property, plant and equipment) within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for
five consecutive years is relieved from 50% of taxation on such investments for a period of five years,
starting from the first year in which it has invested at least BAM 4 million (€2.0 million). Pursuant to
this provision, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, we received a tax allowance for investments in the amount of
BAM 6.1 million (€3.1 million), BAM 6.8 million (€3.5 million) and BAM 2.7 million (€1.4 million),
respectively. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a taxpayer receives a tax allowance when it employs certain
types of employees, and in 2018, 2019 and 2020, we received a tax allowance for certain new employees
in the amount of BAM 1.3 million (€0.7 million), BAM 2.0 million (€1.0 million) and BAM 2.9 million
(€1.5 million), respectively.

In Greece, the corporate income tax rate was set at 24% for income generated in tax years 2019 and
2020, and it is currently set at 22% for income generated in tax year 2021 and onward. From January 1,
2020, withholding taxes on dividends were reduced from 10% to 5%, and on July 1, 2020, Greece
implemented a participation exemption for capital gains from the sale of Greek and EU subsidiaries.
For internet services, customers are charged a 5% tax on top of internet subscriptions (in addition to
VAT of 24%). In addition, a 10% tax on top of Pay-TV subscriptions for Greek operators (in addition
to VAT of 24%) has been imposed, although this has been suspended until June 30, 2022.

**_Implementation of Accounting Policies and Accounting Updates_**

_IFRS 16 Leases_

IFRS 16 introduced for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 a single, on
balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease
payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items
available on a voluntary basis. Lessor accounting remains similar to the previous standard—i.e., lessors
continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases.


-----

Under IFRS 16, we recognize new assets and liabilities for our operating leases of satellite capacity,
office facilities, parts of our infrastructure and base stations and the right-of-use of water and land. The
nature of expenses related to those leases changed because we recognized a depreciation charge for
right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. Previously, we recognized operating lease
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to
the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized.
There has been no significant impact for our finance leases in which we are the lessor.

We applied the simplified transition approach and did not restate comparative amounts for the year prior
to first adoption. Right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on transition as if the new rules
had always been applied. All other right-of-use assets have been measured at the amount of the lease
liability on adoption (adjusted for any pre-paid or accrued lease expenses).

_IFRIC 23_

In June 2017, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting
treatment of uncertainties in income taxes, specifically in relation to taxable profit or loss, tax bases,
unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments
under IAS 12.

IFRIC 23 states that an entity should assume that the applicable taxation authority will have full
knowledge of all relevant information when examining amounts reported to it. An entity therefore has
to consider whether it is probable that the applicable authority will accept a certain tax treatment in the
entity’s income tax filing and either adopt an approach consistent with the tax treatment in its income
tax filings or use the expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit or loss, tax
bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates.

IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early
adoption permitted. In adopting IFRIC 23, we applied a modified retrospective approach whereby the
cumulative effect of initially applying IFRIC 23, if any, should be recognized in opening equity at the
date of initial application. As part of our adoption of IFRIC 23, we have not identified any additional
material income tax uncertainties for which we would be required to recognize a related tax liability.

_Other_

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we have also applied certain other amendments to
existing accounting standards that did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods
and that are not expected to significantly affect current or future periods.

**Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_Acquisition History_**

Since January 1, 2018, we have significantly expanded our business by acquiring and integrating a large
number of cable TV operators, mobile-telephony service providers, B2B service providers and ISPs.

In 2021, we acquired Nova BG, Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, from Advance
Media Group EAD for a consideration of €290.6 million. Nova BG’s operations comprise 10 television
channels, including NOVA TV which broadcasts throughout Bulgaria, Bulgaria’s largest online
platform, Net Info, that reaches on average 80% of the Bulgarian population each month, and four radio
stations. The acquisition was completed in January 2021. In February 2021, we also completed the
acquisition of the remaining shares of Grand Production.

Between March and September 2021, we signed agreements to acquire, or completed the acquisition
of, the entire share capital or stakes in various other companies, including Serbian newspaper Dan Graf
(operating under the Brand Danas), local internet and TV operators Net 1 EOOD and ComNet Sofia


-----

EAD, Digital Cable Television EOOD (N3), Serbian distribution company D Express, local internet
and TV operators Networx-Bulgaria EOOD, TVN Distribution Bulgaria EOOD and Telco
Infrastructures EOOD in Bulgaria, Mainstream in Serbia, and Bulgarian newspaper business Vestnik
Telegraf EOOD. In May 2021, we acquired the remaining shares in Nova following a mandatory tender
offer and a squeeze-out procedure.

On July 9, 2021, we announced that we reached an agreement to acquire a majority interest of 54.31%
in Croatian telecom operation Optima Telekom for an estimated purchase price of €85 million based on
an enterprise value of HRK 639 million, from Hrvatski Telekom and Zagrebacka Banka. Optima
Telekom offers a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately 111 thousand
subscribers and pay-TV services to approximately 56 thousand subscribers in Croatia. The Optima
Telekom Acquisition was also subject to the implementation of certain changes in the Croatian
telecommunication legislation relating to vertical integration between pay-TV broadcasters and
distributors, which were implemented in October 2021. The Optima Telekom Acquisition was approved
by the Croatian Competition Agency on December 21, 2021 and is expected to complete in January
2022. The acquisition of Optima Telekom will allow us to further expand our presence in the Croatian
market enabling Telemach Croatia to offer a full range of telecommunication services, including payTV, through its existing infrastructure. Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we
will be required to undertake a tender offer for the remaining shares of Optima Telekom not yet
acquired.

Please refer to Note 21 to the Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements for additional
information regarding business combinations in the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

On August 14, 2021, we entered into the Wind Hellas Acquisition Agreement with the Seller to acquire
Crystal Almond Midco, an indirect parent of Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A., a leading
integrated telecommunications operator and the number three mobile-telephony services provider in
Greece, furthering our penetration into the Greek market following our acquisition of Nova in 2020.
The Wind Hellas Acquisition was approved by the European Commission on December 21, 2021, and
we expect it to be consummated on or about January 12, 2022. See “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Wind Hellas Acquisition.”_

On August 20, 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in Tessa Energy
EOOD in Bulgaria, for a consideration of €7 million, and the transaction was completed on November
30, 2021. Tessa Energy EOOD is expected to invest in the Kremena Wind Park, which has 70MW
capacity. With this investment, we will be producing more energy than we currently consume in
Bulgaria, which we expect will significantly decrease our carbon footprint.

On November 9, 2021, we acquired a 33% stake in Marquee TV, a specialist streaming service for arts
and culture, for a consideration of £4.8 million.

On November 30, 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire Telnet OOD, a cable operator in Bulgaria.
Completion of the transaction is subject to customary approvals, which are currently pending.

In addition, we are currently in discussions to acquire a majority interest in Telelink Business Services
Group AD, a technology company in Bulgaria. The transaction is subject to ongoing negotiations, due
diligence and customary approvals.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in a variety of ways. Our results for the period during which
an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion or exclusion of the results of the acquired or
disposed of business in our consolidated results. In addition, the results of the acquired businesses after
their acquisition may be impacted positively by synergies. We may also experience an increase in
operating expenses, including staff cost, as we integrate the acquired business into our network.
Acquisitions may also result in higher levels of depreciation and amortization expense. In addition,
because acquired entities are consolidated from the date of their acquisition and disposed of entities are


-----

no longer consolidated from the date of their disposition, the full impact of an acquisition or disposition
is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent periods. As a result, the historical results
of operations for the periods presented in this offering memorandum may not be comparable with each
other. See “Our Business—History” for a discussion of these acquisitions.

**_Our Segment Reporting_**

We are a pan regional distribution platform of cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet and
telephony services with various offerings in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Greece. Our business has grown substantially in terms of
scale, geographic reach and service offering during the period under review through both organic
growth and acquisitions. In addition, the corporate organization of our business has changed during this
period as our business has grown and been integrated. As a consequence of these changes, our Grouplevel financial reporting has evolved during the last several years.

In order to provide a meaningful analysis of our results of operations during the period under review,
in addition to a discussion of our Group-level consolidated results of operations based on IFRS
measures, we also present a discussion of revenues, UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure after Leases of our business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and
2020, and the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments,” we present our segment data in the notes to the Company Audited
Financial Statements. In Note 7 to the 2020 Company Audited Financial Statements and Note 5 to the
Company Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, we separately report segment results for nine
business segments: Slovenia Group segment, Serbia Group segment, Bosnia Group segment,
Montenegro Group segment, Croatia Group segment, Bulgaria Group segment, Greece Group segment,
Media Group segment, and Other segments. For more information, please refer to Note 7 to the 2020
Company Audited Financial Statements, Note 5 to the Company Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements and “Presentation of Financial Data—Company Segment Reporting.”

**Key Operating Measures**

We use several key operating measures, including homes passed, unique subscribers, RGUs and ARPU,
to track the performance of our business. None of these terms are measures of financial performance
under IFRS, nor have these measures been reviewed by an outside auditor, consultant or expert. These
measures are derived from management information systems. As these terms are defined by our
management, they may not be comparable to similar terms used by other companies.

**_Unique Subscribers, RGUs and ARPU_**

Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or
more of our cable-based services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a
cable unique subscriber is typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other
services such as broadband internet access and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique
cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services, thereby accounting for only one unique
cable subscriber, but several RGUs.

DTH subscribers represent the number of individuals across the six Southeastern European markets
(Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro and North Macedonia) who have
subscribed to our DTH Pay-TV services. We believe that most of these subscribers are outside of our
cable footprint. Typically, DTH subscribers are only able to subscribe to DTH based Pay-TV services
and represent a single RGU. However, we are re selling ADSL services purchased from our competitors
in the respective markets to DTH subscribers.

Average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are
realizing potential revenues from subscribers. ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month


-----

in a given period, the total subscription related revenues for that particular month divided by the average
number of subscribers for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the
period.

The following table sets forth certain of our key operating measures as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and
2021:

___________________________

(1) Homes passed represents all homes (households) ready to be connected directly to our fixed-line network.

(2) Unique cable subscribers represent the number of individual end-users who have subscribed to one or more of our
cable-based services. In all of our cable markets, cable Pay-TV is the basic service that a cable unique subscriber is
typically required to subscribe to in order to receive the Group’s other services such as broadband internet access
and telephony, with the exception of Bulgaria. A unique cable subscriber may subscribe to several different services,
thereby accounting for only one unique cable subscriber, but several RGUs.

(3) Cable Pay-TV RGUs includes (i) the sum of our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Slovenia, (ii) our total
analog cable Pay-TV RGUs (without separately counting analog cable RGUs that have purchased digital top ups) in
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro and (iii) our analog and digital cable Pay-TV RGUs in Bulgaria.

(4) DTH subscribers represent the number of individuals across Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Greece, Montenegro and North Macedonia who have subscribed to our DTH pay-TV services. We believe most of
these subscribers are outside of our cable footprint. Typically, DTH subscribers are only able to subscribe to DTH
based pay-TV services and represent a single RGU. However, we re-sell ADSL services purchased from our
competitors in the respective markets to DTH subscribers.

(5) OTT consists of our NetTV Plus and out-of-footprint EON subscribers.

(6) Broadband internet RGUs represents residential broadband internet provided within our network footprint.

(7) Fixed-line telephony RGUs represents residential fixed-line telephony provided within our network footprint.

(8) Mobile RGUs represents mobile-telephony services provided to customers in Slovenia, where we have operated as
an MNO since our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015. Following completion of the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia
in March 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia, and following the completion of the
acquisition of Vivacom in July 2020, we also provide mobile-telephony services in Bulgaria.

(9) Out-of-footprint includes multichannel multipoint distribution service-based services, ADSL internet services and
cable services provided outside of our network footprint.


-----

(10) RGU Penetration represents for cable Pay-TV the number of unique cable subscribers at the end of the relevant
period as a percentage of the number of homes passed by our network, and for broadband internet the number of
RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of unique cable subscribers.

(11) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV,
broadband internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixed-line telephony usage revenues and excluding
minor installation fees) for that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that
month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include
mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year ended December 31,
2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, €10.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and €8.9
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We calculate mobile ARPU by adding together, for each month in a
given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of other networks
roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number
of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the total number of months in the period.

(12) As of January 1, 2019, we changed our reporting methodology in regards to certain key operating measures, which
has resulted in immaterial differences as compared to previous periods. For the year ended December 31, 2018, OTT
users on our network have been reclassified to Cable and Cable services users on other networks have been
reclassified to Out-of-footprint from Cable. This change has an immaterial effect on all subscriber, RGU, ARPU and
churn data for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such key operating measures have been restated for such
period in line with this new reporting methodology.

The following table provides a breakdown of our key operating measures for our Slovenia Group
segment, Serbia Group segment, Bosnia Group segment, Montenegro Group segment, Croatia Group
segment, Bulgaria Group segment and Greece Group segment as of the dates and for the periods

_Group—Nine months ended September 30, 2021 Compared to the Nine months ended September 30,_
_2020_

Homes passed increased by 158 thousand, or 4%, from 3,669 thousand as of September 30, 2020, to
3,826 thousand as of September 30, 2021, primarily due to organic network expansion and acquisitions
of operators in Bulgaria.

As of September 30, 2021, we had 1,609 thousand cable Pay-TV RGUs, an increase of 116 thousand
compared to 1,492 thousand as of September 30, 2020, primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions
of operators, such as N3 and Net 1, in Bulgaria.

The total number of DTH Pay-TV RGUs amounted to 1,008 thousand as of September 30, 2021, a 43%
increase year-on-year, primarily due to the acquisition of Nova.

As of September 30, 2021, we had 1,513 thousand broadband internet RGUs, representing an increase
of 11%, compared to 1,369 thousand as of September 30, 2020. This is primarily attributable to the
acquisitions of operators in Bulgaria, such as N3 and Net 1, an increase in multi-play subscriptions over
this period and organic subscriber growth.

The total number of fixed-telephony RGUs decreased to 1,252 thousand as of September 30, 2021, a
decrease of 2% compared to 1,272 thousand as of September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due
to the declining use of fixed-telephony and the fixed-to-mobile substitution trend at Vivacom. The
number of fixed-telephony RGUs in other segments in the same period increased by 35 thousand as a
result of the growth in multi-play subscriptions over the period and organic subscriber growth.

Our OTT RGUs as of September 30, 2021 increased by 6% to 131 thousand, compared to 123 thousand
as of September 30, 2020.

Our mobile service RGUs increased from 4,538 thousand as of September 30, 2020 to 4,651 thousand
as of September 30, 2021. This is an increase of 112 thousand, or 2%, which was primarily driven by
organic growth in all of our countries of operation.

Our total RGUs increased by 18%, from 9,577 thousand as of September 30, 2020 to 11,323 thousand
as of September 30, 2021. RGUs added over this period were primarily the result of the acquisition of
Nova (1,375 thousand RGUs) and other operators in Bulgaria, such as N3 and Net 1, as well as organic
growth of cable Pay-TV and mobile services and a growing proportion of multi-play subscribers.

_Group—Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019_

Homes passed increased by 1,834 thousand, or 99%, from 1,852 thousand as of December 31, 2019 to
3,686 thousand as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of Vivacom (1,750 thousand)
and organic network expansion.

As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,476 thousand cable Pay-TV RGUs, an increase of 308 thousand
compared to 1,168 thousand as of December 31, 2019, as a result of the acquisition of Vivacom and
organic growth.

The total number of DTH Pay-TV RGUs amounted to 999 thousand as of December 31, 2020, a 124%
decrease as compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to the acquisitions of Vivacom and Nova.

As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,389 thousand broadband internet RGUs, representing an increase
of 62%, compared to 856 thousand at December 31, 2019. This is primarily attributable to the
acquisition of Vivacom, an increase in multi-play subscriptions and organic subscriber growth.

The total number of fixed-telephony RGUs increased to 1,270 thousand as of December 31, 2020, an
increase of 83%, compared to 695 thousand as of December 31, 2019. This is primarily the result of the


-----

acquisition of Vivacom, as well as an increase in multi-play subscriptions over this period and organic
subscriber growth.

Our OTT RGUs as of December 31, 2020 increased by 4% to 129 thousand, compared to 124 thousand
as of December 31, 2018.

Our mobile service RGUs increased from 550 thousand as of December 31, 2019 to 4,483 thousand as
of December 31, 2020. This is an increase of 3,933 thousand, or 715%, driven by the acquisition of
Vivacom and Telemach Croatia (2,938 thousand and 937 thousand mobile RGUs, respectively) and
organic growth in Slovenia.

Our total RGUs increased by 178%, from 3,917 thousand as of December 31, 2019 to 10,897 thousand
as of December 31, 2020. RGUs added over this period were mainly the result of the acquisitions of
Vivacom (4,461 thousand RGUs), Telemach Croatia (937 thousand mobile RGUs) and Nova (1,375
thousand RGUs), as well as organic growth of cable Pay-TV and mobile services and a growing
proportion of multi- play subscribers.

_Group—Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018_

Homes passed increased by 19 thousand, or 1%, from 1,833 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to 1,852
thousand as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to organic network expansion.

As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,168 thousand cable Pay-TV RGUs, an increase of 3 thousand
compared to 1,166 thousand as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to organic growth.

The total number of DTH Pay-TV RGUs amounted to 446 thousand as of December 31, 2019, a 4%
decrease as compared to 463 as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased competition,
migration from DTH to our cable services (due to expansion of our network) and subscriber base
cleaning.

As of December 31, 2019, we had 856 thousand broadband internet RGUs, representing an increase of
4%, compared to 822 thousand at December 31, 2018. This is primarily attributable to an increase in
multi-play subscriptions and organic subscriber growth.

The total number of fixed-telephony RGUs increased to 695 thousand as of December 31, 2019, an
increase of 8%, compared to 644 thousand as of December 31, 2018. This positive trend is primarily
due to an increase in multi-play subscriptions and organic subscriber growth. Our fixed-line telephony
RGUs as of December 31, 2018 have been restated by 17 thousand RGUs, from 661 thousand RGUs to
644 thousand RGUs, due to the reclassification of fixed-line telephony RGUs outside our network
footprint to “Out-of-footprint”. This reclassification mainly involved Telemach Slovenia, affecting 14
thousand fixed-line telephony RGUs.

Our OTT RGUs as of December 31, 2019 increased by 2% to 124 thousand, compared to 122 thousand
as of December 31, 2018, primarily due to new content offered to customers. This figure includes 13
thousand OTT RGUs in Serbia and Slovenia.

Our mobile service RGUs increased from 512 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to 550 thousand as of
December 31, 2019. This is an increase of 38 thousand, or 7%, driven by organic growth in Slovenia.

Our total RGUs increased by 3%, from 3,788 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to 3,917 thousand as
of December 31, 2019. RGUs added over this period were a result of the organic growth of cable PayTV, telephony, mobile, internet and other services, as well as a growing proportion of multi-play
subscribers.

_____________________________

(1) Figures for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 for our Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece segments are derived from management accounts and are included for presentation purposes
only, as the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia, the acquisition of Vivacom and the acquisition of Nova were completed on March 3, 2020, July 31, 2020 and November 12, 2020, respectively.

(2) Our ARPU is presented in euro per month (excluding VAT) for the periods indicated. ARPU from broadband internet includes value added services subscriptions, including online
backup, internet security and anti-virus services.

(3) In August 2019, mobile interconnection revenues (€40 thousand) were reclassified as telephony interconnection revenues.

(4) Blended Cable ARPU is calculated by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total cable Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony revenues (including fixedline telephony usage revenues and excluding minor installation fees) for that particular month divided by the average number of unique cable subscribers for that month and then dividing
that sum by the total number of months in the period. Blended Cable ARPU does not include mobile ARPU, which was €10.9 for the year ended December 31, 2018, €10.8 for the year
ended December 31, 2019, €9.5 for the year ended December 31, 2020, €10.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and €8.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
We calculate mobile ARPU by adding together, for each month in a given period, the total mobile-telephony revenues (excluding revenues generated by customers of other networks
roaming on our network and excluding wholesale revenues) for that particular month divided by the average number of mobile RGUs for that month and then dividing that sum by the
total number of months in the period.

(5) The figures for Vivacom’s blended cable ARPU included in the table above are calculated in line with our methodology. Therefore, such amounts can differ from Vivacom’s standalone
figures calculated as per their own methodology.


-----

_Nine months ended September 30, 2021 Compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2020_

_Slovenia Group segment. Blended cable ARPU in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased_
by 1% period on period to €35.5, mainly due to a price increase implemented in October 2020. Mobile
ARPU remained stable in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 at €10.9 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2020. DTH ARPU increased to €19.1 in the nine months ended September
30, 2021, from €18.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, mainly as the result of a price
increase in October 2020.

_Serbia Group segment. Blended cable ARPU in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 amounted_
to €20.5, representing a 1% period on period increase. The increase in blended cable ARPU was
primarily due to a price increase implemented in May 2021 for users without an activated e-bill. DTH
ARPU decreased to €9.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €10.1 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in DTH ARPU was primarily due to the impact of sales
promotions from the previous period.

_Bosnia Group segment. Blended cable ARPU in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 decreased_
by 2% period on period to €21.4, mainly due to the impact of sales promotions from the previous period.
DTH ARPU decreased to €8.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to €9.3 in the
nine months ended September 30, 2020, as the negative impact of sales promotions from the previous
period was offset the positive impact of price increases implemented in March 2020 and August 2021.

_Montenegro Group segment. Blended cable ARPU in the nine months ended September 30, 2021_
increased by 6.6% period on period to €19.7, mainly as a result of growth in the number of subscribers
for the multi-play offering. DTH ARPU decreased to €10.7 in the nine months ended September 30,
2021, from €11.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, mainly due to the higher number of
subscribers with expired discounts in the contract period.

_Croatia Group segment. Mobile ARPU in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased by 2%_
period on period to €12.3, mainly as a result of the expiration of discounted offers and a lower number
of extensions with discounts applied.

_Bulgaria Group segment. Blended cable ARPU in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased_
by 5.2% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020, to €9.7, mainly resulting from the
growing share of pay-TV tariffs with higher monthly recurring fees and additional packages, as well as

compared to €19.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, mainly due to the closure of B2B
businesses (mainly Bar/ Café) as a result of the implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns. During the
lockdown period, these businesses were not charged while remaining in the active base.

_________________________

- Figures for the Bulgaria Group segment, the Croatia Group segment and the Greece Group segment are for the periods
following completion of the acquisition of Vivacom on July 31, 2020, the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia on March 3, 2020
and the acquisition of Nova on November 12, 2020, respectively, until September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2021, as
applicable.

Slovenia Group segment. Revenue increased by €8.1 million, or 5%, to €185.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021, from €177.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to higher mobile revenues as a result of an increased number of
subscribers, price increases implemented in March and October 2020, one-off revenues due to the
reversal of provisions related to minority shareholders, higher mobile handset revenues and higher
internet revenues due to successful upselling and migration from legacy to EON packages with higher
internet ARPU.

Serbia Group segment. Revenue increased by €1.3 million, or 1%, to €170.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, from €169.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to increased video revenues driven by a price increase implemented in May
2021, increased B2B revenues compared to 2020, which was significantly affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, as well as successful cross-selling and upselling.

Bosnia Group segment. Revenue decreased by €0.4 million, or 1%, to €54.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, from €54.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
decrease was primarily due to the impact of sales promotions from the previous period on video and
internet services of €1.3 million and lower number of gross adds, partially offset by higher DTH video
and internet subscription revenues.

Bulgaria Group segment. Revenue increased by €313.8 million to €402.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, from €89.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Vivacom into our results following completion of its
acquisition by us on July 31, 2020, as well as the growth of mobile revenue resulting from a higher
share of packages with increased minutes and data traffic allowances. The overall increase was also
supported by fixed-line revenue growth in fixed-broadband and fixed-Pay-TV, which offset the decline
in fixed-voice revenue.

Croatia Group segment. Revenue increased by €24.2 million, or 21%, to €140.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021, from €116.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This increase is mainly due to the consolidation of Tele2 Croatia into our results following completion


-----

of its acquisition by us in March 2020, as well as a growth of our subscriber base in the mobile postpaid voice segment.

Media Group segment. Revenue increased by €101.5 million, or 95%, to €208.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021, from €106.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Nova BG into our results following completion
of its acquisition by us in January 2021. Total revenues of the Media Group segment (including
intercompany revenues) increased by 72% year-on-year, to €313.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, from €181.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Other segments. Revenue increased by €13.3 million, or 83%, to €29.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, from €16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to the launch of the Shoppster e-commerce platform in July 2020.

_Other income. Other income increased by €2.8 million, or 70%, to €6.8 million for the nine months_
ended September 30, 2021, from €4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

_Content costs. Content costs increased by €67.2 million, or 77%, to €154.2 million for the nine months_
ended September 30, 2021, from €87.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to the consolidation into our results of Nova and Nova BG, as well as the
content costs for events that were postponed from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Link and interconnection costs. Link and interconnection costs increased by €83.1 million to €134.3_
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €51.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to consolidation of Vivacom, Nova and Tele2
Croatia into our results.

_Cost of end-user equipment and other material costs. Cost of end-user equipment and other material_
costs increased by €51.7 million, or 56%, to €143.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021, from €92.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily
due to higher cost of sales for mobile handsets (mainly due to the acquisitions of Vivacom and Tele2
Croatia), the higher cost of end-user equipment, higher energy and fuel costs mainly as a result of
acquisitions, as well as higher costs of goods sold (mainly relating to goods sold by Shoppster, which
started operations in July 2020).

_Staff cost. Staff cost increased by €102.4 million to €186.2 million for the nine months ended September_
30, 2021, from €83.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was
primarily due to the increase in staff cost due to the higher number of employees resulting from
acquisitions in 2020 and 2021.

_Media buying. Media buying costs increased by €9.7 million, or 42%, to €32.6 million for the nine_
months ended September 30, 2021, from €22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to the Nova Acquisition and Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition,
which offset the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (that is, which led to lower media buying volumes
by Direct Media due to decreased overall advertising spend).

_Depreciation. Depreciation increased by €78.8 million, or 82%, to €175.2 million for the nine months_
ended September 30, 2021, from €96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to the addition of tangible assets as a result of the acquisitions in 2020 and
2021.

_Depreciation (right-of-use assets). Depreciation (rights-of-use assets) increased by €21.8 million, or_
81%, to €48.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €26.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions completed in
2020 and 2021.


-----

_Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by €146.9 million to_
€221.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €74.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets through
the acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2021.

_Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased by €84.4 million, or 70%, to €204.2_
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €119.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020. While all cost categories saw an increase, the largest increases were in
maintenance, license fee and marketing and promotion costs.

_Net finance costs. Net finance costs increased by €15.1 million, or 15%, to €117.4 million for the nine_
months ended September 30, 2021, from €102.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to higher interest expense related to new bond issuances.

_Loss before tax. Loss before tax increased by €28.5 million to €51.6 million for the nine months ended_
September 30, 2021, from €23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase
in loss before tax was primarily due to the impairment of contract assets from unbilled revenues and
higher net finance costs, which were partially offset by an increased operating profit.

_Income tax expense. Income tax expense slightly decreased to €10.3 million for the nine months ended_
September 30, 2021 from €10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

_UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by_
€236.8 million, or 83%, to €523.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €286.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact
of the acquisitions of Tele2 Croatia, Vivacom and Nova, which were completed in March 2020, July
2020 and November 2020, respectively, as well as the organic growth of our subscriber base, price
increases, continued successful cross-selling, migration of subscribers to multi-play packages and
effective cost discipline.

UG Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin decreased by 1% to 38% for the nine months ended September 30,
2021, from 39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the
contribution of our Croatia Group and Greece Group segments which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA
Margins as compared to our other segments, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_UG Adjusted EBITDAaL by Segment_

We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDAaL by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021,
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Slovenia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €5.2 million, or 9%, to €64.7 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €59.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the organic growth of fixed and mobile RGUs, price
increases in March 2020 (related to mobile services, and EON premium package) and October 2020
(related to both mobile and fixed services) as well as the acquisition of 12 thousand unique video
subscribers in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Serbia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL decreased by €0.3 million to €88.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €89.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2020. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of sales promotions from the previous period.

Bosnia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €2.9 million, or 17%, to €20.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €17.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to lower programming costs resulting from the non-renewal


-----

of our contract with Arenasport, which generated estimated cost savings of €3.9 million. This increase
was partly offset by the impact of sales promotions from the previous period.

Montenegro Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €0.6 million, or 30%, to €2.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €2.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to lower direct costs and lower operational costs,
while revenues remained at the same level.

Bulgaria Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €141.6 million to €176.6 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €35.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Vivacom into our results following
completion of its acquisition by us in July 2021. The increase was also driven by improved revenue
performance supported by a rationalization of our cost structure, which led to gross margin expansion
despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Croatia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €8.4 million, or 23%, to €44.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €35.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Tele2 Croatia into our results
following completion of its acquisition by us in March 2020, as well as growth of our subscriber base
in the mobile post-paid voice segment and a recovery in revenues from roaming customers.

Media Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €34.3 million, or 64%, to €88.1 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €53.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Nova BG in the Media Group segment
following completion of its acquisition in February 2021, which offset the negative effect from the
expiration of certain contracts for carriage fees in connection with the COVID 19 pandemic in the nine
months ended September 30, 2020.

_________________________

- Figures for the Bulgaria Group segment, the Croatia Group segment and the Greece Group segment are for the periods
following completion of the acquisition of Vivacom on July 31, 2020, the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia on March 3, 2020
and the acquisition of Nova on November 12, 2020, respectively, until December 31, 2020.

Slovenia Group segment. Revenue increased by €7.5 million, or 3%, to €237.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, from €229.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in internet revenues (a result of successful upselling and migration
from legacy to EON packages with higher internet ARPU), higher mobile revenues as a result of an
increased number of subscribers and price increases in March and October 2020 and higher mobile
handset and other revenues.

Serbia Group segment. Revenue increased by €3.7 million, or 2%, to €223.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €220.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to growth in the number of subscribers and multi- play packages, particularly through
successful cross-selling.

Bosnia Group segment. Revenue decreased by €0.2 million, to €72.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was
primarily due to the impact of sales promotions from the previous period, primarily in relation to video
and internet services.

Montenegro Group segment. Revenue decreased by €1.0 million, or 7%, to €13.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, from €14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was mainly due to a lower number of DTH subscribers in 2020.

Media Group segment. External revenue decreased by €26.2 million, or 14%, to €158.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020, from €185.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
decrease was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the advertising and media selling businesses.
Total revenues of the Media Group segment (including intercompany revenues) decreased by 5.3%
year-on-year to €267.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.


-----

_Content costs. Content costs increased by €6.3 million, or 5%, to €130.5 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2020, from €124.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the content costs of newly acquired channels.

_Link and interconnection costs. Link and interconnection costs increased by €53.4 million to €91.6_
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €38.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This increase was primarily due to higher mobile link and interconnection costs due to
acquisitions in the period.

_Cost of end-user equipment and other material cost. Material costs increased by €95.5 million to €145.8_
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €50.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This increase was primarily due to the higher cost of sales for mobile handsets (mainly due to the
acquisitions of Vivacom and Tele2 Croatia), higher cost of goods sold (mainly in relation to goods sold
by Shoppster, which started operations in 2020) and higher energy and fuel costs mainly as a result of
acquisitions.

_Staff cost. Staff cost increased by €32.7 million, or 32%, to €134.8 million for the year ended December_
31, 2020, from €102.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due
to the impact of additional staff costs from acquired companies. Staff costs in 2019 were impacted by a
one-time non-charge of €21.7 million resulting from the application of IFRS 2 in relation to a long-term
incentive scheme (LTIS).

_Media buying. Media buying costs decreased by €1.5 million, or 4%, to €38.2 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2020, from €39.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to generally lower advertising expenditures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Depreciation. Depreciation increased by €54.9 million, or 51%, to €161.7 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2020, from €106.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the acquisition of new tangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of Vivacom, Nova
and Tele2 Croatia.

_Depreciation (right-of-use assets). Depreciation (right-of-use assets) increased by €24.8 million to_
€42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €18.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Vivacom, Nova and Tele2 Croatia.

_Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by €61.0 million, or 74%,_
to €143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €82.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets of acquired
companies.

_Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased by €79.8 million, or 67%, to €199.2_
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €119.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This decrease was primarily due to higher legal and advisory fees (including related to
acquisition-related activities) and higher maintenance and license fee costs which mainly resulted from
the acquisitions of Vivacom, Nova and Tele2 Croatia.

_Net finance costs. Net finance costs increased by €28.7 million, or 28%, to €133.0 million for the year_
ended December 31, 2020, from €104.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to higher interest expense related to new bond issuances.

_Loss before tax. Loss before tax increased by €11.9 million, or 23%, to €64.5 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2020, from €52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to increased net finance costs, which more than offset the operating profit increase of
€16.9 million.


-----

_UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by_
€138.6 million, or 63%, to €434.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €295.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues as a
result of acquisitions completed in 2020, the organic growth of our subscribers, price increases,
continued cross-selling as well as effective cost discipline.

UG Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin decreased by 3% to 37% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from
40% for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of our Croatia, Greece and Bulgaria
Group segments having lower UG Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin as compared to our other segments, as
well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_UG Adjusted EBITDAaL by Segment_

We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDAaL by segment for the year ended December 31, 2020,
compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Slovenia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €5.7 million, or 8%, to €79.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to the organic growth of fixed and mobile RGUs and the price increase of mobile services
in March and October 2020 and fixed services in October 2020.

Serbia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €1.1 million, or 1%, to €118.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €116.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to higher revenues from the organic growth of our subscriber base through cross-selling
and strict cost control, which was partially offset by increased programming costs.

Bosnia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL decreased by €3.5 million, or 13%, to €22.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to higher programming costs resulting from the introduction of the new
channel Nova BH, with an annual cost of €2.5 million and increased costs for our Sportklub channels.
The increase in programming costs was partly offset by savings achieved on other operating expenses.

Montenegro Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL decreased by €0.7 million, or 22%, to €2.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €3.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, primarily due to a 7% decrease in revenues, which was only partially offset by decreased costs
and operating expenses.

Media Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL decreased by €5.6 million, or 7%, to €74.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to the decrease in total revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the
advertising and media selling businesses.

Slovenia Group segment. Revenue increased by €10.1 million, or 5%, to €229.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from €219.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to an increased number of mobile-telephony subscribers, increased mobile handset
sales and price increases in February 2019 in fixed-telephony.

Serbia Group segment. Revenue increased by €14.9 million, or 7%, to €220.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €205.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was


-----

primarily due to growth in the number of subscribers and RGUs (particularly through cross-selling) and
the implementation of a price increase in January 2019.

Bosnia Group segment. Revenue increased by €5.0 million, or 7%, to €72.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to organic growth, an increase in the number of subscribers for our multi-play offering
(digital TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony), and price increases in April 2019.

Montenegro Group segment. Revenue increased by €0.6 million, or 4%, to €14.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from €13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in the number of multi-play subscribers.

Media Group segment. Revenue increased by €76.1 million, or 70%, to €185.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from €109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in the number of multi-play subscribers and organic growth in both
carriage fees and advertising, and the contribution from the acquisitions of Direct Media in September
2018 and Nova TV.

_Other income. Other income decreased by €6.4 million, or 42%, to €8.9 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2019, from €15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was
primarily due to the divestment of Totalna TV Croatia in the first quarter of 2018.

_Content costs. Content costs increased by €20.9 million, or 20%, to €124.2 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2019, from €103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to United Media’s acquisitions of TV channels (Nova TV in Croatia, Bosnia &
Herzegovina and Montenegro) and increased sports rights costs.

_Link and interconnection costs. Link and interconnection costs decreased by €2.9 million, or 7%, to_
€38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €41.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower mobile link and interconnection costs.

_Cost of end-user equipment and other material cost. Material costs increased by €4.7 million, or 10%,_
to €50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €45.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the higher cost of sales for mobile handsets as a result of
increased sales volumes and higher energy and fuel costs.

_Staff cost. Staff cost increased by €3.1 million, or 3%, to €102.1 million for the year ended December_
31, 2019, from €99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due
to the impact of additional staff costs from acquired companies. Out of the total amount of staff cost in
the year ended December 31, 2019, €21.7 million related to the non-cash impact of the application of
IFRS 2 in relation to an LTIS and was the main driver of increased staff costs, as compared to €32.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On May 16, 2018, the shareholders of our former
ultimate holding company, Adria LuxCo S.à r.l. entered into the LTIS for the benefit of certain members
of our current and future management team. The LTIS consisted of a payment by the shareholders of
Adria LuxCo S.à r.l. following completion of an initial public offering or a sale of the Group. The
amount of the payment was calculated as a percentage of the proceeds received by the shareholders of
Adria LuxCo S.à r.l. and is based on the accumulated return on investment achieved by such
shareholders. In addition, the increase was due in part to our continued expansion, both organic and
through acquisitions, of the Group during 2018.

_Media buying. Media buying costs increased by €19.7 million, or 99%, to €39.7 million for the year_
ended December 31, 2019, from €20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to the full-year effect of the acquisition of Direct Media in September 2018.


-----

_Depreciation. Depreciation increased by €7.2 million, or 7%, to €106.8 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2019, from €99.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to the expansion of our cable and mobile networks, increased investment in own produced
content and new assets from acquisitions.

_Depreciation (right-of-use assets). Depreciation (right-of-use assets) was €18.0 million for the year_
ended December 31, 2019, compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was due to the
result of the implementation of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019.

_Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by €13.8 million, or 20%,_
to €82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €68.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased investments in programming rights and own
production, as well as the addition of intangible assets of acquired companies.

_Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased by €4.6 million, or 4%, to €119.4 million_
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This decrease was primarily due to the implementation of IFRS 16 and lower legal and advisory fees
related to M&A activities.

_Net finance costs. Net finance costs increased by €40.6 million, or 64%, to €104.3 million for the year_
ended December 31, 2019, from €63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to higher interest expenses and costs of an early redemption option that was exercised
in the January 2020.

_Loss before tax. Loss before tax increased by €9.6 million, or 22%, to €52.6 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2019, from €43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to increased finance costs.

_Income tax expense. Income tax expense increased by €4.4 million to €7.4 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2019, from €3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to a decrease in deferred tax as a consequence of the merger of SBB with IKOM and a
higher level of income tax expense.

_UG Adjusted EBITDAaL and UG Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by_
€34.9 million, or 13%, to €295.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €260.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues as a
result of the organic growth of our subscribers, price increases, continued cross-selling, effective cost
discipline, and the impact of acquisitions of Nova TV (Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro) and media
selling companies (Serbia) in the second half of 2018.

UG Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin decreased by 1% to 40% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
41% for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the impact of the Media Group segment
which had lower UG Adjusted EBITDA Margin in 2019 as compared to 2018, largely as a result of
acquisitions.

_UG Adjusted EBITDAaL by Segment_

We discuss below UG Adjusted EBITDAaL by segment for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

Slovenia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €2.7 million, or 4%, to €74.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €71.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to the organic growth of mobile RGUs and the price increase of mobile services in
December 2018 and fixed services in February 2019.


-----

Serbia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €3.9 million, or 3%, to €116.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to higher revenues from the organic growth of our subscriber base and a price increase in
January 2019, which was partially offset by increased programming costs and strict cost control.

Bosnia Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €3.0 million, or 13%, to €26.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to a revenue increase driven by price increases for subscriptions for the Bosnia Group’s
cable platform in April 2018 and April 2019 and satellite platform in January 2019, as well as an
increase in the number of subscribers with higher priced subscriptions.

Montenegro Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL decreased by €0.1 million, or 3%, to €3.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €3.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, primarily due to an increase in direct costs and operational expenses which offset the revenue
increase resulting from the organic growth of the subscriber base and the increase in the number of
multi-play subscribers.

Media Group segment. UG Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by €28.7 million, or 56%, to €80.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to the contribution of the acquisitions of Nova TV (Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro)
and media selling companies in Serbia in the second half of 2018, offset by organic growth in 2019 due
to increased carriage revenues.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of liquidity and funds for UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases,
acquisitions and other investments are operating cash flow, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
potential additional issuances of debt securities, ancillary and bilateral lending facilities and finance
leases. Our ability to generate cash from our operations will depend on our future operating
performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive,
market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

We maintain cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day requirements of our business. We hold
cash primarily in euros as well as Serbian dinars, Bosnian marks, Bulgarian levs and Croatian kuna.

Historically, we have relied primarily on our the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and bilateral bank
facilities, other debt facilities and cash flow from operations to provide funds required for investments
in UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases and operations.

As of September 30, 2021, we had €297.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately
€187 million we intend to utilize in respect of certain signed acquisitions and €8.7 million was restricted
for use and mainly refers to pledge agreements for the issuance of letters of guarantee in favor of third
parties.

As of September 30, 2021, we had €3,679.0 million of outstanding indebtedness (excluding lease
liabilities) on a historical basis. This included, as of September, 2021, €3,600.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Existing Notes (excluding transactions costs and fees related to the issuance
thereof) along with other financial liabilities related to bank secured loans of €74.4 million and finance
leases of €4.8 million. This amount excludes €279.6 million of lease liabilities, which would have been
considered operating leases prior to the adoption of IFRS 16. As of September 30, 2021, we had no
borrowings outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and our unsecured bilateral
revolving credit facility in Serbia. Following the Existing Revolving Credit Facility 2021 Increase, we
have €325.0 million of commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.


-----

On an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, including the use of proceeds from the
Offering and the other transactions described under “Summary—The Transactions,” “Use of Proceeds”
and “Capitalization,” as of September 30, 2021, the Company would have had €4,664 million of
outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis (excluding lease liabilities). The terms of the
Indentures permit (or, in the case as of the SSN Indenture, will permit) the Company and its restricted
subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of borrowings by the
Company or any of (in the case of the Indentures) its restricted subsidiaries under any Credit Facility
(as defined in the respective Indentures) of up to the greater of €570 million and 100% of Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the respective Indentures).

_Net cash from operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities increased by €199.0 million to_
a net cash inflow of €395.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from a net cash
inflow of €196.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily
due to the contribution of acquired companies, partially offset by increased interest payments.

_Net cash used in investing activities. Cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €521.4 million,_
or 41%, to a net cash outflow of €750.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from a
net cash outflow of €1,271.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was
primarily due to higher amount paid as consideration for the acquisition of Vivacom, Tele2 Croatia and
Nova in 2020, compared to the amount paid as consideration for the acquisition of Nova BG in 2021.

_Net cash from financing activities. Cash flow from financing activities decreased by €573.4 million, or_

cash inflow of €940.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was
primarily due to the issuance of the Existing 2026 FRNs, Existing 2026 SSNs and Existing 3.625%
2028 SSNs and proceeds from share premium from the contribution of the PIK Notes proceeds in
connection with the Vivacom Acquisition in 2020.

**UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure**

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases relates primarily to the purchase of property and
equipment, including expansion of our network in terms of capacity and new homes connected,
purchase of modems and set-top boxes to be installed in customer premises, growth in RGUs and
maintenance of our cable and mobile networks and infrastructure, purchase of intangible assets such as
content, software, investments in our core infrastructure and systems to facilitate the addition of new
services and acquisitions. Therefore, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases is primarily driven
by extending, upgrading and maintaining our cable and mobile networks, the installation and in home
wiring for new subscribers, the cost of cable modems, including high- speed modems for subscribers to
our high-speed broadband internet, and the acquisition of content. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure
after Leases has also historically included certain investments of a non-recurring nature, as well as costs
to integrate acquired businesses.

UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases also includes increases in intangible assets (except our
customer list and brand names) and does not include financial assets. As part of our strategy to focus
on UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases improving returns, we implemented measures to
ensure a more efficient usage of capital investment. We intend to manage UG Adjusted Capital
Expenditure after Leases to maintain our well invested asset base. UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure
after Leases excludes the impact of right-of-use asset additions and, starting from 2021, the right-ofuse asset modifications and prepayments. The members of our board of directors review all material
UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure programs.

For a further description of UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases, see “—Presentation of
_Financial Data—Capital Expenditure, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure and UG Adjusted Capital_
_Expenditure after Leases.”_

Over the next several years, we expect that UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases will be
largely success and capacity based. Success and capacity based UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after
Leases includes expenditures related to the expansion of our network footprint to additional homes and
existing subscribers, the replacement of set-top boxes, expanding network capacity, new product and
service development and expenditure incurred when connecting business subscribers to our network.
Success based UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases does not include expenditures for
maintenance, upgrade and replacement of our systems and infrastructure.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases
amounted to €398.1 million, compared to €177.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020
and included mainly investments in network expansion, customer premise equipment, as well as the
purchase of new programming rights and investments in mobile infrastructure and spectrum licenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, certain of our primary UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after
Leases items included: investments of €40.4 million on customer premise equipment; an investment of
€49.9 million on the build-up of our fixed network; investments of €61.7 million on development of
media, including acquisition of content and investment in TV equipment; investments of €34.9 million
on our mobile infrastructure; an investment of €10.7 million on our IT; investments of €15.9 million on
IP equipment; investments of €6.4 million on Video HE equipment; an investment of €7.7 million on
certain development costs, including €4.5 million with respect to United.Cloud; and an estimated €41.0
million for the integration of Vivacom; investments of €42.6 million on other capital expenditures, of
which acquisition costs represent €21.1 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, certain of our primary UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after
Leases items included: investments of €41.6 million on customer premise equipment; an investment of
€40.8 million on the build-up of our fixed network; investments of €44.1 million on development of


-----

media, including acquisition of content and investment in TV equipment; investments of €14.3 million
on our mobile infrastructure; investments of €12.0 million on customer acquisition; an investment of
€3.7 million on our IT; and an investment of €4.5 million on certain development costs, including with
respect to United.Cloud.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, certain of our primary UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after
Leases items included: investments of €37 million in customer premises equipment; an investment of
€42.9 million in the build-up of our network; investments of €10 million in mobile infrastructure; and
an investment of €3 million in United.Cloud. Out of our UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after Leases
for the year ended December 31, 2018, €5.5 million represented certain investments (€3.5 million for a
digitalization project in the city of Belgrade in Serbia and €2.0 million for the modernization of acquired
companies’ networks in Bosnia and Herzegovina).

For the year ending December 31, 2021, we estimate that our UG Adjusted Capital Expenditure after
Leases (excluding any amounts for Nova (estimated at €112.6 million), Nova BG (estimated at €6.6
million) and mobile frequencies (€93.8 million)) will be between approximately €372 million and €374
million, which we expect will include:

- an estimated €50.2 million on customer premise equipment (€40.4 million in 2020);

- an estimated €73.6 million on our fixed network (€49.9 million in 2020);

- an estimated €66.0 million on our mobile network (€34.9 million in 2020);

- an estimated €12.9 million on IT (€10.7 million in 2020);

- an estimated €18.9 million on IP equipment (€15.9 million in 2020);

- an estimated €6.6 million on Video HE equipment (an estimated €6.4 million in 2020)

- an estimated €6.7 million on development costs, including with respect to United.Cloud (€7.7
million in 2020);

- an estimated €66.2 million on development of media, including acquisition of content and
investment in TV equipment (€61.7 million in 2020); and

- an estimated €71.9 million on other capital expenditures (€42.6 million in 2020).

These estimates are budgeted amounts and may differ from our actual capital expenditure as our
business requirements change.

excluding the impact of the implementation of IFRS 16.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of September 30, 2021, we have issued certain guarantees to third parties in the amount of €10.8
million.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our income and cash flow from operations are affected by changes in market interest rates. Some items
on our balance sheet, such as long-term borrowings, loans to related parties issued at variable rates and
lease liabilities, are exposed to interest rate risk. Borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility and the Existing Floating Rate Notes bear interest at varying rates, and as a result we will have
interest risk with respect to this debt. Interest rate hedging arrangements are not in place as of the Issue
Date with respect to the debt under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility or the Existing Floating Rate
Notes. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt, but do not
impact earnings or cash flow.

**_Currency Risk_**

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are
denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or
obligation. As a result of our operations in various countries, we generate a significant portion of our
sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the euro. Our primary
exposure is to the Serbian dinar. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, 15% of our revenue
was denominated in Serbian dinars. The Bosnia and Herzegovinian mark and the Bulgarian lev are
pegged to the euro, while the Croatian kuna and North Macedonian dinar are relatively stable. Based
on our lack of any material change in exposure to the U.S. dollar in the nine months ended September
30, 2021, we did not enter into any additional currency hedge agreements during the nine months ended
September 30, 2021.

**_Translation Risk_**

Translation risk is the risk that the value in euro of the consolidated profit and loss statement and balance
sheet will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates connected with the translation of our
subsidiaries that do not have the euro as their functional currency. Almost all our indebtedness has been
denominated in euros.

**_Transaction Risk_**

Transaction risk is the risk of exchange losses incurred by us through purchases and sales in currencies
other than the local currency of the relevant subsidiaries.

Audited Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our
significant accounting policies and changes of accounting policies, including IFRS 16 (Leases), are

###### WIND HELLAS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

_The following review relates to Wind Hellas’ financial condition and results of operations as of and for_
_the periods discussed below. “Wind Hellas Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations” is based on the historical financial data included in this offering_
_memorandum and should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial Data,” “Summary of_
_Company Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate_
_and Certain Other Financial Data,” “Selected Company Historical Financial Data” and the Wind_
_Hellas Audited Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum. Prospective investors_
_should read the entire offering memorandum and not just rely on the information set out below. The_
_following discussion of Wind Hellas’ results of operations and financial condition contains forward-_
_looking statements. Wind Hellas’ actual results could differ materially from those that we discuss in_
_these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include_
_those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum, particularly under “Risk Factors”_
_and “Forward-looking Statements.”_

**Overview**

Wind Hellas is one of the three integrated communication providers in Greece with proprietary mobile
and fixed-line networks. It offers mobile and fixed-line telecommunication, high-speed internet services
and Pay-TV services under a unified brand and on a national basis to over 4.1 million subscribers.

Wind Hellas provides fixed-broadband and fixed-voice services, international roaming and value-added
services (“VAS”), and mobile internet services to both residential and business customers and to other
telecommunications operators through its LTE, HSPA and GSM technologies. Wind Hellas offers
unlimited data services to all customers, and its mobile offering includes pre-paid and post-paid mobile
services. As of September 30, 2021, household and business accounts represented approximately 61%
of total RGUs. Wind Hellas owns one of the three proprietary mobile networks in Greece and is the
third-largest mobile provider in Greece, with more than 3.4 million mobile subscribers as of September
30, 2021. It is also the third-largest fixed-line telephony provider. Its fixed-line offering includes fixedline telephony and broadband internet services, serving more than 0.6 million LLU & NGA subscribers
as of September 30, 2021. Wind Hellas benefits from an extensive nationwide fiber optic network of
approximately 6,162 kilometers (backbone and metropolitan access network) and approximately 600
kilometers of fiber as part of the recently commenced NGA deployment. As of September 30, 2021,
Wind Hellas also benefits from 328 points of presence in its LLU and RSS network with a coverage of
approximately 79% of active lines in Greece and full access to OTE’s last-mile at regulated terms. In
addition, Wind Hellas provides Pay-TV services to residential customers through its video platform,
Wind Vision, which it launched in April 2018 and had 0.1 million platform subscribers as of September
30, 2021.

Wind Hellas continuously invests in its network to support growth initiatives and enhance its service
offering. It also accelerated investments in digital service capability to take advantage of emerging
consumer behaviour patterns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, Wind Hellas
acquired 5G spectrum, which represented a significant milestone and laid the foundation for deploying
its 5G network roll-out while providing visibility on future license payments for seven years starting
from January 2024. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas achieved 4G and 5G network coverage of
98% and 24%, respectively, of the 10.7 million population in Greece and continued investing in its fiber
network, reaching 431 thousand NGA lines deployed.

Wind Hellas has successfully scaled in the market over the past few years, and its total revenue for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €558.3 million compared to €537.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020. Its WH Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021
was €248.5 million compared to €245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Going forward,
we believe Wind Hellas could leverage other growth opportunities to further improve its performance,


-----

including through offering fixed-mobile convergence bundles, expanding its fiber network and
introducing B2B services.

**Key Factors Affecting Wind Hellas’ Results of Operations**

**_Macroeconomic conditions in Greece_**

Wind Hellas operates exclusively in Greece, a market that has experienced substantial growth in recent
years primarily attributable to an improving economic and political environment. Since the general
elections on July 7, 2019, Greece has been benefiting from increased political stability. The government
is pursuing reforms and economic growth through infrastructure investments and the reduction of social
security costs and corporate tax rates. In 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant
effect on the Greek economy, prompting the country to take restrictive measures, curbing tourism and
transportation, and resulting in a decline in demand for products and services. In 2021, the Greek
economy is rebounding, supported by a return of private and capital spending and an increase in EU
funding. Greek’s real GDP increased by 1.9% in 2019, and despite a 8.2% decrease in 2020 due to the
lockdown and other restrictive measures imposed by the government in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, it is estimated to grow by 6.5% in 2021 (source: IMF), supported by critical macroeconomic
factors including, among others, a declining unemployment rate and increasing disposable income and
private consumption in the country. In particular, the unemployment rate in Greece, which has been
declining since 2013, is currently forecast to decline to 11.7% in 2026 from a peak of 27.5% in 2013
(source: IMF). The Greek market also remains relatively underpenetrated compared to other European
countries regarding mobile data usage, fixed-line NGA penetration and Pay-TV adoption. Greece is one
of the few markets in Europe with a merely nascent nationwide FttH network and no existing cable
infrastructure, representing significant market potential. The confluence of a favourable
macroeconomic environment, structural drivers of demand for telecommunications services and the
prospect of increased market penetration across the country creates an environment where Wind Hellas
can capitalize on further growth opportunities.

**_The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

In 2020, Wind Hellas’ results of operations were impacted by the unprecedented challenges presented
by the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictive measures implemented by the Greek government in
response thereto. The health and well-being of its employees and customers remained Wind Hellas’ top
priority throughout the pandemic, and strict social distancing measures were implemented promptly and
as needed. Work from home procedures were also introduced, where practicable, for both Wind Hellas
employees and call center agents. The successful implementation of these procedures was supported by
a well-functioning infrastructure, which evidenced Wind Hellas’ ability to manage its networks
remotely with minimal operational difficulty. At the same time, Wind Hellas seamlessly supported its
customers’ increased need for data and voice telecommunications, home entertainment and online
transactions, as well as the transition of many activities that are normally carried out in person to the
digital environment due to the nationwide lockdown measures implemented by the government. Despite
these measures, Wind stores remained mostly open throughout 2020 in accordance with government
guidelines, albeit operating with reduced employees and hours to perform essential functions and serve
customer needs that cannot be met online. This resulted in a collective drop in sales activity through
Wind stores of approximately 25%, which was counterbalanced by improved sales conversion rates
(i.e., the ratio between successful sales and customer visits at Wind stores), resulting in a 10% increase
in annual sales, which has kept Wind stores sales contribution at 70% of overall sales. Sales through
the stores’ network of Public were also negatively affected. For a significant portion of the year, retail
stores remained closed or were impacted by restrictive shopping measures, which resulted in a drop in
its sales contribution, which however was absorbed by sales via online channels.

With respect to customer care, Wind Hellas had to transition all its customer care agents from an onpremises to a work-from-home set-up. Despite this transition, Wind Hellas improved all the most
important customer care KPIs by introducing a flexible cooperation system between inbound customer


-----

care teams and outbound saving teams to handle call volume spikes using an organized system of sameday call-backs. Wind Hellas also benefited from its significant risk management experience acquired
during the decade-long economic crisis in Greece. In particular, it reintroduced procedures and control
systems that it had applied in the past to deal with capital controls, liquidity, collections and working
capital management. In addition, Wind Hellas has an experienced management team that is aware of
the relevant business continuity and corporate reputational risks in a time of crisis, who performed
thorough and frequent reviews of practices, policies and communications to mitigate risks. Wind Hellas
reviewed and managed operating expenses at regular intervals to scale its operations appropriately in
response to business demand. It also intensified the focus on cash flow generation by continuously
monitoring collections and implementing user-friendly remote payment options to facilitate customer
payments.

In the first nine months of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact Wind Hellas’ business,
although the effects were less pronounced than in 2020. Certain nationwide lockdown measures
imposed by the Greek government in late 2020 were gradually lifted since then including as a result of
the vaccination campaign. Specifically, in April 2021, the Greek government commenced a controlled
“unlocking” of the country’s economy with the reopening of high schools. This was followed by a
gradual easing of other restrictive measures throughout May and June 2021 and a partial relaxation of
travel restrictions. Although many of the restrictions have been lifted, which has led to a higher level of
economic activities, especially in the critical tourist sector, the situation remains uncertain, and specific
restrictions continue to remain in place in regions where the count of COVID-19 cases is higher,
including caps for on-site working and testing requirements. In connection with a renewed spike in
infections towards the end of the third quarter of 2021, the government is considering the
implementation of a series of new measures, including to incentivize vaccination. In 2020, Wind Hellas’
formulated a business continuity plan, which contemplated the possible scenarios related to COVID19, and this guided its response to each step of the Greek government unlocking of the economy in
2021. To counterbalance the decline in sales of its door-to-door sales channels in 2020, Wind Hellas
focused on strengthening its online sales capability, and as a result, its online pre-paid top-up revenue
increased by 24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with online top-ups (i.e., recharges
of pre-paid airtime made via the mobile app or website) comprising 27% of its total pre-paid recharge
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 22% and 15% in the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, Wind
Hellas’ Phygital channel was ramped up by expanding online campaigns on affiliated partners’ website
sites, to counterbalance the drop in sales of its door-to-door sales channels, which were negatively
impacted by the lockdown measures implemented in Greece. Digital and Phygital channels combined
accounted for 10% of Wind Hellas’ overall post-paid sales in the nine months ended September 30,
2021, compared to 5% and 3% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In
connection with the re-opening of Wind Hellas’ door-to-door channels following the ease of the
lockdown measures, Wind Hellas’ overall sales capacity increased compared to before the beginning
of the pandemic. Despite the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, Wind Hellas’ customer
base in its Consumer division increased by 1% to approximately 819 thousand customers as of
September 30, 2021 compared to approximately 808 thousand customers as of December 31, 2019.

Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected Wind Hellas’ operations and business
performance, decreasing demand in certain areas (mainly pre-paid services and business roaming),
reducing the number of visitors to Greece and affecting Wind Hellas’ ability to acquire new contract
customers. However, the pandemic also presented attractive opportunities to evolve Wind Hellas’
business model in response to changing consumer and business needs, and, for example, has
significantly accelerated its digital transformation plan. Wind Hellas continues to focus on mitigating
the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it remains vigilant in its efforts to protect the
health and well-being of its employees and customers. Wind Hellas’ implemented a rolling program to
allow its employees to continue to work from home as required, and currently, approximately 50% of
Wind Hellas employees are working remotely. For those who returned to the office, the use of masks is
mandatory in all public spaces, and the measuring of body temperature is performed before the
employees and visitors enter Wind Hellas’ premises. Following a €9.8 million decrease in revenue to


-----

€522.0 million in 2020 from €531.8 million in 2019, Wind Hellas’ revenue in the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, increased by €18.8 million to €411.9 million from €393.1 million in the same
period of 2020.

**_Mobile business_**

Wind Hellas’ mobile telecommunication services business has generated, and is expected to continue
to generate, the largest part of its revenue, accounting for 52%, 53% and 52% of its WH Service
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Revenue from mobile telecommunication services accounted for €270.5 million and
€267.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and €201.0 million and
€205.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The performance
of Wind Hellas’ mobile business is primarily dependent on the ARPU it achieves, the quality of its
network and its churn rates. Any changes to these elements could significantly impact Wind Hellas’
mobile business and overall results of operations.

_ARPU evolution_

Mobile outgoing ARPU remained stable for the years ended December 2019 and 2020 at €11.2, and
further increased to €11.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by increased
bundled and roaming revenues in post-paid and value-enhanced initiatives encouraging both usage and
spending in pre-paid.

_Improved network quality through Wind Hellas’ spectrum_

In the periods under review, Wind Hellas has made significant investments in its mobile network,
benefitting from high spectrum allocation per customer. The acquisition of sufficient spectrum has been
a key factor for Wind Hellas’ high customer satisfaction in recent years. The strategic acquisition of
spectrum has also allowed it to compete in the high-value segment of the sector and to monetize its
offerings, including its offerings that are targeted to benefit from the increasing demand for mobile data.
In December 2020, Wind Hellas acquired 5G spectrum, which represented a significant milestone and
laid the foundation for deploying its 5G network rollout while providing visibility on future license
payments for seven years starting from January 2024.

_Improved network reach through the Victus Joint Operation_

The Victus Joint Operation is a scheme through which Wind Hellas has efficiently and cost-effectively
improved and expanded its 2G, 3G and 4G networks. In 2019, Wind Hellas agreed to extend its 4G
network nationwide (including Attica), and this extension was completed in 2020 following regulatory
approval. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas estimates that its 5G network covered approximately
24%, its 4G network covered 98%, its 3G network covered 95% and its 2G network covered 99% of
the approximately 10.7 million population of Greece, and Wind Hellas has sufficiently addressed the
coverage gap compared to its competitors. For more information on the Victus Joint Operation, see
“Business—The Victus Joint Operation.”

_Consistent decline in churn rates_

Churn rate refers to the percentage of subscriber disconnections during a given time period, and it is
generally calculated by dividing the total number of subscriber disconnections for a given period by the
average number of subscribers for that same. Wind Hellas deems a pre-paid mobile subscriber to have
churned if it has not recharged its mobile credit for a full twelve-month period, its SIM card is
deactivated either upon its request or by Wind Hellas if fraudulent activity has occurred. Wind Hellas
deems a post-paid mobile subscriber to have churned when its SIM card is deactivated either upon its
request or by Wind Hellas if fraudulent activity has occurred. Wind Hellas deems a fixed-line subscriber
to have churned when its fixed-line connection is deactivated either upon its request or by Wind Hellas
if fraudulent activity has occurred. The figures for any period less than twelve months are annualized


-----

churn rates. Such annualized churn rates are calculated as the relevant churn rate multiplied by twelve
months and divided by such a period that is less than twelve months.

A lower churn rate increases visibility of Wind Hellas’ future revenues, indicates greater stability in its
customer base and decreases subscribers acquisition cost in the aggregate. Churn rate levels affect
various key performance indicators, including total subscribers and ARPU levels. Wind Hellas’ postpaid mobile churn rate decreased by 1% from 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to
10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The table below sets forth Wind Hellas’ annual
churn rate for the periods indicated.

**For the nine months ended**

**For the year ended December 31,** **September 30,**

**2019** **2020** **2020** **2021**


**Churn rate (on an annual basis)**

Post-paid mobile............................................... 13% 12% 11% 10%

Fixed-line ......................................................... 16% 13% 13% 12%

The decrease in post-paid mobile and fixed-line churn rates in the periods under review is due to
improved customer experience, improved network quality and network updates, convergent offerings
and targeted actions for upsell and cross-sell within the post-paid customer base. The decrease in fixedline churn is also the result of the decreasing number of customers switching to other competitors, as
evidenced by a reduction in total market portability volumes. Furthermore, Wind Hellas observed an
even lower churn rate for converged customers. Mobile pre-paid subscribers are not contractually bound
in the long-term to use Wind Hellas’ services and are free to move to other operators with more
attractive pricing or other advantages. For this reason, Wind Hellas does not consider pre-paid churn a
significant metric, but it rather monitors value return for pre-paid customers.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
churn rate for converged customers (i.e., consumer customers who have at least one mobile voice and
one LLU and NGA product under their tax number) based on number of accounts and excluding video
stood, respectively, at 7%, 8% and 10% for mobile an 9%, 9% and 12% for fixed-line customers. The
churn rate for converged customers, based on number of accounts and including video, for fixed-line
customers stood at 9%, 10% and 9% and for mobile and 7%, 8% and 7%, respectively, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

**_Fixed-line (including video platform) business_**

Wind Hellas’ fixed telecommunication services business, which include its video platform (i.e., Wind
Vision), generated 32%, 33% and 32% of its WH Service Revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue from fixed
telecommunication services accounted for €164.3 million and €169.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and €126.5 million and €128.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the strong
LLU and NGA fiber performance driven by customer base expansion and NGA fiber penetration, which
represented 44%, 36% and 23%, respectively, of Wind Hellas’ fixed base as of September 30, 2021 and
December 2020 and 2019, supported by cross-selling initiatives. Fixed-line (including Wind Vision)
ARPU declined by €0.1 million to €20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from
€21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Fixed-line (including Wind Vision)
ARPU increased by €0.1 million to €21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €20.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Wind Hellas’ LLU & NGA fiber base reached
approximately 646 thousand subscribers as of September 30, 2021 from 623 thousand subscribers as of
December 31, 2019, representing an overall growth of 4%, supported by NGA fiber base growth of
more than 100%. Wind Hellas’ fiber rollout plan in urban areas across Athens and rest of Greece has
been progressing rapidly, with approximately 351 thousand lines activated as of September 30, 2021
compared to approximately 264 thousand lines as of December 31, 2019. The churn rate in Wind Hellas’


-----

fixed-line product offering decreased on a year-on-year basis to 12% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 from 13% in the same period of 2020, and 13% and 16% in the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to household and
convergence strategy, and improved customer experience.

_Improvement of fixed-line network_

In recent years, Wind Hellas has made significant investments in its fixed-line network, focusing on
growing its NGA fiber platform. The rapid rollout of Wind Hellas’ fixed NGA fiber-based networks in
areas where it has exclusive rights boosts its higher-margin NGA subscribers. Wind Hellas has also
become more cost-efficient as LLU subscribers are on-boarded on its own NGA network, saving
approximately €7 per subscriber per month on LLU fees payable to OTE. Moreover, this provides Wind
Hellas with access to incremental revenue from leasing NGA lines to other operators like Vodafone and
OTE. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas had increased its NGA activated lines to 351 thousand,
and NGA penetration of its fixed-line broadband customer base had reached 44%. Wind Hellas’
wholesale revenues totaled €35.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, and Wind
Hellas expects it to continue to grow.

_Convergence strategy_

Wind Hellas’ position as one of the largest fixed-line telephony providers and the third-largest mobile
network operator in Greece, which has no major MVNO competition, enables it to offer a variety of
bundled service offerings of mobile and fixed-line telephony and broadband internet (ADSL/NGA
fiber), which provide customers the convenience of having a single provider for their
telecommunication needs. Wind Hellas believes this puts it at the forefront in terms of the number of
Consumer Converged Households in Greece. Bundling Wind Hellas’ services helps maximize revenue
from customers as the customers could have all of their telecommunication requirements serviced by
Wind Hellas, reducing the need for them to engage other service providers and hence the risk of losing
them to competitors. Wind Hellas’ focus on household offers is also further supported by its Pay-TV
offerings. As of September 30, 2021, the number of Consumer Households Converged accounts
amounted to approximately 273 thousand, representing a 18% increase from approximately 230
thousand accounts as of December 31, 2019. The bundling of services is now common in Greece and
promotes consolidation in the market, and Wind Hellas’ convergence strategy has allowed and will
continue to allow its mobile and fixed-line businesses to grow.

**_Cost reductions and efficiency measures_**

Wind Hellas continues to focus on cost reduction and efficiency measures to achieve higher margins.
WH Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin decreased to 24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021
from 29%, 27% and 27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This decrease was mainly due the impact of the Vantage Towers
Disposal. The calculation of WH Adjusted EBITDA Margin is set forth under “Summary of Company
_Historical and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain_
_Other Financial Data —Wind Hellas Other Financial Data.”_

Excluding the impact of the Vantage Towers Disposal as calculated in Wind Hellas’ management
accounts, Wind Hellas has reduced its operating costs primarily through rigorous cost monitoring,
ongoing digital transformation initiatives across sales and service, as well as headcount reduction
following organization efficiencies and automation initiatives with a direct effect on staff costs. The
Victus Joint Operation supports Wind Hellas’ network expansion by enabling a decrease in Wind
Hellas’ costs through joint cost-sharing arrangements. Wind Hellas’ fixed-line products also benefit
from further cost savings via its own deployment of FttC, as Wind Hellas’ fees to OTE are reduced
through the transition away from LLU, as well as via the FttC to FttH conversion that reduces access
fees. Wind Hellas also regularly renegotiates all third-party contracts in line with its strong focus on
operating expenditure rationalization.


-----

**_Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs_**

Wind Hellas’ primary subscriber acquisition and retention costs associated with post-paid subscribers
include: (i) commissions related to sales generated by agents, distributors and resellers (together
forming Wind Hellas’ indirect distribution channel) and (ii) the cost of handsets sold to its customers,
as handsets are typically sold to its subscribers for a price lower than their cost as an incentive for
customers to subscribe or renew their subscription. Wind Hellas’ increasing focus on direct distribution
channels and its converged product offering are therefore key factors for decreasing its subscriber
acquisition and retention costs.

**_Capital expenditure and license payments_**

Wind Hellas has made significant capital expenditures in growing and modernizing its network during
the periods under review. Wind Hellas’ capital expenditures (excluding capital expenditures for
spectrum license acquisitions and renewals) amounted to €58.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, and €89.9 million and €87.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Following the network sharing agreement with Vodafone Greece, the 5G licenses
acquisition, the ongoing rollout of Wind Hellas’ LTE network and the launch of its 5G network, Wind
Hellas is well-positioned to capitalize on the expected growth in data usage. Wind Hellas also continues
to invest in the rollout of IPTV network to improve the quality and scope of its offerings and to allow
for better customer experience. For more information on Wind Hellas’ capital expenditure, see “—
_Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures.”_

**_License payments_**

Wind Hellas renewed its three blocks of 2x5 MHz in the 1800 MHz band for a total amount of €59.1
million, €23.6 million of which (40% of the total amount) was paid on November 13, 2017 and the
remaining €35.5 million (60% of the total amount) will be paid with interest in five equal annual
instalments commencing on November 28, 2021. On February 23, 2017, Wind Hellas’ rights in the 24.5
GHz and 26.5 GHz spectrum were renewed for 15 years (from February 16, 2017 to February 15, 2032)
for a total amount of €1.0 million, €0.7 million of which (70% of the total amount) was paid in February
2017 and the remaining €0.3 million (30% of the total amount) will be paid with interest in equal annual
instalments which commenced on November 1, 2020. In addition, the 5G spectrum multi-band auction
took place in December 2020 and Wind Hellas secured strong spectrum position for a total amount of
€119.1 million (including the renewal of 2100 MHz license) €35.7 million of which (30% of the total
amount) was paid in December 2020 and the remaining €83.3 million (70% of the total amount) will be
paid with interest in equal annual instalments commencing on an annual basis from 2024 to 2032.

The table below shows current and prospective spending on spectrum licenses.

**Year ended December 31,**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, Wind Hellas has spectrum without the need for any
renewals for the next seven years. For risks relating to the acquisition of spectrum, see “Risk factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may be unable to secure spectrum in the future, which_
_would prevent or impair our plans or limit the need for our services and products.”_


-----

**_Seasonality_**

The performance of Wind Hellas’ mobile business is subject to seasonality, as revenue typically
increases in the third quarter of each year, driven by foreign visitors and other pre-paid customers that
travel to Greece for the summer. With tourism in Greece peaking in the summer months, 57% of Wind
Hellas’ annual revenue from roaming customers are generated in the third quarter of each year.
Following the lockdown measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of
Wind Hellas’ revenues generated in the third quarter of 2020 and 2021 from roaming customers has
increased to 69%. Domestic voice and data usage also typically peak during the summer months, leading
to an increase in pre-paid revenues (which are more driven by usage than post-paid revenues) of 9% in
the third quarter of each year compared to each of the other quarters. Furthermore, Wind Hellas
generally experiences cash inflows in the fourth quarter that are associated with the increased network
usage by tourists visiting Greece in the summer.

Wind Hellas’ fixed-line business is less affected by seasonality and it only experiences a small decrease
in revenue during August of each year due to certain portions of the Greek population going on vacation.

**Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Wind Hellas’ Results of Operations**

**_The Vantage Towers Disposal_**

On July 24, 2020, Wind Hellas Parent entered into an agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with
Vodafone Europe B.V. (“Vodafone”), fully owned by the Vodafone Group plc, for the contribution of
the Greek tower portfolios of both Wind Hellas and Vodafone into a jointly-owned entity. In November
2020, Wind Hellas transferred its tower portfolio in Greece to Crystal Almond Towers Single Member
S.A., a newly established subsidiary of Wind Hellas Parent. Wind Hellas also transferred a corporate
loan due by it to Wind Hellas Parent, amounting to €87.5 million, to Crystal Almond Tower Single
Member S.A. On December 18, 2020, a jointly owned entity of Wind Hellas and Vodafone was
incorporated under the name Vantage Towers S.A. (“Vantage Towers Greece”). Vantage Towers
Greece operates approximately 5,200 towers. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, on December
21, 2020, Wind Hellas Parent contributed its shares in Crystal Almond Towers Single Member S.A.
into Vantage Towers Greece in exchange for 38% for the issued share capital of Vantage Towers Greece
and an aggregate payment of €112.5 million from Vodafone effected by way of a cash payment of €25
million and a cash repayment of the €87.5 million corporate loan that had been transferred to Crystal
Almond Towers Single Member S.A. At the same time, on December 21, 2020, the parties executed a
sell-down sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”) and a shareholders’ agreement. By virtue of the selldown SPA, Vodafone received an option to acquire Wind Hellas Parent’s 38% share in Vantage Towers
Greece at any time up to December 31, 2021, which was triggered by the initial public offering of
Vantage Towers Europe, which up to then held the remaining 62% interest in Vantage Towers Greece.
The consideration upon exercise of the call option was €287.5 million, which, together with the
aggregate payment of €112.5 million made by Vodafone on December 21, 2020, brought the total value
received by Wind Hellas Parent for the transaction to €400.0 million.

As part of this transaction, on December 12, 2020, Wind Hellas and Crystal Almond Towers Single
Member S.A. signed a new long-term master services agreement (“MSA”), with an initial term of eight
years, which can be extended, subject to certain conditions, to a maximum of 32 years. On August 2,
2021, Crystal Almond Towers Single Member S.A. merged into Vantage Tower Greece. Under the
MSA, Vantage Towers Greece will be the preferred supplier of new towers for Wind Hellas and
Vodafone Greece, each of which has agreed to commit as an anchor tenant on 250 new sites (500 in
total) to be built by Vantage Towers Greece over five years starting from November 17, 2020.

As a result of these transactions, in November 2020, Wind Hellas derecognised a net liability of €64.0
million related to its tower portfolio in connection with its contribution to Vantage Towers Greece. In
December 2020, upon completion of the transaction contemplated in the Contribution Agreement, Wind
Hellas ceased to control its subsidiary Crystal Almond Towers S.A. As a result, a net gain of €377.0
million related to the transaction was recognised in Wind Hellas’ profit or loss and other comprehensive


-----

income statement, and the investment in Vantage Towers Greece was recorded as an “Investment held
for sale” of €310.0 million in the Wind Hellas’ consolidated statement of financial position. In March
2021, Vantage Towers Europe executed an initial public offering which triggered the call option granted
to it by Wind Hellas Parent pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and Vodafone acquired the 38%
share of Wind Hellas Parent in Vantage Towers Greece for a consideration of €287.5 million. The
transactions described above are collectively referred to herein as the “Vantage Towers Disposal.”

Following completion of the Vantage Towers Disposal, Crystal Almond Midco made a further €212.0
million distribution to Wind Hellas Parent in order to fund a capital return to its ultimate shareholders
of €210.0 million and payment of certain parent company expenses (the “Distribution”). As of
September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas Parent has no investment in Vantage Towers Greece.

After giving pro forma effect to the Vantage Towers Disposal as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020,
Wind Hellas’ WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage Towers Disposal for the year ended December
31, 2020 was €114.0 million compared to WH Adjusted EBITDAaL of €139.0 million, and its WH
Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage Towers Disposal Margin for the same period was 22% compared
to WH Adjusted EBITDAaL Margin of 27%. For a reconciliation of Net income gain/(loss) to WH
Adjusted EBITDAaL for the Vantage Towers Disposal, please see “Summary of Company Historical
_and Group Run-Rate, Wind Hellas Historical, Unaudited Pro Forma Rune-Rate and Certain Other_
_Financial Data —Wind Hellas Financial Data— Wind Hellas Other Financial Data—Wind Hellas_
_Adjusted Other Financial Information.”_

Through the Vantage Towers Disposal, Wind Hellas unlocked significant value in its infrastructure,
secured the long-term maintenance and development of its passive tower assets and at the same time
strengthened its active network sharing agreement with Vodafone Greece.

2020. This increase was primarily due to higher advertising expenses and higher equipment costs.


-----

Interconnection traffic, roaming and VAS costs slightly decreased by €0.1 million, or 0.2%, to €51.0
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €51.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020.

Maintenance, utilities and other services increased by €1.2 million, or 3%, to €47.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021, from €46.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to non-income related taxes and duties.

Outsourced costs increased by €13.8 million, or 58%, to €37.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, from €23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase
was primarily due to costs incurred by Wind Hellas under the existing MSA with Vantage Towers
Greece.

Rentals increased by €0.8 million, or 9%, to €9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021, from €9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily
due to higher expenses for circuits lines rentals, including from OTE.

Impairment of trade receivables decreased by €0.6 million, or 10%, to €5.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, from €6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
decrease was primarily due to the improvement in the trade receivables collection pattern.

_Personnel expenses. Personnel expenses decreased by €1.0 million, or 3%, to €28.3 million for the nine_
months ended September 30, 2021, from €29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This decrease was primarily due to staff cost efficiencies in relation to travel and car expenses.

_Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by €10.6 million, or 7%, to_
€165.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from €154.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the depreciation of the right-of-use
assets, which was partially offset by lower plant and machinery depreciation.

_Gain on loss of control of subsidiary. Gain on loss of control of subsidiary increased to €4.9 million for_
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

provisions of the sell-down SPA relating to the Vantage Towers Disposal.

_Operating profit. Operating profit decreased by €5.1 million, or 18%, to €23.0 million for the nine_
months ended September 30, 2021, from €28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
for the reasons described above.

_Net finance costs. Net finance cost increased by €6.1 million, or 18%, to €39.6 million for the nine_
months ended September 30, 2021, from €33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
This increase was primarily due to higher interest expense related to the right-of-use assets.

_Income tax benefit/(expense). Income tax benefit was €3.4 million for the nine months ended September_
30, 2021, as compared to an income tax benefit of €0.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. Wind Hellas’ effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was 21% as
compared to 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increased effective tax rate for
the nine months ended September 2021 is primarily due to the fact that in the prior period Wind Hellas
did not recognize deferred tax asset on tax losses incurred during such period.

_Net income gain/(loss). Net income loss was €13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,_
2021, as compared to a net income loss of €4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020,

**Total .............................................................................................................................** **531.8** **522.0** **(2)%**

Revenue from mobile telecommunication services decreased by €3.2 million, or 1%, to €267.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €270.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The
decrease was primarily due to the decrease in pre-paid revenue as a result of rechargers decline,
primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Revenue from fixed telecommunication services increased by €4.8 million, or 3%, to €169.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €164.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
increase was primarily due to the growth in the customer base driven by increased NGA penetration.

Wholesale revenues decreased by €3.6 million, or 9%, to €37.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 from €41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due
to a decline in voice transit performance and lower international roaming revenue primarily resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic.


-----

Revenue from interconnection traffic decreased by €4.5 million, or 13%, to €30.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from €34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to the impact of the new lower mobile termination rates that came into effect from
February 11, 2020, despite the increased traffic volumes due to higher post-paid subscriber base.

Revenue from sales of handsets and accessories decreased by €3.3 million, or 15%, to €17.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from €21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of terminals sold.

the year ended December 31, 2020 from €267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the
reasons described below.


-----

Interconnection traffic, roaming and VAS costs decreased by €11.1 million, or 14%, to €67.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €78.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interconnection traffic.

Commercial expenses and equipment costs decreased by €7.7 million, or 10%, to €68.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020, from €76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to the decrease in cost of goods sold and advertising costs due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Outsourced costs increased by €10.2 million, or 33%, to €41.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2020, from €31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the
increase in consulting costs relating to the Vantage Towers Disposal.

Rentals increased by €4.5 million, or 44%, to €14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
from €10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the increase
in wholesale NGA rentals and lease costs for capacity-related lines.

Impairment of trade receivables increased by €0.6 million, or 8%, to €8.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Maintenance, utilities and other services decreased by €3.6 million, or 6%, to €59.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, from €63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to lower maintenance costs as well as lower postal, transportation and utilities
expenses.

_Personnel expenses. Personnel expenses decreased by €1.7 million, or 4%, to €39.1 million for the year_
ended December 31, 2020, from €40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to increased staff cost efficiencies in travel and car expenses, and benefit costs due
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by €1.8 million, or 1%, to_
€208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €206.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation of increased right-of-use assets in 2020
compared to 2019, partially offset by lower plant and machinery depreciation for 2020 resulting from
the Vantage Towers Disposal.

_Gain on loss of control of subsidiary. Gain on loss of control of subsidiary was €376.8 million for the_
year ended December 31, 2020 and was nil for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was a result of
the net gain of €376.8 million from the completion of the Vantage Towers Disposal. See “—Key Factors
_Affecting Comparability of Wind Hellas’ Results of Operation—The Vantage Towers Disposal.”_

_Gain on disposal. Gain on disposal increased by €25 thousand, or 36%, to €95 thousand for the year_
ended December 31, 2020, from €70 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to the higher number of tangible assets disposed and sold in 2020 compared to 2019.

_Operating profit. Operating profit increased by €372.8 million to €406.5 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2020, from €33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons described
above.

_Net finance cost. Net finance costs decreased by €5.8 million, to €48.3 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2020, from €54.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due
to (i) the €8.3 million decrease in finance costs to €46.0 million in 2020, from €54.3 million in 2019,
which was primarily due to the lower interest expenses following the issuance of Wind Hellas Existing
Notes in October 2019 to refinance its previous senior secured notes, (ii) the increase €0.7 million


-----

increase in finance income to €1.0 million in 2020, from €0.3 million in 2019 due to the interest received
from Vantage Towers Greece in November and December 2020 on the previous intercompany loan
with Wind Hellas Parent which was partially offset by (iii) the €3.3 million loss on sale of equity
investments in 2020, compared to nil in 2019, representing costs recognized from the sale of Wind
Hellas’ shares in Nova (previously known as Forthnet S.A.).

_Income tax (expense)/benefit. Income tax expense was €10.5 million for the year ended December 31,_
2020, as compared to an income tax benefit of €3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
variation was primarily due to the derecognition of deferred tax assets of prior year's tax losses in 2020,
as compared to the recognition of deferred tax assets of prior year's tax losses in 2019.

_Net income gain/(loss). Net income gain was €347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as_
compared to a net income loss of €17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase
was mainly attributable to the net gain of €376.8 million from the recognition of the sale of 38% shares
in Vantage Towers Greece in 2021.

or 93%, to €5.8 million from €87.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was
primarily due to proceeds received from disposal of subsidiaries.

_Net cash used in financing activities_

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, net cash used in financing activities increased by €336.8
million to €364.1 million from €27.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This
increase was primarily due to higher dividend payments.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities slightly decreased by €1.9
million, or 3%, to €68.2 million from €70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**_Commitments and Contingencies_**

_Capital and other commitments_

Wind Hellas had a number of outstanding commitments on supplier contracts, which amounted to €11.7
million as of September 30, 2021, compared to €25.5 million as of December 31, 2020.

_Contingent liabilities_

_Litigation cases_

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas had recorded provisions for litigation of €1.2 million
(December 31, 2020: €1.2 million), which is Wind Hellas’ best estimate of the probable outflow of
resources that would be required to settle the obligations for the ultimate resolution of its pending legal
proceedings. For a description of significant outstanding legal proceedings, refer to Note 27 of the Wind
Hellas Audited Financial Statements and Note 28 of the Wind Hellas Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements.

_Letters of guarantee_


-----

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas had outstanding letters of bank guarantee amounting to €22.5
million (December 31, 2020: €25.3 million). These bank guarantees are provided in relation to large
projects or contracts and only come due if Wind Hellas does not fulfil its contractual obligations.

**_Off Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ off balance sheet arrangements include certain capital
commitments in the amount of €11.7 million.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk**

Unless otherwise specified, the following discussion with respect to quantitative and qualitative
disclosures about market risk relates to the Group. Wind Hellas has exposure to the following risks
from its use of financial instruments:

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to Wind Hellas if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from Wind Hellas’ receivables
from customers and cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the
maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**Wind Hellas**

**Year ended December 31,**

**2019** **2020**

**(in € million)**

Trade receivables, other receivables and contract assets ........................................ 107.7 94.5

Loan due from related parties ................................................................................. 9.7 9.9

Cash and cash equivalent ........................................................................................ 47.9 155.5

_Trade Receivables, other receivables and contract assets_

Wind Hellas’ exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer but is also affected by the demographics of its customer base, the default risk of the industry
and the competitiveness of the local markets in which customers operate. Wind Hellas’ customers
primarily include contract billing consumers and business subscribers, and receivables are due from
telephone operators and from the distribution network for the purchase of terminals, SIM cards and
scratch cards. 83% (2019: 72%) of amounts due from telephone operators as of December 31, 2020 was
attributable to three major national mobile and fixed telecommunication operators, which are also
suppliers to Wind Hellas, where payables due to these operators represented 69% (2019: 64%) of the
total trade payables due to telephone operators. 6% (2019: 8%) of Wind Hellas’ total revenues and 11%
(2019: 16%) of its total operating costs were attributable to interconnection revenues and costs
associated with these three operators. As of December 31, 2020, there was no other concentration of
credit risks relating to customers. Wind Hellas’ operations are only located in Greece. For a description
of Wind Hellas’ credit control policy, please refer to Note 29 of the Wind Hellas Audited Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Wind Hellas establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred and/or
expected losses in respect of trade receivables. For a description of the specific components of this
allowance, please refer to Note 29 of the Wind Hellas Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum. The age of trade receivables and the related allowance for impairment
losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 was as follows:

**Weighted**

**average**

**Gross** **Impairment** **Net** **loss rate** **Gross** **Impairment** **Net**

**2019** **2019** **2019** **2020** **2020** **2020** **2020**


-----

**(in € million, unless otherwise indicated)**

Not past due ........................................................ 54.1 (0.5) 53.6 0.9% 54.2 (0.5) 53.6

Past due from 0-30 days ..................................... 12.9 (0.5) 12.4 5.3% 9.6 (0.5) 9.1

Past due from 31-120 days ................................. 7.0 (1.4) 5.7 35.4% 4.4 (1.6) 2.8

Past due from 121-150 days ............................... 1.0 (0.5) 0.5 62.9% 0.8 (0.5) 0.3

Past due beyond 150 days ................................... 204.3 (196.7) 7.6 96.3% 201.1 (193.7) 7.4

**Total...................................................................** **279.2** **(199.4)** **79.9** **N/A** **270.0** **(196.8)** **73.3**

The allowance for impairment mainly relates to end-user consumers, which is based on the “expected
credit loss” model. The allowance for impairment of contract assets as at December 31, 2020 amounted
to €156.0 million (2019: €227.0 million), of which €87.0 million (2019: €150.0 million) related to noncurrent contract assets and €69.0 million (2019: €77.0 million) related to current contract assets. The
allowance for impairment has been shown as a deduction against contract assets.

_Loans due from related parties_

Loans due from related parties include a loan from Crystal Almond Midco to its parent company,
Crystal Almond Holdings Limited. The respective receivables will be recoverable through the future
cash flows of the operating subsidiary, Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. Therefore, the credit risk
relating to this loan is directly related to the credit risk of Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. The
loan is not overdue at the reporting date based on the loan agreement maturity date. No impairment
allowance has been recorded against this amount. Based on Wind Hellas management’s current
assessment and currently available information, as of September 30, 2021, there is no substantial change
in Wind Hellas’ credit rating that could trigger possible default events for the loan due from related
parties within twelve months from September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, the amount
outstanding under the existing intercompany loan between Crystal Almond Midco and Crystal Almond
Holdings Limited was €10.1 million, including accrued interest.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Wind Hellas held cash and cash equivalents as at September 30, 2021, including short-term time
deposits, of €142.1 million (as at September 30, 2020: €84.4 million), which represents its maximum
exposure to these assets. Wind Hellas limits its exposure to credit risk by investing excess funds only
in short -term time deposits

_Guarantees_

Wind Hellas’ policy is to provide financial guarantees only to related entities of the Crystal Almond
Midco. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas has provided a guarantee with respect to the Wind
Hellas Existing Notes.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that Wind Hellas will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated
with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Wind Hellas’
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity
to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation. Wind Hellas monitors its risk of risk of a
shortage of funds taking into account the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and
projected cash flows from operations.

**_Market Risk_**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices that will affect Wind Hellas’ income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

_Currency Risk_


-----

Wind Hellas is not exposed to significant currency risk through its sales, purchases or borrowings. All
sales and purchases are in euro, the functional currency of Wind Hellas’ operational subsidiary. All of
Wind Hellas’ interest-bearing liabilities are denominated in euro. The cash flow generated by Wind
Hellas’ underlying operations are primarily denominated in euro. Some of Wind Hellas’ roaming fees
are collected in a currency other than the euro, but such fees are not material. As of September 30, 2021,
Wind Hellas was not exposed to a significant currency risk, no sensitivity analysis has been prepared.

_Interest Rate Risk_

As of the reporting dates indicated below, the interest rate profile of Wind Hellas’ interest-bearing
financial instruments was:

**Carrying Amount**

**As at December 31,**

**2019** **2020**

**Fixed rate instruments** **(in € million)**

Financial assets .......................................................................................... 9.7 9.9

Financial liabilities ..................................................................................... (523.8) (600.4)

**Variable rate instruments**

Financial and other liabilities ..................................................................... (37.0) (121.4)

_Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments: Wind Hellas does not account for any fixed-_
rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore, a change in interest rates
at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss or equity.

_Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments: As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, a_
change of 100 basis points (“bp”) in Wind Hellas’ variable rate instrument would have the following
effect in Wind Hellas’ consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income:

**Impact on profit/(loss) before tax**

**100 bp - increase** **100 bp - decrease**

December 31, 2020 – variable rate instruments ..................... (387) 55

**Cash flow sensitivity .............................................................** **(387)** **55**

December 31, 2019 – variable rate instruments ..................... (107) 107

**Cash flow sensitivity .............................................................** **(107)** **107**

**Fair Values of Financial Instruments**

Wind Hellas classifies non-derivative financial assets into loans and receivables and equity investment
financial instruments. Wind Hellas classifies non-derivative financial liabilities as other financial
liabilities. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown
in the consolidated statement of financial position, are as follows:

**_Macro-Economic Overview_**

We operate most of our business across the following eight countries in Southeastern Europe: Bulgaria,
Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (“B&H”), Montenegro and North
Macedonia. These countries have a combined population of approximately 36 million people,
distributed across approximately 13 million households. Despite economic differences, these countries
share a joint history and form a single market in which small local differences are overshadowed by the
influence of similarities in cultural preferences and language across the region. As a result, this region
is one of the three largest markets in CEE, along with Poland and Romania. The following table provides
an overview of our countries of operations:

Over the past fifteen years, our eight countries of operations have implemented significant political and
economic reforms aimed at, among other things, reducing economic and structural imbalances,
increasing the flexibility of their respective economies (including liberalization of the media and
telecommunications sectors), and creating a business friendly environment that is conducive to foreign
investment. As a result of such reforms, Slovenia and Croatia were admitted to the European Union in
2004 and 2013, respectively. Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007 and Greece in 1981 (and
adopted the euro in 2001). Serbia officially applied for European Union membership in 2009, received
full candidate status in 2012 and in January 2014, the first accession negotiations took place.
Negotiations are ongoing with several Chapters having been opened up for discussion and review.
Montenegro was granted candidate status in 2010 and the accession negotiations started in June 2012.
North Macedonia has been a candidate for accession to the European Union since 2005, and in 2009
the European Commission recommended that accession negotiations be opened. Bosnia and
Herzegovina formally applied for EU membership in February 2016 and in December 2016 and has
received the accession questionnaire from the European Commission.

The macroeconomic environment is improving in our four core countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and
Slovenia). Real GDP growth in our four core countries is and will continue to be the key driver of
private consumption and disposable income growth.


-----

Bulgaria’s economy has experienced a slightly negative growth for the period from 2018 to 2020, with
real GDP decreasing by 0.2% from 2018 to 2020. However, real GDP per capita from 2018 to 2020
increased by 0.5%. Furthermore, in 2020, unemployment rate increased by 0.9 percentage points, driven
by COVID-19. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 0.1 percentage points.

In Greece, positive growth in disposable personal income is expected to continue, supported by
expanding employment, wage growth and a stable inflow of worker remittances. Unemployment rate
dropped by 0.9 percentage points in 2020. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 2.9
percentage points.

In Serbia, the growth in real GDP per capita is expected to continue, driven by monetary policy
relaxation, structural reforms and supported by expanding employment. Unemployment rate dropped
by 1.5 percentage points in 2020. From 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 3.8 percentage
points.

Growth is further driven by solid expansion in household spending as well as a trade surplus. Capacity
utilization levels in industry and services have reached their highest level since 2007 and conditions for
investment (e.g. high profits and low interest rates) remain favorable, which could potentially drive
capital spending growth. Higher than expected employment and rising disposable income has led to
healthy private consumption growth. Strong fiscal performance could support gradual reduction of
public debt as a share of GDP. Eurozone membership allows the country to benefit from the credibility
of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy and access to the Economic and Monetary Union’s
highly developed capital markets.

In Slovenia, the economy has been significantly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with real GDP and
real GDP per capita decreasing by 4.8 percentage points in 2020. However, the country has experienced
an increase in disposable personal income (+5.7% YoY in 2020). Unemployment rate increased by 0.6
percentage points in 2020, while from 2018 to 2020, the unemployment decreased by 0.1 percentage
points.

With respect to the currencies in our three core markets, Slovenia has been a member of the Eurozone
since 2007, the BAM is pegged to the Euro at a fixed exchange rate of BAM 1.9558 per €1.00 and the
Serbian dinar freely fluctuates against the Euro. The Serbian dinar depreciated against the Euro.
Historically, Serbian consumer price index (“CPI”) inflation has tended to more than offset depreciation
of the Serbian dinar against the Euro, leading to a constant “pass through” of the impact of the
depreciation of the dinar to the consumer.

We believe that our pricing strategy reflects the “pass through” principle outlined above. With respect
to the Croatian kuna, the long-time policy of the Croatian National Bank has been to keep the exchange
rate fluctuation of the kuna against the Euro within a relatively stable range.

###### Residential Segment (Fixed) 

 Pay-TV

_Overview_

The Pay-TV market in Southeastern Europe is characterized by relatively low service penetration rates
compared to certain countries in Western Europe, which we believe provides cable Pay-TV players with
attractive growth opportunities in the future.

**_Pay-TV Penetration Benchmark (% of Total Households), 2020_**

__________________________

Source: Ampere

Between 2018 and 2020, overall Pay-TV market penetration increased from 73% to 89% in Serbia, 76%
to 77% in Slovenia and stable at 68% in Bulgaria. This translated into substantial growth in subscribers
at CAGRs of 10.2% (from 1,781 thousand to 2,161 thousand), 1.0% (from 637 thousand to 650
thousand), (0.5%) (from 2,014 thousand to 1,993 thousand) and 7.6% (from 1,032 thousand to 1,195
thousand) during the corresponding period in Serbia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Greece, respectively.

The growth occurred primarily due to availability of increasingly attractive content, improving output
quality (mainly as a result of increasing digitalization rates), increased product functionality (e.g. video
on demand and CatchUp TV) and higher disposable income per household across the region.

The positive growth in the number of Pay-TV subscribers is expected to continue in Serbia and initiate
in Bulgaria, with estimated penetration rates in 2024 of 92% and 74%, respectively. The positive growth
in Serbia and Slovenia is expected to be driven by increasing demand for digital TV and other value
add services that can be delivered through digital TV platforms, such as VoD and CatchUp TV. While
the Greek Pay-TV market has been historically characterized by the lack of cable infrastructure and
preference for free-to-air TV, the number of Pay-TV subscribers is growing steadily driven primarily
by the demand for sports content, and is expected to achieve an estimated penetration rate of 34% in
2024.

- Cable

Cable Pay-TV is characterized by easy to use technology, quick installation of customer equipment and
reliability of signal delivered directly to the home. Population density is a key factor for cable operators
when deciding whether to invest in extending their existing cable network. A higher population density
reduces the overall cost associated with the deployment, operation and maintenance of cable
infrastructure and allows for mass marketing. Cable operators that operate in urban areas with high
population density benefit from easier access to customers and more cost effective network upgrades
and maintenance expenditures. As a result, cable networks in Southeastern Europe are mainly
concentrated across metropolitan regions in Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. As of December 2020,
approximately 26% of households in Bulgaria, approximately 56% in Serbia and approximately 39%
in Slovenia received their Pay-TV content via cable. The popularity of cable Pay-TV in Serbia is a result
of the attractive content available on cable television, the high service quality and the capability to
deliver interactive services such as VoD and CatchUp TV. There is only limited cable infrastructure in
Greece.

- IPTV

As a consequence of improvements in broadband internet technology, IPTV is increasingly being used
for the distribution of television services and has traditionally been the second most commonly used
distribution medium for television services across Southeastern Europe. In Slovenia, IPTV has recently


-----

become the most used distribution medium (56% of all households as of December 2020), supported
by EU investment in shared open fiber networks, which are accessible to all operators for a fee.
However, as these shared open fiber networks have been built with the objective of making high quality
services available in rural parts of Slovenia, these networks have traditionally had a limited impact on
our cable footprint, which typically covers urban and high population density areas. The principal
providers of IPTV are Telekom Slovenije and T2 in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija (who regularly offers
IPTV at a significant discount to attract subscribers) in Serbia, Bulsatcom in Bulgaria and Cosmote in
Greece.

- DTH-TV

DTH has traditionally been the third most commonly used distribution network medium for television
services in Southeastern Europe region after cable and IPTV. Pay-TV content owners can penetrate
rural areas more cost efficiently through DTH than through fixed line cable networks which are
economically unviable to develop because of low population density in rural areas. Satellite operators,
such as our own Total TV and competitors, such as Digi and Max TV, distribute digital signals via
satellite directly to television viewers. To receive DTH, viewers need a satellite dish and a set top box.
Depending on the service provider, viewers may also require a smart card for the subscription based
and premium television services distributed via satellite.

As of December 2020, approximately 46% and 67% of households in Bulgaria and Greece, respectively,
that had subscribed to Pay-TV services received their content via DTH, compared to approximately
16% in Serbia and approximately 5% in Slovenia. We believe that the majority of DTH Pay-TV
subscribers live in rural areas without access to a cable network, which limits the overlap between our
cable Pay-TV and DTH Pay-TV offerings.

- OTT

Another emerging technology is the delivery of television content “over-the-top” of an existing
broadband internet network, which allows Pay-TV distributors to reach customers through the internet.
We operate two of our own OTT content platforms: our regional OTT platform (which operates under
the EON brand of products and services) and our international OTT platform, NetTV Plus. Our regional
OTT platform offers customers of our broadband internet competitors within the region access to our
full digital Pay-TV channel offering. As a result, EON subscribers can watch all of our digital Pay-TV
channels on their TV screens, computers, tablets, mobiles or other internet enabled devices. Through
NetTV Plus, we deliver extensive local and regional content, to the entire former Yugoslav expatriate
community worldwide. Like EON, our subscribers can watch Net TV Plus directly on their TV screens,
computers, tablets, mobiles or other internet enabled devices. We are a leading provider of Pay-TV
services across our three core markets.

We mainly compete with local incumbents in our three core markets (Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia,
Telekom Srbija in Serbia and Bulsatcom in Bulgaria), Cosmote in Greece, as well as with other local
players (T2 in Slovenia, Telekom Srpske, HT Eronet and A1 Bulgaria in Bulgaria, among others). We
have managed to maintain our leadership and grow our market shares across our three core markets due
to high quality content offering, excellent customer care, positive brand perception and better value and
product propositions.

In Greece, Nova BG has been losing market share to other players, moving from 42% in 2017 to 26%
in 2020. As of 31 December 2020, Nova BG is the 2nd player in the Greek market, with Cosmote being
the clear leader with 48% market share.

###### Broadband

_Overview_

The broadband internet market in our core markets is characterized by continued growth and increasing
demand for high speed broadband internet services, which ultimately contributes to increasing internet
service penetration rates:

**_Broadband Penetration Rates (% of Total Households), 2020_**

Source: Ampere


-----

Fixed broadband internet household penetration rates in Bulgaria grew from approximately 65% in
2018 to 72% in 2020, in Serbia from approximately 59% in 2018 to 66% in 2020, in Slovenia from
approximately 73% in 2018 to 75% in 2020 and in Greece from approximately 100% in 2018 to 106%
in 2020. This translated into substantial growth in the number of subscribers at CAGRs of 5.3% (from
1,904 thousand to 2,113 thousand) in Bulgaria, 5.6% (from 1,447 thousand to 1,613 thousand) in Serbia,
2.2% (from 607 thousand to 634 thousand) in Slovenia and 3.3% (from 3,996 thousand to 4,263
thousand) in Greece during the same period. At the same time, fixed broadband penetration rates outside
of Greece lag behind the penetration rates of more developed European markets, such as France, UK
and the Netherlands.

We believe that the positive growth in the broadband internet market in our three core markets also
stems from the overall increasing importance of the internet as the primary communication medium of
choice as well as from a decrease in end user equipment costs, leading to increasing usage of personal
computers and smartphones. By 2024, broadband internet penetration rates are expected to reach 85%,
or 2,438 thousand, of households in Bulgaria, 78%, or 1,893 thousand, of households in Serbia, 79%,
or 677 thousand, of households in Slovenia and 112%, or 4,553 thousand, of households in Greece. As
data consumption demand grows in households, the penetration rate of high speed broadband (lines
capable of providing at least 30 Mbps) is expected to increase rapidly in Slovenia and Serbia in the
coming years. The Serbian “Strategy for the Development of Broadband and Networks and Service,”
adopted in 2014, established a target of 100% coverage with 30 Mbps by 2020 and 50% coverage for
100 Mpbs in an effort to align with EU targets.

- DSL


-----

DSL uses basic telephone infrastructure to access the internet. DSL technology leverages the fact that
copper wires used in telephone networks have a much higher bandwidth (7 MHz) than that required for
normal voice conversation (0 3.4 KHz). DSL utilizes the extra bandwidth to provide broadband internet
connections. The most commonly used variant of DSL is ADSL which assumes that internet users
normally receive or download significant more information than they would send or upload. Hence,
ADSL connections normally have three to four times more bandwidth for downloading. However, as
copper is a distance sensitive medium, access speeds for DSL technology decrease substantially as the
distance from DSL hubs increases. The maximum download speed of DSL networks has to be shared
between all services: television, broadband internet and telephony. Under currently available
technology, DSL based multi-play providers can therefore not provide broadband internet and television
services of comparable quality to those provided over cable networks. Another variant of DSL is VDSL,
a DSL technology that provides a faster data transfer rate than ADSL technologies. It is an access
technology that exploits the existing infrastructure of copper wires that were originally deployed for
traditional telephone service as a way of delivering very high speed internet access.

Historically, DSL has been distribution platform and accounted for approximately 7% of all internet
connections in Bulgaria, 37% in Serbia, 28% in Slovenia and 100% in Greece at the end of 2020.
However, its market share has been consistently eroded by upgraded cable networks which offer higher
quality service and higher speed as well as by the steady development of fiber based networks.

- Cable

Cable networks have been designed for the transmission of large amounts of analogue TV and radio
signals and are able to deliver consistent speeds irrespective of the distance to the customer, unlike
DSL. United Group companies are leading cable providers in the region with fully bi directional
network, largely EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled and offering up to 220 Mbps download speeds, with the
upgrade path up to 1.2 Gbps. Furthermore, the deployment of EuroDOCSIS 3.1 technology will allow
cable operators to provide data download speeds as high as 10 Gbps and data upload speeds as high as
2 Gbps over existing HFC lines (with full duplex EuroDOCSIS 3.1, upstream capacity will also be as
high as 10 Gbps). EuroDOCSIS 3.1 when deployed enables us to compete head on with fiber networks.
In addition to faster download and upload speeds, EuroDOCSIS 3.1 also offers other tangible benefits,
such as higher bandwidth capacity, better operational efficiencies, higher quality control, real time
performance analysis and lower costs. All these other tangible benefits should be available without
necessarily upgrading existing HFC networks or adding more fiber lines. EuroDOCSIS 3.1 is also
backward compatible with EuroDOCSIS 3.0, which allows us to roll out the new specifications
seamlessly, on an incremental basis.

In 2020, cable distribution accounted for 18%, 49% and 30% of all broadband infrastructure in Bulgaria,
Serbia and Slovenia, respectively. There is limited cable infrastructure in Greece.

- FttH

FttH is based on optical fiber cables and is the only infrastructure that offers similar speeds. Currently,
FttH broadband internet connections play a very limited role in Serbia. FttH had a broadband market
share in Slovenia of approximately 42% as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 36% in
2018. The main providers of FttH in Slovenia are Telekom Slovenije and T2. The increase in the FttH
broadband market share is primarily due to extensive fiber roll out by Telekom Slovenije and T2 in
2009, as well as EU investment in municipally owned open fiber networks. As fiber roll out is more
expensive than cable and the open fiber networks have traditionally been built with the objective of
making high speed broadband internet and IPTV services accessible in rural areas, we believe that any
competitive impact on cable operators will be limited, as these operators traditionally provide services
in more urban and high density areas (i.e. no overlap).

FttH is the technology of choice by United Group for greenfield expansion and new buildings in
adjacent areas.


-----

- Other Broadband Internet

We also compete with service providers that use other alternative technologies for broadband internet
access, such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as WiMax, universal mobile
telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and high speed packet access (“HSPA”). These mobile
broadband internet access technologies may allow both incumbent and new broadband internet access
providers the ability to provide high speed connection services for voice, data, video and television. We
estimate that only a small portion of households were using UMTS/HSPA for primary broadband
internet access via laptops or PCs in 2014. We believe that the majority of mobile broadband internet
users presently use mobile internet services to complement, rather than to replace, fixed line broadband
internet.

_Competition_

We are the leading provider of broadband services within our footprint with 22%, 33% and 29% of the
market share in Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia, respectively, as of 2020. We are also a strong challenger
in Greece with 12% of the market share in the country as of 2020:

**_Broadband Market Share Evolution (2017–2020)_**

Source: Ampere

Due to material overbuild in metropolitan areas in Slovenia, we face competition from other Slovenian
broadband internet providers, such as T2 and Telekom Slovenije who both offer FttH and, Telekom
Slovenije, Amis and T2 who each offer VDSL. In Serbia, we believe that cable overbuild is relatively
low and largely concentrated in Belgrade. The Serbian cable market remains relatively fragmented and
we believe that due to our scale in the market as well as our acquisition history, we are well positioned
to continue consolidating the Serbian cable market and thereby increasing our overall market share.
Similar to Serbia, cable overbuild is relatively low in Bosnia and Herzegovina (mainly in the Sarajevo
region) and our primary competitors are the incumbents in the ethnic regions in which we operate, BH
Telecom, Telekom Srpske and HT Eronet, as well as regional cable operators, who all offer multi-play
bundles at discounted prices. However, we believe we have a competitive advantage due to our
attractive content offering and high broadband internet speed. The Bosnian cable market remains
relatively fragmented and we also believe that we are well positioned in the market to continue
consolidating the Bosnian cable market and thereby increasing our overall market share.

###### Fixed Telephony

_Overview_


-----

Similar to the rest of Europe, fixed telephony penetration rates in our three core markets has been
decreasing recently and this trend is expected to continue, while fixed telephony penetration rate in
Greece is expected to remain flat:

_Technology_

We provide fixed line telephony services in Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovenia and Greece, using VoIP
telephony technology. VoIP technologies place and transmit telephone calls over the internet instead of
using the traditional PSTN. Following the liberalization of fixed line telephony markets in Serbia, all
telephony markets in our three core markets are now fully liberalized, providing us with significant
growth opportunities. Slovenia is one of the few European telephony markets in which VoIP technology
accounts for the majority of the fixed line telephony connections. We believe that this increase in VoIP
market share was primarily driven by lower prices of VoIP connections compared to PSTN connections
which are often offered as part of a competitively priced cable or FttH internet and television bundle.

_Competition_

Historically, the respective incumbent (Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija in Serbia) in
two of our three core markets, has been the largest provider of fixed line telephony in each respective
market. However, following the liberalization of the region’s telephony markets and the introduction of
VoIP technologies, which allows customers to make traditional fixed line telephone calls using a
standard telephone handset and provides comparable quality to PSTN at lower prices, the respective
Bulgarian, Serbian and Slovenian incumbents have generally lost market share to us. Nova has lost
fixed line telephony market share on the back of a wider broadband market share loss:

**_Fixed Line Market Share Evolution (2017-2020)_**

Source: Ampere

We believe that consumers increasingly select fixed line telephony providers by the quality of the
accompanying Pay-TV and broadband internet offerings or total bundle value, and we believe that cable
operators are well positioned to take advantage of this consumer preference. We offer attractive VoIP
packages in Slovenia which include free calls to all fixed phone subscribers within our network,
including to Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe this offering is particularly attractive
because a number of Slovenian residents have family in Serbia or Bosnia and Herzegovina who they
can reach at no additional charge through our packages. Since late 2012, we have become the second
largest provider of fixed line telephone services in Serbia, behind the incumbent Telekom Srbija.
Moreover, largely due to the introduction of full telephone number portability in April 2014, we have
significantly increased the number of our fixed line telephony subscribers in Serbia. We expect this
trend to continue. Similarly, in Bosnia and Herzegovina we offer VoIP telephony services as part of our
cable and television bundle.

###### Residential Segment (Mobile)

**_Mobile Penetration Rates (% of Total Population), 2020_**

__________________________

Source: Ampere

_Slovenian Mobile Market Overview_

Following our acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, we provide mobile telephony services in Slovenia
as an MNO. There were approximately 2.5 million mobile subscribers in Slovenia as of December 31,
2018, which resulted in a penetration rate of 119%, below the average mobile penetration rate in Europe.
The number of mobile subscribers in Slovenia grew at a CAGR of approximately 1.5% between 2014
and 2018. We believe mobile penetration in Slovenia is still below the penetration benchmarks provided
by certain developed mobile markets in Western Europe, such as Germany and Sweden, supporting
continued subscriber growth potential in the market. The Slovenian mobile market is a predominantly
contract (post-paid) market.

There has been a continuous decline in Slovenian mobile termination rates (“MTR”) since 2008. MTR
asymmetry in the Slovenian market was eliminated as of January 1, 2013, when MTR for all operators
became €0.0324 per minute. In July 2014, the Slovenian regulator, AKOS, announced a significant
reduction in MTRs to €0.0114 per minute and implemented this rate for all Slovenian operators with
effect from September 1, 2014. Following this reduction, Slovenian MTR was brought closer in line
with the target EU benchmark of €0.01 per minute, indicating limited further downside.

_Greek Mobile Market Overview_

As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 14.1 million mobile subscribers in Greece, which
resulted in a penetration rate of 135% and is above the average mobile penetration rate in Europe. The
number of mobile subscribers in Greece is expected to remain stable at a CAGR of approximately 0.1%
between 2020 and 2024. There are three mobile network operators in the Greek market; namely
Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind Hellas, with their own frequency allocation. Given the strong
competition, especially in the pre-paid mobile market, MVNOs have not been a major feature of the
Greek telecommunications market.

Greek mobile subscribers are well-positioned to benefit from pre-paid-to-post-paid conversion due to
the strong smartphone take-up, existing operational 5G commercial networks of each mobile network
operator and the well-saturated mobile market, which offers a future growth lever.

Following the implementation by the Greek regulator of measures to eliminate MTR asymmetry in
2018, there has been a continuous decline in Greek MTRs, with the rates stabilizing in 2013 at a level
close to EU averages. Greek MTR currently sits at €0.01 per minute, which is in line with the target EU
benchmark, indicating limited further downside.

_Licenses_

- Spectrum Licenses – Slovenia

The first ever spectrum auction in Slovenia was completed in April 2014 with the award of several
frequency bands to three mobile operators: Telekom Slovenije, Si.mobil (now A1) and Tušmobil
(Telemach Slovenia). Three of the four MNOs (T 2 did not participate) acquired the following bands:
A1 acquired total of 90 MHz on paired 800, 900, 1800 and 2600 MHz and a total of 45 MHz on unpaired
2100 and 2600 MHz; Telekom Slovenije acquired a total of 85 MHz on paired 800, 900, 1800 MHz
and a total of 25 MHz on unpaired 2600 MHz band, Telemach Slovenia acquired a paired spectrum of
5 MHz on 900, 10 MHz on 1800 as well as 10 MHz in the 800 MHz band which is widely recognized
as the most efficient band for 4G LTE roll out. The licenses were awarded for a long term tenure of 15
years which we believe represents a significant barrier to entry for a potential fifth MNO.

In July 2016, AKOS announced its decision to conduct an auction for various mobile spectrum bands
in Slovenia that remained unallocated. These included frequencies in the 1800 MHz band and the 2100
MHz band. AKOS set the reserve price at €2.6 million for each block of 2x5 MHz in the 1800 MHz


-----

frequency band, two blocks of which were available for auction, and €1.3 million for the block of
2x5MHz in the 2100 MHz band, one block of which was available for auction. On August 5, 2016, we
submitted our tender for these frequencies. On August 29, 2016, AKOS issued a decision in our favor
on the allocation of two blocks of 2x5 MHz in the 1800 MHz frequency band and one block of 2x5
MHz in the 2100 MHz frequency band for an aggregate amount of €6.6 million. Telemach Slovenia’s
license for the frequencies in the 1800 MHz band is valid through January 2031, and for the frequencies
in the 2100 MHz band is valid through September 2021. Telemach Slovenia currently possesses 60%
less spectrum compared to its main two competitors. In April 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum
licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G
3600 MHz in Slovenia in June 2021. We believe additional frequencies will be needed to be able to
address our growing mobile business, especially in the domain of mobile broadband.

- Spectrum Licenses – Bulgaria

On September 2020, we announced the commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria and, to that
end, in May 2021, we secured a 20-year license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band.

- Spectrum Licenses – Greece

The first ever spectrum auction in Greece was completed in 2011 with the award of technology-neutral
900MHz and 1,800 MHz frequency bands valid until September 29, 2027 and for 15 years, respectively,
to three mobile operators: Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind Hellas. Cosmote secured four blocks of
2x10MHz in the 900MHz band and two blocks of 2x10MHz in the 1,800MHz band; Vodafone secured
six blocks of 2x15MHz in the 900MHz band and two blocks of 2x10MHz in the 1,800MHz band; Wind
Hellas secured four blocks of 2x10MHz in the 900MHz band.

Further spectrum frequencies dedicated to 4G were auctioned in 2014 in the 800MHz and 2,600MHz
bands and consisted of 24 lots: Cosmote secured two blocks of 2x5MHz in the 800MHz band, six blocks
of 2x5MHz in the 2,600MHz band and two blocks of 10MHz in the 2,600MHz band; Vodafone secured
two blocks of 2x5MHz in the 800MHz band, six blocks of 2x5MHz in the 2,600MHz band and two
blocks of 10MHz in 2,600MHz band; Wind Hellas secured two blocks of 2x5MHz in the 800MHz band
and four blocks of 2x5MHz in the 2,600MHz band. The licenses were awarded for a long-term tenure
of 15 years.

In 2017, Vodafone and Wind Hellas renewed their 1,800MHz licenses for 17 years and Cosmote
renewed its license for 15 years.

In 2020, the Greek regulator opened applications for the 5G frequencies auction, with Wind Hellas,
Vodafone and Cosmote submitting their bids. Cosmote secured 15x5MHz in the 3.5GHz band,
2x10MHz in the 700MHz band, 2x20MHz in the 2,100MHz band and two packets of 26GHz band;
Vodafone secured 14x5MHz in the 3.5GHz band, 2x10MHz in the 700MHz band, 2x20MHz in the
2,100MHz band and two packets of 26Ghz band; Wind Hellas secured 10x5MHz in the 3.5GHz band,
2x10MHz in the 700MHz band, 2x20MHz in the 2,100MHz band and one packet of 26GHz band.

_Competition_

Telekom Slovenije is the largest mobile operator in the market, with a market share of 40% as of
December 31, 2020. Telemach Slovenia had a market share of 24% as of December 31, 2020. The
mobile markets in Bulgaria and Serbia are led by incumbents as well as mobile players that are part of
international groups. Historically, international groups have invested in mobile operations only in
Serbia, and we believe the limited focus of international groups in the rest of our core region is set to
continue, potentially offering interesting acquisition opportunities for us.

In Greece, Cosmote is the largest mobile operator in the market, with a market share of approximately
49% as of December 31, 2020. Vodafone and Wind Hellas each had a market share of approximately


-----

29% and 21%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Since 2017, Cosmote as the incumbent has been
strengthening its position in terms of market share at the expense of Vodafone and Wind Hellas.

###### Bundles

Customers in our three core markets increasingly seek to receive their multimedia and communications
services in a bundled offer from one provider. In response, service providers are providing television,
broadband internet and fixed line and mobile telephony services in bundled offerings; such bundled
offerings are marketed as the best value for money. We believe that bundled offerings allow media and
telecommunication service providers to better meet customers’ communication and entertainment
demands, increase average revenue per customer while also increasing customer loyalty and attract new
customers via an enhanced value proposition.

As of December 31, 2018, approximately 81% of unique fixed line customers are bundled customers in
Telemach Slovenia. Fixed and mobile convergence was approximately 43% as of December 31, 2018
with 1.9 SIMs per customer on average. As of December 31, 2018, SBB Serbia and Telemach BH had
bundle penetration of 80% and 74% respectively. While such convergence has occurred at a relatively
fast pace in a number of Western and Eastern European markets, notably in Slovenia, a series of
regulations, including those limiting alternative operators other than the incumbent service providers
from providing telephony services in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, have historically prevented
such convergence to occur in our three core markets. However, the relatively recent liberalization of
the Serbian and Bosnian fixed line telephony markets is accelerating the convergence in our three core
markets. The ability to bundle products and services plays an important role in our three core markets,
and we believe cable operators will be well positioned to benefit from this.

**_B2B Segment_**

Almost all businesses in our three core markets (Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia) have internet/broadband
connections. Large companies and small and medium enterprises can receive the following services


-----

from telecommunications companies: infrastructure and transport (dark fiber, wavelengths and
synchronous digital hierarchy), co-location, enterprise connectivity (including internet access, Ethernet
and multiprotocol label switching, virtual private network/wide area network, security and managed
services), hosting & cloud storage (including infrastructure as a service and platform as a service) and
voice.

According to Solon, business fixed data spending (which includes internet access (comprising
connection charges and monthly fees, excluding equipment costs), Ethernet (installation and monthly
services charges), internet protocol virtual private networks (costs of underlying broadband and
dedicated connections, excluding dial line rental and usage charges), very high bandwidth services
(upfront connection and monthly service charges on optical and dark fiber services) and legacy data
services (digital leased line, Frame Relay and asynchronous transfer mode connections)). We expect
the business fixed data spending to remain relatively stable. In more developed markets, additional
spending for co-location, hosting & cloud storage is typically around three times the amount of fixed
data spending.

**Media Overview**

Despite economic differences, the countries of Southeastern Europe have a joint history and form a
single media market in which local differences are compensated by the influence of similarities in
cultural preferences and language across the region. Television is by far the main source of news and
information in our three core markets. Through United Media, we play a significant role in this attractive
market and even offer our own content, including some of the region’s most popular sports, news,
children and general entertainment channels. We currently operate the most viewed channel in Croatia,
Nova TV which we believe enhances our media offering and strengthens our leadership position in
Croatia. In addition, in October 2018 we rebranded the Direct Media/Pink operations in Montenegro,
North Macedonia and Albania as well as its terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro as
Nova S in BH and Nova M to facilitate synergies with Nova TV in Croatia. In 2019, we launched Nova
S in Serbia, which although a Pay-TV channel, is structured as a full format national TV station with
attractive talk shows, sports and own production local fiction series in the market. Since January 2021,
we also operate Nova BG, the largest multi-media platform company in Bulgaria, which complements
Vivacom’s operation and consolidate our media leadership in the country. In Greece, we rebranded
Forthnet to Nova, refreshing its visual identity, and initiated a significant consolidation of the
entertainment and sports offerings.

_Overview and Technology_

Television in Slovenia was first introduced in 1958, with the launch of JRT RTV Ljubljana (now RTV
Slovenija) as the first TV station. Following the independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, the Mass
Media Act which was passed in 1994, laid out the specific model for the privatization of media in
Slovenia. The Mass Media Act was revised in 2001 and 2006 to define clear rules for ensuring media
pluralism. Today, TV market in Slovenia is operated by both state owned and for profit corporations
and is mainly shared between public service RTV Slovenia and private stations Kanal A and Pop TV.
Kanal A was the first commercial TV station which launched in 1991, followed by Pop TV which
launched in 1995.

Television in Serbia was first introduced in 1958 with state owned Television Belgrade, now known as
Radio Television of Serbia (“RTS”). The Serbian broadcasting system evolved from a public monopoly
into a dual system of public and private stations. The switch over from analogue to digital terrestrial
television in the country was completed in 2015.

Television in Bosnia and Herzegovina was first introduced in 1956 and since then, it has now developed
into a market with both private and public channels. Three public TV stations (BHT1, FTV and RTRS)
are operating within the Public Service Broadcasting system and are financed from radio and television


-----

fees. Together with private stations, as well as regional public stations, they form the national TV
market. The Pay-TV market is significantly fragmented with the majority of private TV stations being
locally focused. However, there are a number of players that aim to capture a wider audience throughout
the country (for example, N1 of Telemach BH). The process of TV digitalization is still ongoing in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Television in Croatia was first introduced in 1956 with Television Zagreb. Today there are four channels
with nationwide coverage. Digital video broadcasting terrestrial signal broadcasting was introduced in
2002, with the full digital switchover being completed by 2010 via gradual ceasing of analogue TV
throughout the country.

Television in Greece was first introduced in 1966 as a service of the National Radio Foundation (EIR).
Greece's switch from analogue to digital terrestrial television was completed in February 2015. As of
the date of this offering memorandum, the Greek television market is dominated by free-to-air DTT
offered by the key state-owned Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation and six private national TV channels.

**_Advertising_**

Across our three core markets, television is the medium of choice for advertising, accounting for
approximately 50% of total advertising spent. The internet, as a medium of choice for advertising, is
expected to grow at higher rates than television, but will still remain below television in coming years.
The average daily viewing time across the three core markets ranges from approximately 3.5 to 5.5
hours demonstrating the importance of TV as medium for information and entertainment. Most
importantly, the demand for TV is relatively inelastic. TV continues to offer a unique proposition to
advertisers: enormous scale, fast reach, very high quality advertisement inventory and an attractive
contextual environment for brand building. As a result, TV advertising should continue to be resilient,
with any gradual volume reductions more than offset by price inflation.

Television broadcasting in each of our markets is regulated by a governmental authority or agency. For
example, privately owned broadcasters in Slovenia are allowed to broadcast advertising for up to 12
minutes in any hour, whereas the public broadcaster, Radiotelevizija Slovenija, is allowed to broadcast
advertising for up to 10 minutes per hour given the additional financing from TV licensing fees.
Between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., the advertising time limit is reduced to seven minutes
for the public broadcaster. In Serbia, advertising time is regulated on an hourly and daily basis, where
commercial broadcasters are restricted to 20% of the daily broadcasts and to 20% per hour of
broadcasting. Similarly to Slovenia, in Croatia the permitted advertising time per hour is 12 minutes
with no daily limit and direct sales advertising must be at least 15 minutes.

The advertising markets in Southeastern Europe have benefitted from robust macro-economic
conditions. Advertising spend in our core three countries (Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina) is expected to grow faster than real GDP, with TV channel advertising remaining resilient.
The recent decline of advertising spend in Croatia resulted from bankruptcy of one of Croatia’s biggest
company, Agrokor, which employed approximately 60 thousand total staff members and its revenues
accounted for more than 15% of Croatia’s total GDP.

The Direct Media/Pink Acquisition, completed in September 2018, focuses on targeted advertising and
specialized Pay-TV and positions us at the forefront of digital advertising in the region. As a result, we
acquired the know-how of more than 100 of the best professionals in the region who provide significant
synergies with the broader operations of the Group.

###### OUR BUSINESS

**Our Business Overview**

We are the leading telecommunications player in Southeastern Europe, with a unique media ecosystem
to complement our regional distribution capabilities. As of September 30, 2021, we provided services
to approximately 15.2 million RGUs and covered approximately 4.3 million homes passed after giving
effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition and other signed acquisitions. We offer a diverse and
differentiated line of products and services and are the clear multi-play leader in our footprint across
Slovenia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, with an
addressable market that comprised 13.4 million households as of September 30, 2021. We also produce
and distribute distinctive and attractive content for our Pay-TV channels across a wide range of media
formats. The Group’s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was €1,383.9 million,
and the UG Adjusted EBITDAaL for such period was €523.4 million. The Pro forma Group had RunRate Revenue for the annualized last two quarters ended September 30, 2021 of €2,536.2 million and
Pro forma Run-Rate Last Two Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDAaL for September 30, 2021 was
€969.0 million.

We have grown rapidly through both value-accretive acquisitions and organic growth. In August 2021,
we signed an agreement to acquire Wind Hellas, a leading integrated telecommunications operator and
the number three mobile-telephony services provider in Greece, furthering our penetration into the
Greek market following our acquisition of Nova (formerly Forthnet S.A.) in 2020. After giving effect
to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, approximately 1/3 of our pro forma revenues for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 would have been derived in Greece. We have also made a number of smaller
acquisitions in Bulgaria, building on our leading positions following completion of the Vivacom
Acquisition in 2020 and the acquisition of Nova BG in 2021, and in Croatia, where we acquired Tele2
Croatia in 2020 and we have signed an agreement to acquire Optima Telekom in 2021. We have also
continued to expand our in-house media and content offering through acquisitions, with a focus on
expansion in euro or euro-pegged currency jurisdictions. We have significantly improved our business
profile in terms of scale, geographic exposure and currency mix and product diversification.


-----

We are a leading player in Pay-TV, broadband, fixed telephony and mobile telephony across the
jurisdictions in which we operate, as shown below:

___________________________

Source: Company information.
(1) Market position is based on total subscribers.

(2) We are the leading high-speed cable broadband internet provider in each of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria
within our footprint, overall leading provider in Slovenia within our footprint and out-of-footprint, and we have the second-largest
broadband and telephony market share in each of these countries, behind the respective incumbents with national footprints. In
Bulgaria, following the acquisition of Vivacom, we have the largest broadband and fixed-line telephony market share.

(3) Company Footprint RGUs consist of Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony Company RGUs.

(4) Company DTH RGUs in Slovenia include Company RGUs for DTH services provided in Slovenia and internationally, pre-paid
DTH services and Pink International (which distributes Pink channels in Western Europe) and DTH North Macedonia.

(5) Based on aggregated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (including Wind Hellas’ and Optima Telekom’s
revenues for the period), United Group’s Media Group’s external revenue represented 12% of our total aggregated revenue for the
same period; figures for Nova BG for the period prior to its acquisition by us are based on management accounts.

(6) This figure includes 1.9 million homes passed through Vivacom’s FTTP / VDSL network. Nova uses OTE’s wholesale Local Loop
Unbundling (LLU) and Bitstream services for its fixed network access across Greece; pro forma for the Wind Hellas.

(7) Most Cable RGUs for Nova represent broadband and fixed-telephony. Customers of Nova are serviced through a local loop
unbundling arrangement with the incumbent OTE.

Our in-house content business produces distinctive and attractive content for our Pay-TV channels and
has historically driven Pay-TV subscriptions. We currently produce over 50% of the total content in our
national (terrestrial) and most of our Pay-TV operations, and our main prime-time programs typically
receive ratings of between 20% and 50% in the markets in which they are available. As part of our
media business, we also provide advertising services and digital production and distribution in our
markets. We are also a distribution partner of choice for premium regional and international content
owners because of our well-known brands, large network and our focus on Southeastern Europe.

Our core telecommunications business is complemented by our two OTT distribution platforms that
customers can access through internet-based streaming: (i) EON, our regional OTT platform in
Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Greece, which enables customers connected to our
competitors’ broadband internet connections outside of our cable footprint to access our attractive
portfolio of Pay-TV channels; and (ii) NetTV Plus, our international OTT platform, which delivers
ethnic and local language content to the ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. In July 2020, we
launched Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online shopping platform, which offers more than 20


-----

popular product categories, and is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia
and Slovenia.

We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain and grow our market-leading positions, as we
provide a well-invested network, some of the fastest download speeds, access to desirable media content
and high-quality customer service, all of which has led to relatively low churn rates and high customer
loyalty. Our customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their
everyday lives, which results in recurring, high demand and makes our business more resilient to macroeconomic disruptions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic where we saw data and voice traffic
increase.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_We operate in structurally attractive markets._**

We operate in countries across Southeastern Europe that are attractive telecommunication markets due
to favourable competitive dynamics, relatively low penetration of broadband and Pay-TV, and a
predictable regulatory environment. Our countries of operation have also generally experienced
stronger real GDP growth than the Eurozone average in recent years. Most recently, in 2021, real GDP
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia grew by 5.7%
on average compared to 5.0% on average in the Eurozone. In addition, real GDP in these countries is
currently estimated to grow at an average of 2.9% by 2025, which is higher than the average estimated
growth of 1.4% in the Eurozone (source: IMF).

After completing the Wind Hellas Acquisition, across most of our footprint, there are only one to two
other companies in each of the countries where we are present that own and operate the majority of the
broadband infrastructure. While in some of our markets a few small players own their broadband
network, we have competitive advantages over them given our nationwide presence and the benefits of
scale that we enjoy as nationwide network operators. Within the four major geographies where we offer
mobile-telephony, with the exception of Slovenia, there are only three MNOs in each country. The
presence of fewer players owning broadband and mobile networks within a single competitive
environment typically results in healthy competition in the retail market which leads to profitable
investments.

The countries in which we operate are characterized by growing Pay-TV and broadband markets that
are currently underpenetrated relative to some other CEE and Western European markets and therefore
present an attractive structural growth proposition. Between 2018 and 2020, fixed broadband internet
household penetration rates increased from approximately 65% to 72% in Bulgaria, from approximately
59% to 66% in Serbia, from approximately 73% to 75% in Slovenia and from approximately 100% to
106% in Greece. Over the same period, overall Pay-TV market penetration rates increased from
approximately 73% to 89% in Serbia and from approximately 76% to 77% in Slovenia, and remained
stable at approximately 68% in Bulgaria. As a result, over the past few years we have experienced a
steady growth in the number of subscribers across our markets and we expect our subscriber base to
grow further over the next couple of years. Subscribers are increasingly upgrading to higher speed
broadband offerings due to a variety of factors including, among others, the increase in remote working
and continued growth in high bandwidth applications.

The national telecommunication framework in each of our countries of operation is overseen by
competent national regulatory authorities. As members of the EU, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia and
Croatia which together account for than 3/4 of our revenues after giving effect to the Wind Hellas
Acquisition, have national regulatory frameworks that align with EU guidelines and directives, which
provides for a relatively stable regulatory environment.

**_We are the leading integrated multi-play provider across Southeastern Europe._**


-----

We are the leading integrated multi-play provider in Southeastern Europe based on market share by
number of subscribers, a position that we have reinforced through acquisitions we have made which
have allowed us to expand geographically, diversify our business and increase our customer base. Our
leadership position in the region will be further strengthened following the completion of the Wind
Hellas Acquisition, which will add 3.4 million RGUs as of September 30, 2021. In addition, the
Vivacom Acquisition has increased our addressable market by 35%. Our scale and presence across
Southeastern Europe and across our product portfolios allows us to cross-sell our services and expand
the number of multi-play packages we provide, creating opportunities to further expand our customer
base and continue to strengthen our leadership position in the region.

In the Pay-TV market, we have leveraged our complementary cable and DTH platforms to gain leading
market shares in Southeastern Europe and become the pan regional leader with 2.1 million unique
subscribers as of September 30, 2021. In particular, we are the leading Pay-TV provider in each of
Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with market shares of 45%, 39% and 40%, respectively,
as of September 30, 2021, each based on number of subscribers; and we are the second largest Pay-TV
operator in Greece, with a market share of 27% as of September 30, 2021, and the largest in Bulgaria,
with a market share of 27% as of September 30, 2021, each based on number of subscribers. In addition,
we are the largest DTH Pay-TV provider in Montenegro and are among the main providers of DTH
Pay-TV in North Macedonia and Croatia. Among high-speed cable broadband internet providers, we
are the leader in each of Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina within our footprint and have a
large broadband market share overall, behind only the respective incumbents with national footprints.
We are also the leading provider of broadband internet by number of subscribers in Bulgaria. In
addition, we are the market leader in fixed-line telephony in Bulgaria and the second-largest fixed-line
telephony provider in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In mobile-telephony, we are the
third largest MNO in each of Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and, after giving effect to the Wind Hellas
Acquisition, Greece, with market shares based on the number of subscribers of, respectively,
approximately 24% as of June 30, 2021, 29% as of December 31, 2020, and 19% and 24% as of
September 30, 2021.

**_We are a recognized media leader benefitting from content ownership, own production and strategic_**
**_partnerships._**

We believe we are the recognized media leader in Southeastern Europe, offering fully integrated
production and distribution of attractive and distinctive local content for the entire region, which has a
population of approximately 40 million, with similar languages, cultures and entertainment preferences.
Our focus on the entire Southeastern European region allows us to maintain and serve some of the
smaller markets where smaller operators are less able to provide first rate localized content on an
economically efficient basis. At the same time, we believe international players would find it difficult
and costly to expand into the region, due to language and cultural barriers.

Through our owned-content business we directly own many of the region’s popular pay-TV channels.
In addition, as of September 30, 2021, we produced 50% of our content locally. Owning our content
allows us to control the end-to-end creation process, produce a wide range of diversified and attractive
local and genre specific content and maintain a structural hedge on content costs. Our in-house
production has significantly increased over recent years, and the content offered has continuously
improved. In addition, we have established a digital music production and content distribution business,
and have leading full format TV stations with appealing content in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Montenegro. In March 2019, we launched Nova S in Serbia, Total TV and EON. Following the
Nova Acquisition in November 2020, we also offer content under EON-branded channels in Greece,
and in January 2021, we acquired Nova Broadcasting Group, Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media
company, becoming a major content player in Bulgaria.

In addition to our owned content offerings, our pay-TV distribution platforms typically license the rights
for the distribution of our own channels, as well as third-party owned channels. We believe that our pan
regional presence, large subscriber base, advanced network, cable and DTH platforms, leading market


-----

positions and relationships with all major third-party distribution platforms make us an attractive partner
to third-party content owners, including major sporting leagues (such as the World Cup qualifiers and
the League of Nations). As a result, we are able to enter into strategic partnerships with third-party
contract providers to distribute their content to the entire region on attractive terms, whereas competitors
operating in a single country within the region cannot offer similarly broad coverage. We are also able
to offer our content partners value added services such as subtitles for television shows and can spread
the costs across our operations in the entire region, whereas we believe such costs would not be
economically justifiable for a competitor operating within a single country in the region. The table
below highlights our differentiated media offering:

**_We have well-diversified revenue streams by segment, product and geography, and 85% of revenues_**
**_are in euro or pegged to the euro._**

Due to our leading market positions across Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Montenegro, and our position as a pan regional services provider, our business
benefits from geographically-diversified and product portfolio-diversified revenue streams, which was
further increased following the Wind Hellas Acquisition. In terms of geographic diversity, the chart
below presents the percentage of revenue derived by jurisdiction (as a percentage of gross revenue,
excluding intercompany revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, both before and after
giving effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition, the Optima Telekom Acquisition, the Nova Broadcasting
Group Acquisition and other smaller acquisitions:

figures for Nova BG, Danas, Vesnik Telegraf, Net1, N3, D-Express, Mainstream (IT4BIZ d.o.o.), Networx and
Tessa Energy for the period prior to their acquisition by us are based on management accounts.

In addition to geographic diversification, we also benefit from revenue diversification due to the broad
range of product and services that we offer, including cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet
and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services. The chart below presents the percentage of revenue
derived by product (as a percentage of gross revenue, excluding intercompany revenue) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition:

We also benefit from a currency mix that sees 85% of our revenues generated in euros (88% of after
giving full-year effect to the Wind Hellas Acquisition) or in geographies where the currency is pegged
to the euro in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which is a significant increase compared to
a currency mix of 73% of our gross revenues generated in euros or in geographies where the currency
is pegged to the euro in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

**_We have a large infrastructure portfolio of fiber, cable TV and mobile networks, that is advanced,_**
**_well-invested and with a broad reach across the region._**

We strive to be the most advanced media and telecommunications company in Southeastern Europe
and we believe that our fiber, mobile and cable TV infrastructure allows us to provide higher quality
digital TV, high-speed broadband and fixed-line telephony and mobile telephony than other operators
in our markets. Our network is well invested and has a relatively low cost to upgrade. In March 2021,
we announced an investment of more than €500 million over the next five years to extend our fiber
network into new areas and upgrade the existing network with 10 Gbps-enabled infrastructure based on
XGS-PON.

We operate the largest fiber network in the region across metropolitan areas in Southern Europe,
extending for approximately 50,000 kilometers. In Bulgaria, we operate the largest FTTx network,
which covers more than 1.3 million homes passed as of September 30, 2021 with symmetrical upload
and download speeds of up to 10 Gbps. Together with the VDSL network, our broadband network


-----

covers more than 1.8 million homes passed as of September 30, 2021, which represent approximately
64% of homes in Bulgaria. In Greece, Wind Hellas is one of the major fiber operators with a nationwide
network of more than 3,000 kilometers and close to half a million homes passed as of September 30,
2021 through a mix of fiber to the home (FttH) and fiber to the cabinet (FttC) networks. We see
significant further growth opportunity in FttH networks in the underpenetrated Greek market where we
have a dedicated rollout platform and wholesale team in place. In Croatia, Optima Telekom has a
nationwide optical fiber network over 3,000 kilometers and covers over half a million homes passed as
of September 30, 2021. We plan to invest €100 million in the coming years to further upgrade our
network in Croatia.

We also operate an advanced proprietary HFC network which is fully bi-directional and EuroDOCSIS
3.0 enabled, covering all of our homes passed in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and
approximately 99% of homes passed in Slovenia as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021,
our cable network covers approximately 1.8 million homes passed, and 94% of our core network was
DOCSIS 3.1 ready. In addition, our network has an average homes passed per fiber optics node ratio in
the range of approximately 242, 206 and 219 across Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
respectively, which we believe is unrivalled in Southeastern Europe and compares favourably to other
European cable operators.

We also believe our average recorded download speed is consistently faster than those of our main
broadband competitors. In particular, we believe it is 1.7x faster in Serbia, 3.3x faster in Slovenia, 3.9x
faster in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 1.2x faster in Bulgaria.

We have nationwide mobile networks in Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece and Slovenia, where we own
approximately 4,700 towers, including both passive and active equipment, and have spectrum across
2G, 3G, 4G and 5G bands. Our mobile network covers the majority of the population in each of our
countries of operations through our extensive 2G/3G/4G networks, and at present we have the capability
to provide 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99 % and 98%, respectively, of the
Slovenian population, approximately 100% and 98%, respectively, of the Bulgarian population,
approximately 99% and 96%, respectively, of the Croatian population. Following the completion of the
Wind Hellas Acquisition, we will have the capability to provide 4G (LTE) coverage to approximately
98% of the Greek population. To further develop our networks, we have successfully tested and are
rolling out next generation 5G networks across our mobile-telephony footprint. We were the first mobile
operator to have launched 5G services in Slovenia in 2021 and our mobile network in Bulgaria was
named the fastest mobile in Europe by Ookla in both 2020 and 2021.

**_Our low churn rates demonstrate our loyal customer base and differentiated proposition._**

Our business model is attractive and resilient. We believe our portfolio of must-have products and our
superior offering have resulted in a growing and loyal customer base with relatively low churn rates of
approximately 9-11% per annum, combined with the ability to up sell and cross-sell products. Our
customers view the telecommunications products and services that we offer as part of their everyday
lives, which results in recurring, high demand for our products and makes our business more resilient
to macro-economic disruptions when compared to other discretionary products and services. For
example, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic our products and services have been instrumental in
providing connectivity and entertainment, as an increasing number of people began to work or study
remotely and spend significant amounts of time at home, which resulted in a significant increase in our
voice and data traffic. In this recurring, high demand environment, we believe we offer superior
products, faster broadband speeds and higher quality content than our competitors. Customer loyalty is
evidenced by our relatively low historical churn rates, which is defined as the percentage of customers
that no longer subscribe for a certain service compared to the average number of customers in a
particular month. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our unique cable subscriber churn
rate annualized was 10%, which is below recent reported cable subscriber churn rates of certain Western
European peers. We believe our relatively low churn rates provide, among other benefits, recurring cash


-----

flows and visibility with respect to future revenue. Moreover, these churn rates have persisted
notwithstanding regular price increases.

**_We have a strong track record of profitable growth driven by structurally attractive markets, cross-_**
**_selling opportunities and the successful integration of acquired assets._**

We have a strong track record of profitable growth, underpinned by relatively low penetration rates in
the markets in which we operate and cross-selling opportunities due to our scale, as well as a record of
successfully integrating acquisitions. We operate most of our business across countries in Southeastern
Europe that have relatively low penetration rates in Pay-TV and broadband, which we can capitalize on
via cross-selling due to our scale and comprehensive offering portfolio. As of September 30, 2021, our
Pay-TV penetration of homes passed and broadband internet were 61% and 89%, respectively, in
Slovenia, 63% and 74%, respectively, in Serbia, and 61% and 83%, respectively in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ Pay-TV and NGA fiber penetration in LLU &
NGA fiber base were 11% and 44%, respectively, in Greece. In addition, due to historically strong
regulatory constraints on bundling Pay-TV, broadband internet and telephony services, RGUs per cable
subscriber ratios in our key markets have lagged behind CEE and Western European cable markets. We
believe this demonstrates that there are strong opportunities to continue to utilize up selling and crossselling opportunities to grow our cable RGUs per subscriber ratio. The following table shows
comparisons of RGUs per cable subscriber in certain key CEE and Western European markets with
those of certain other industry members:

___________________________

_Source: Public company filings. As of September 30, 2021, for United Group, Telenet and Euskaltel and as of June 30, 2018_
_for the other industry peers. The methodologies used to calculate and report RGUs and RGUs per cable subscriber by certain_
_other industry members may vary._

Leveraging our extensive cable infrastructure, we use our high-quality Pay-TV content as a basis to
cross and up sell our broadband internet and telephony products to existing cable Pay-TV customers
and offer multi-play packages to new customers. This has allowed us to steadily improve penetration
rates as customers increasingly focus on the convenience of receiving their multimedia and
communications services in a bundled offer from one provider. For example, we have been able to
increase the number of quad-play subscribers in Slovenia from 1% in April 2015 to 40% as of
September 30, 2021. While Pay-TV penetration in all of our markets has been growing, it is still below
the levels of some Western European cable markets, which we believe continues to offer significant
growth opportunities.


-----

In addition to organic growth, we have successfully completed and integrated a large number of targeted
and value accretive investments and acquisitions of attractive cable and mobile assets, such as Vivacom,
Nova, Nova BG and Tele2 Croatia. For example, since our acquisition of Telemach Slovenia in 2009,
our Slovenia Group segment tripled blended cable ARPU (from €13 in 2008, to €35.4 in 2020) and UG
Adjusted EBITDA (from €24 million in 2008, to €89.4 million in 2020) and the Group grew revenue
from €46 million in 2008 to €1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. This was achieved
through both organic growth and the acquisition of Tušmobil in April 2015, which provided us with an
opportunity to create a fully convergent telecom operator in Slovenia. More recently, we have
successfully integrated Vivacom into our Group and have accelerated its growth trajectory by launching
our industry leading OTT platform EON as well as unlimited mobile tariff plans to support growth in
the mobile business, by making further network investments and refreshing the Vivacom brand. As a
result, in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Vivacom’s total revenue increased by 5.4%
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Over the same period, Vivacom’s blended
cable ARPU increased by 4.9% to €9.7 from €9.2, mobile ARPU increased by 5.8% to €7.3 from €6.9,
and DTH ARPU increased by 5.0% to €8.4 from €8.0. We believe our strong track record of integrating
acquisitions benefits us as we acquire and integrate Wind Hellas.

**_We benefit from a highly experienced management team with a proven track record and significant_**
**_investment in the business._**

We have leveraged the significant industry experience and corporate background of our senior
management team to successfully expand our business from being a single country Pay-TV operator to
being a telecommunications and media services leader in Southeastern Europe, through bolt on
acquisitions, integration of cable assets and content companies and organic growth. Many of our key
management members have been with the business since its inception, including our founder and
chairman of our advisory board, Dragan Šolak; chief executive officer and group vice president of
marketing and media, Victoriya Boklag; and group vice president of operations, Violeta Vasilijević.
Our senior management team also includes Janez Živko, group vice president of finance, who joined in
March 2015 and had previously served as the chief financial officer of the Petrol Group, one of the
largest companies in Slovenia; Vladislav Ratajac, group vice president of corporate development, joined
management in 2011, having previously held positions at Mid Europa Partners and Deutsche Bank;
Željko Batistić, group vice president of technology who joined the group in 2012 as CEO of Telemach
Bosnia and prior to that held a number of technical and operational management positions in the
industry; and Dragica Pilipović Chaffey, group vice president of corporate affairs, joined the
management team in 2009 and had previously held a number of senior posts in the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Many members of our senior management team, including our
founder, have each held different positions within our business and have shaped the direction of our
development and growth within Southeastern Europe. In addition, certain members of management
hold significant equity stakes in the business, which amount to approximately 42%. See “Principal
_Shareholders.”_

We also benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of BC
Partners. BC Partners has strong telecommunications expertise and an extensive and successful track
record of investing in companies in Europe and in the telecommunications and information sectors.

**Strategy**

We aim to strengthen our telecommunications and media leadership positions in Southeastern Europe,
deliver exceptional revenue growth across segments and capitalize on operating leverage and continued
operating efficiencies to deliver strong profitability and cash flow generation, all while providing our
customers the best products and services in each of our segments and markets. In order to achieve these
goals, we have identified the following strategic pillars:

**_Continued focus on our competitive market positions by leveraging our advanced network,_**
**_differentiated content offerings and loyal customer base._**


-----

We are the leading multi-play provider in Southeastern Europe and hold leadership positions across
each of our countries of operations and product categories. We have achieved these competitive market
positions over the years and we aim to maintain and strengthen them going forward and to further
develop our business in attractive markets in Southeastern Europe. In order to achieve this, we intend
to continue to expand the coverage and capacity of our superior next generation infrastructure in our
footprint, including 5G capability, where the return on investment is appropriate. We also intend to
continue to offer our loyal customer base the most attractive and differentiated content offerings in the
region, with better content choice, speed, functionality and service quality compared to our competitors,
at prices that allow us to deliver compelling value.

**_Increase service penetration across the region by cross-selling products and services and up selling_**
**_value adding products to existing customers._**

We intend to continue to focus on pursuing subscriber growth opportunities in our relatively underpenetrated markets. Over time, we expect our businesses in Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and Bosnia and
Herzegovina to converge with Slovenia in terms of broadband and Pay-TV penetration as well as in
service penetration (measured by RGU per subscriber). To achieve this, we aim to increase triple play
(and in the case of Slovenia and Bulgaria, quad-play) penetration and reduce churn rates by continuing
to shift focus in marketing and subscriber interactions from single services to bundled services. We
intend to continue to promote our bundled services by further leveraging our high-quality network and
utilizing our next generation digital television services, attractive local content and high-speed
broadband services and, where applicable, mobile-telephony services. We plan to offer more add-on
products and incentivize longer term contracts by offering better pricing and subsidies for certain
products. We also aim to capitalize on our superior high-speed broadband capabilities to increase
revenue. Specifically, we intend to continue migrating our existing high-speed broadband subscribers
to higher speeds, which we believe will further support broadband ARPU growth and reduce residential
subscriber churn rates. Following the Wind Hellas Acquisition, we intend to leverage the combination
with our existing Greek pay-TV provider NOVA to seize significant cross-selling, bundling and pricing
optimization opportunities in Greece.

**_Continue to consolidate our position as the leading media company in Southeastern Europe._**

Since inception, our media strategy has been centered on differentiating our offering by producing
superior and/or exclusive Pay-TV channels for our customers. We have applied this philosophy to all
of our Group companies with great success, and we have created an attractive portfolio of full format
national as well as specialized, thematic Pay-TV channels that we believe are a must-have on all
regional distribution platforms. Following the acquisition of Vivacom, Nova BG and Nova and their
integration into our operations, we are applying this philosophy in Bulgaria and Greece. We intend to
consolidate our leadership in Southeastern Europe and continue to grow our content offering by further
developing our portfolio of owned content, entering into strategic partnerships with third-party content
owners and acquiring other content owners in the region, as in the past with the acquisition of Nova TV
Croatia and Direct Media/Pink.

**_Further expand our addressable market by utilizing our OTT platform and attractive content._**

Leveraging our strong brands and our attractive content, we intend to continue to develop our two OTT
content platforms, our regional OTT platform, EON, and our international OTT platform, NetTV Plus,
to further expand our addressable market to areas outside our cable footprint. While our DTH Pay-TV
platform aims to deliver our content to subscribers in rural areas in our markets without cable
infrastructure, our regional OTT platform enables customers in metropolitan areas outside of our cable
footprint, who have subscribed to the broadband internet services of our competitors, to access our
attractive portfolio of Pay-TV channels and unique user interface and customer experience.
Additionally, NetTV Plus allows us to provide over 200 local language channels showing ethnic content
to the entire ex-Yugoslav diaspora around the world. By expanding our geographic reach to customers
in countries in Western Europe and North America, we believe that we are well positioned to further


-----

increase our RGU base and earnings potential. We have a plan to further invest in our in-house software
development of customer premises equipment for our TV and broadband services. With a unified
software solution, we will be able to provide all our service through a unified TV Box or broadband
gateway to any type of networks (OTT, Fiber, Cable or Mobile). We also plan to start developing a new
generation of digital streaming social applications, based on automated content, personalization and
advanced targeted advertising solutions. In addition, we have recently started the in-house development
of artificial intelligence engine software solutions, with dedicated teams who will develop machine
learning models for our content production, content recommendation system and advertisement
solutions.

**_Continued focus on innovation._**

We seek to continue innovating and enhancing our product offering to offer our customers an improved
use experience across our products, further strengthen our leading position across our countries of
operation and enter new markets. Our centralized in-house technology innovation and software
development center, United.Cloud, enables us to focus on leading the introduction of cutting-edge
television and broadband internet services and solutions such as EON (our next generation video
delivery platform which allows customers to watch their favorite channels on a broad range of devices),
UNIFON (our proprietary VoIP application connecting customers’ fixed-line telephones outside of their
homes), our self-help application, enhanced TV features such as VoD and CatchUp TV services and
many others. We also intend to continue promoting the digitalization of internal and external processes
to improve customer satisfaction and profitability. In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the
broadband and Pay-TV markets to launch Shoppster, our regional e-commerce online-shopping
platform. We intend for Shoppster to continue delivering the simple, reliable and secure e-shopping
experience that modern consumers expect.

**_Continue to grow our customer base and operations through value accretive acquisitions and_**
**_optimize our portfolio._**

We have a successful track record of making acquisitions on attractive terms and successfully
integrating those acquisitions. Between 2011 and September 30, 2021, we have acquired and integrated
(or are in the process of integrating) approximately 50 cable TV operators, content platforms, media
companies, mobile service providers, B2B service providers and ISPs in Southeastern Europe. Most
recently, we have expanded our addressable market through the acquisition of Vivacom and Nova
Broadcasting in Bulgaria, Nova and, pending completion, Wind Hellas in Greece and Optima Telekom
in Croatia, as well as various other recent acquisitions. As a result, we have significantly improved our
business profile in terms of scale, geographic exposure and currency mix and product diversification.
Our acquisition strategy consists of expanding our scale in a value accretive manner, enhancing our
content offering, expanding our fixed-line and mobile-telephony operations and leveraging our
experience and successful acquisition history to continue to integrate businesses and generate additional
value by increasing scale and product offerings.

The Wind Hellas Acquisition provides us with the opportunity to increase our penetration into the Greek
market following our acquisition of Nova in 2020, increasing our scale and leadership across
Southeastern Europe, further diversifying our revenue streams and improving our currency mix, while
also providing significant upside arising from our strength in cross-selling, bundling and pricing
optimization. We intend to leverage our know-how arising from our highly successful acquisition track
record to successfully integrate Wind Hellas and realize its upside potential. As part of our integration
plan, we intend to combine Wind Hellas with our existing Greek pay-TV provider NOVA to develop a
quad-play market challenger operator, and the number two player in Greece in both broadband internet
and television services. We believe this combination will enable us to deliver a higher value to our
customers in the Greek market by providing a broad range of new technologies and superior services.

Going forward, we plan to continue to make value accretive acquisitions at attractive multiples to
integrate regional service providers, cable assets and fixed-line and mobile-telephony operators into the


-----

business. We intend to continue taking a disciplined approach to acquisitions by assessing individual
opportunities as and when they arise on the basis of merit, ability to integrate assets into our existing
business plans and potential for value creation.

While we continue to grow our business, we also continue to assess opportunities to optimize our
portfolio of assets and maximize value for our stakeholders as those opportunities arise. To that end,
we have taken initial steps to explore a possible sale of our mobile tower portfolios in Bulgaria, Slovenia
and Croatia. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not begun a sale process, identified
a buyer or determined any price or other terms for such a transaction. We currently do not have a
definitive timeline or commitment for any such sale, and we could decide not to proceed with such a
sale at any time.

**_Continue to focus on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) Matters_**

We and our shareholders recognize that developing a sustainable and responsible business that has a
positive social impact is key to our future success. As we have grown our Group, we have increased
our emphasis on integrating ESG considerations into the key aspects of our operations, including our
decision-making and reporting processes, and we intend to continue to increase our focus on ESG
matters going forward, including by implementing the ESG action plan and roadmap prepared by our
dedicated ESG coordinator in 2020 in consultation with external advisors.

To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we are taking active steps to minimize our
environmental footprint, while also collecting and analyzing Group historical data to set future KPI
targets. We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately make all of our
operations carbon-neutral. We intend to leverage our experience in establishing a solar power plant in
Slovenia in 2019 to look for additional green energy projects which could cover a significant part of
our carbon emission footprint. For example, on November 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of a
majority ownership in Tessa Energy in Bulgaria, which we expect will invest in the Kremena Wind
Park, which has a 70MW capacity and will allow us to significantly decrease our carbon footprint. We
also intend to continue to use electric vehicles in our operations where feasible, and work to exchange
old, less-energy efficient equipment for more energy-efficient devices. In 2020, we generated
approximately 128.1 thousand tons of CO2 emissions (9.3 thousand tons of scope 1 emissions and 118.8
thousand tons of scope 2 and 3 emissions), including the contribution of acquired companies. We intend
to reduce these by approximately 60%, or 50.6 thousand tons, by 2030. In addition, in 2020, we recycled
1,539 tons of network telecom equipment, batteries, cables, paper and cardboard. Our goal going
forward is to continue minimizing waste by repurposing, reusing or recycling 100% of returned
customer devices and accessories.

We support social and economic development in Southern Europe and aim to build the region’s most
advanced digital telecommunications infrastructure. In particular, we intend to invest approximately
one billion euros by the middle of this decade to modernize and expand our network to ensure it can
support the future needs of our customers. In 2020, we named a Group-level director for corporate social
responsibility and we plan to continue actively supporting the communities in which we operate. We
have as a Group donated €4.7 million in 2020 and €1.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2021, to groups and activities dedicated to protecting the environment, education and the socially
vulnerable, including donations of personal protective equipment to help fight COVID-19. We intend
to continue to engage in community engagement activities such as those we have carried out in the past
few years, with a focus on delivering knowledge to children, students, the general public and
disadvantaged groups, by leveraging our core competencies in broadband internet and other
telecommunications. For 2022, we aim to increase the percentage of staff participating in a community
engagement activity (e.g., volunteering time or knowledge), which in 2021 stood at 7% (excluding
United Media).

We focus on building a safe, fair and inclusive working environment for our employees. To inform our
diversity, inclusion and safety targets, we intend to continue collecting data on our workforce, such as


-----

gender mix, percentage of women in management positions and percentage of disabled employees to
set future targets. We also have mandated diversity and inclusion rules, and have documented these in
employee manuals at our Group companies. To facilitate further transparency and accountability, we
plan to expand our anonymous suggestion boxes already present in certain of our Group companies and
establish whistle-blowing programs as a distinct transparency function. We also plan to continue to
offer training programs to employees focused on improving job-related technical and management
skills, as well as on compliance with our internal policies.

**History**

Our founder and chairman of our advisory board, Dragan Šolak, founded the company as a Serbian
cable TV operator in 2000. Between 2001 and 2005, we grew our business by constructing an advanced
cable network throughout Serbia. We also consolidated several sub-scale family owned cable operators
and successfully integrated them into our business. We launched our DTH services, Total TV, in Serbia
in 2006 and in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in 2007 and expanded Total TV into
Croatia in 2008 (divested in 2018) and North Macedonia in 2009. In 2007, we entered into a strategic
alliance with Sport Klub, and we acquired a controlling stake in the Ultra family of Pay-TV channels
in 2009. As a result of our strategic alliances, as well as the acquisition of local language television
channels, we were among the first pay-TV providers in Southeastern Europe to provide localized
regional and international content.

In 2009, we acquired Telemach Slovenia, a leading triple-play provider in Slovenia. During 2010, our
consolidation of three cable pay-TV operators in Sarajevo, including KT Global Net, BH Cabel Net and
ELOB, led to the formation of Telemach BH. In addition, over time we have amassed a comprehensive
portfolio of owned pay-TV channels, covering sports, movies, news, music, general entertainment and
children’s programming, through our United Media business, which we have grown through focused
and consistent investment. We continue to leverage our position as the sole credible consolidator in the
fragmented regional markets and have successfully acquired and integrated a number of businesses
since 2010, including Maxtel in 2016, a local B2B internet provider in Slovenia, and Ikom in 2017, a
cable operator in Serbia. In addition, following the acquisition of M kabl in 2016, a cable operator in
Montenegro, we have further expanded our subscriber base in Montenegro.

Following the liberalization of the fixed-line telephone markets in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia
in 2011 and 2012, respectively, we launched fixed-line telephony services in these two markets and,
leveraging our existing cable pay-TV and broadband internet subscriber base, became the secondlargest Serbian fixed-line telephone services provider in June 2013. We also launched our MVNO
services in Slovenia in late 2012 and became an MNO upon our acquisition of Tušmobil in 2015, which
allowed us to provide quad-play bundles (cable pay-TV, broadband internet, and fixed-line telephony
and mobile-telephony services) to our subscribers in Slovenia, in addition to stand-alone mobiletelephony services.

In July 2018, we acquired Nova TV d.d., which helped us further differentiate our distribution platform
and promote our pay-TV channels, creating a strong mainstream media platform for additional bolt on,
accretive acquisitions. In September 2018, we acquired Direct Media, a leading media buying agency
in Serbia, which included Direct Media’s operations in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and
Albania, as well as our terrestrial TV stations Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro, which have been
rebranded Nova BH and Nova M, respectively.

In March, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Tele2 Croatia, the third largest telecommunications
operator in Croatia based on mobile revenues as of September 30, 2020. Tele2 Croatia seeks to offer
the best value proposition in the Croatian mobile market, for example, through its offering of unlimited
mobile services. Now trading as Telemach Croatia, the acquisition has enabled us to accelerate our
growth and further diversify our operations.


-----

In July, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Vivacom, the market leading integrated
telecommunications operator in Bulgaria (based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020)
which offers both fixed and mobile telecommunications services, as well as broadcasting and satellite
services, with a market share of 30% in Bulgaria by revenue as of December 31, 2019, according to the
CRC. Expansion in Bulgaria increased our addressable market by approximately 35% in terms of
population, and the addition of Vivacom’s subscriber base more than doubled our existing subscriber
base. We believe that the acquisition of Vivacom provided us with greater scale and increased business
diversification, expanded our reach, cemented our leadership position as the industry leader in
Southeastern Europe and continued our growth.

In November 2020, we acquired a controlling interest in Forthnet S.A., the second-largest telecom
operator and Pay-TV provider in Greece. In June 2021, we renamed Forthnet S.A. as Nova. Nova
provides home entertainment and communications services to nearly 1.4 million RGUs. This marked
our entry into the Greek market and enabled us to further diversify and strengthen our position as an
industry leader in Southeastern Europe, accelerating growth. In May 2021, we acquired the remaining
shares in Nova following a mandatory tender offer and a squeeze-out procedure.

In January 2021, we acquired Bulgaria’s largest multi-platform media company, Nova Broadcasting
Group EOOD, providing a strong base for our content offering in Bulgaria. In July 2021, we signed an
agreement to acquire a majority interest in Croatian telecommunication operator Optima Telekom.
Optima Telekom offers a broad range of fixed broadband internet services to approximately 111
thousand subscribers and pay-TV services to approximately 56 thousand subscribers in Croatia. Upon
completion, the Optima Telekom Acquisition will allow us to further expand our presence in the
Croatian market enabling us to offer a full range of telecommunication services, including pay-TV,
through our existing infrastructure.

In April 2021, we acquired Bulgarian local broadband and television operators Net 1 EOOD, ComNet
Sofia EAD and Digital Cable Television EOOD and agreed to acquire Networx-Bulgaria EOOD. As of
the date of this offering memorandum, the acquisition of Networx-Bulgaria EOOD has not been
completed.

In August 2021, we agreed to acquire Wind Hellas, a leading integrated telecommunications operator
in Greece, furthering our penetration into the Greek market following our acquisition of Nova in 2020.
The Wind Hellas Acquisition was approved by the European Commission on December 21, 2021, and
we expect it to be consummated on or about January 12, 2022. Wind Hellas is one of the three integrated
communication providers in Greece with proprietary mobile and fixed-line networks. As of September
30, 2021, it offers mobile and fixed-line telecommunication, high-speed internet services and Pay-TV
services under a unified brand and on a national basis to over 4.1 million subscribers.

In August 2021, we also agreed to acquire an 80% ownership interest in Bulgarian energy company,
Tessa Energy EOOD. The transaction was completed on November 30, 2021. Tessa Energy EOOD will
invest in the Kremena Wind Park, which has 70MW capacity. With this investment, we will be
producing more energy than we currently consume in Bulgaria and we expect this will significantly
decrease our carbon footprint.

On November 9, 2021, we acquired a 33% stake in Marquee TV, a specialist streaming service for arts
and culture, for a consideration of £4.8 million.

On November 30, 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire Telnet OOD, a cable operator in Bulgaria.
Completion of the transaction is subject to customary approvals, which are currently pending.

**Distribution Product Offerings**

We offer our subscribers a broad range of cable and satellite pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line
and mobile-telephony services in the following categories:


-----

___________________________

(1) Product brands have been rolled out in Bulgaria and Greece as of the date of this offering memorandum.

**_Cable Pay-TV_**

We provide analog and digital cable pay-TV to approximately 1,609 thousand subscribers throughout
our network in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Montenegro as of September
30, 2021. In particular, our pay-TV subscribers were 213 thousand in Slovenia (61% of homes passed),
733 thousand in Serbia (63% of homes passed), 210 thousand in Bosnia (61% of homes passed), 32
thousand in Montenegro (32% of homes passed) and 419 thousand in Bulgaria (23% of homes passed),
in each case as of September 30, 2021. Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we
will also offer IPTV services to approximately 56 thousand subscribers in Croatia. In line with our
business strategy, we leverage our extensive cable network and distinctive cable pay-TV content to
encourage our subscribers to purchase one of our bundles, which offer the convenience of being able to
receive television, broadband internet and telephony services from a single provider. As of September
30, 2021, approximately 65% of our cable pay-TV subscribers (including Vivacom) had purchased one
of our bundles.

We offer high-quality analog and digital pay-TV throughout our network. All of our pay-TV customers
receive our analog pay-TV service (“Basic TV”). Our Basic TV package has been standardized across
our network and offers customers access to dozens of TV channels in Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina. In addition to Basic TV, we provide our customers with the option to subscribe to our
digital cable pay-TV services (currently offered under the EON brand), and we focus on migrating
analog subscribers to digital services and on continuing to take advantage of the cross and up selling
opportunities provided by an influx of potential new customers switching from analog to digital cable
pay-TV. Our digital cable pay-TV service provides our customers with access to up to 428 digital
channels depending on the particular market, including a wide variety of HD channels and radio
stations. We offer channel line ups across a variety of popular genres, such as sports, children’s
entertainment and movies. We believe our high-quality and broad channel and content offering allows
us to take a distinctive position in the market as compared to our competitors. In July 2020, in
cooperation with Bosnian operator Trion Tel, we started offering EON bundle packages in Republika
Srpska (the Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina), where we previously had no cable presence,
through the GPON of Trion Tel. In October 2021, our Greek operator Nova introduced the EON
platform in Greece. EON pay-TV packages are offered in Greece together with superfast fiber internet
and voice services.


-----

In addition to our bundles, we also offer our subscribers digital add-on TV packages, each containing
premium SD and HD television channels, such as HBO, as well as bundled VoD options for subscribers
who have leased one of our digital receivers. Our digital cable pay-TV service also includes CatchUp
TV and VoD services. CatchUp TV provides subscribers with the ability to view a wide variety of
television programs from a group of popular channels at any time within seven days after the programs
originally aired. VoD provides subscribers with access to a library of over 26,000 movies and other
programming titles, either on a transactional basis or a monthly subscription contract.

In 2012, we launched our TV everywhere applications (currently offered under the EON brand) for
computer, tablet and mobile devices. Through these applications, we provide our existing cable payTV subscribers with access to our digital pay-TV content “on the go.” Our TV everywhere content is
also available to our mobile subscribers in Slovenia over our mobile network.

In Bulgaria, we offer IPTV services through Vivacom, including over 240 channels with a wide variety
of HD channels, as well as the corresponding equipment. Our IPTV service includes interactive features,
a “video on demand” library with more than 20,000 titles and an own movie channel called “VIVACOM
Arena.” We have content distribution agreements in place with a number of major content providers
and provides IPTV GO service to customers outside the area of coverage of its network in Bulgaria. We
also offer mobile TV under Vivacom’s TV GO brand. Customers can choose between a mix of channels
and sports content with DiemaXtra and MAX Sport Plus, or one or all of the VOD sections:
VIVACOM’s MAXI, HBO On Demand and Disney English. Our mobile subscribers in Bulgaria can
order any content available on TV GO directly on the recently updated application with a new UI/UX
design.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our analog and digital cable pay-TV business segment
generated total revenues of €160.1 million and an average ARPU of €11.1. In particular, for the nine
months ended September 30 2021, our Slovenia Group segment’s cable pay-TV services generated
revenues of €36.8 million and an ARPU of €18.0; our Serbia Group segment’s cable pay-TV services
generated revenues of €72.6 million and an ARPU of €10.7; our Bosnia Group segment’s cable payTV services generated revenues of €20.6 million and an ARPU of €10.7; our Montenegro Group
segment’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of €3.5 million and an ARPU of €12.0; and our
Bulgaria Group segment’s cable pay-TV services generated revenues of €26.7 million and an ARPU of
€8.0.

**_Direct to Home Pay-TV_**

Our DTH, or satellite, pay-TV service, known as Total TV, is targeted at households outside our cable
footprint across Southeastern Europe. Total TV provides subscribers with access to up to 165 channels
in Serbia, 155 channels in Slovenia, and 175 channels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case including
a wide variety of channels also available HD format. In Bulgaria, we offer DTH pay-TV with over 165
channels, including HD channels, as well as multi-feed with over 200 additional channels. In Greece,
we offer DTH pay-TV under the Nova Sports, Nova Cinema and Nova Go brands, with 99 channels,
including more than half in HD. As we only actively market our DTH offering in those areas that are
outside our cable footprint, there is limited to no overlap with analog and digital cable Pay-TV offering.
Additionally, there is a low risk of cable pay-TV cannibalization, due to the fact that, for a similar price
as basic DTH pay-TV services, our basic cable pay-TV services offer a better value.

As with our analog and digital cable pay-TV offering, customers can choose from a range of DTH
packages across different price points. Additionally, we have entered into partnership agreements with
Telekom Slovenije in Slovenia and Telekom Srbija in Serbia pursuant to which we offer DTH pay-TV
content and re sell their respective ADSL internet services to customers outside of our cable footprint.

As of September 30, 2021, we provided our Total TV services to approximately 1,008 thousand
subscribers throughout Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia


-----

and Montenegro. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our DTH Pay-TV business segment
generated revenues of €113.6 million and an ARPU of €12.4.

**_OTT Television_**

Our OTT content platforms: our regional OTT platform (EON) and our international OTT platform
(NetTV Plus) have enabled us to further expand our reach:

- _Regional OTT. We operate a regional OTT platform under the EON brand in Slovenia, Serbia_
and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Greece. This platform enables customers of our competitors
for broadband internet within our regions (but outside of our cable footprint) to access our
distinctive digital content via the internet. Unlike our DTH pay-TV platform, which aims to
deliver content to subscribers in rural areas without cable infrastructure, our regional OTT
platform delivers pay-TV services to customers in metropolitan areas. By expanding our reach
beyond the traditional cable footprint using a regional OTT platform, we are able to increase
the number of subscribers to our pay-TV content. Please see “—Innovation—EON.”

- _International OTT. Our NetTV Plus platform, which we launched in 2013, provides up to 662_
channels, depending on particular market, including a wide variety of channels in HD and radio
channels, of which more than 250 local language TV channels showing ethnic content,
including all national free-to-air channel offering, to the Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian,
North Macedonian, Greek and Bulgarian diaspora (estimated at over 8 million people) around
the world through the internet. As of September 30, 2021, we had 107 thousand NetTV Plus
subscribers, indicating significant future growth opportunities, supported by the global
proliferation of high-speed internet access, which makes OTT one of the most viable platforms
to access ethnic content. Subscribers can access our NetTV Plus content through their TVs
using a set-top box connected to the internet, “Smart TVs” that have built in internet
functionality or by streaming content via internet enabled tablets, mobile devices and personal
computers. By expanding our geographic reach outside our region to customers in affluent
countries in Western Europe and North America, we are positioned to charge prices that are
higher than the prices we are able to charge for our pay-TV services in our other markets in
Southeastern Europe.

**_Broadband Internet_**

We offer broadband internet in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro and
Greece. Beginning in 2009, we upgraded our network to EuroDOCSIS 3.0, and our network is fully
EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled. Our network offers our customers up to 1.6 Gbps download speeds. We
believe that EuroDOCSIS 3.0 is superior to DSL and on par with the FttH services offered by our
competitors. We currently provide internet download speeds that we believe compare favorably to the
national averages with our average recorded speeds being faster than that of the respective local
incumbent by a factor of 2.0x in Slovenia, 1.6x in Serbia and 2.9x in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as of
September 30, 2021. In Bulgaria, we provide an array of fixed broadband services over ADSL, VDSL
and FTTx connections.

As our broadband internet operations provide us with very attractive margins due to little additional
cost, we leverage our attractive pay-TV offering to sell broadband internet services to existing pay-TV
customers. As a result, we do not sell our broadband internet services on a stand-alone basis and
customers wishing to receive our broadband internet services must, at a minimum, subscribe to our
analog Basic TV package. As of September 30, 2021, we provided our broadband internet service to
approximately 1.5 million subscribers across our Slovenia Group, Serbia Group, Bosnia Group,
Bulgaria Group and Montenegro Group segments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our
broadband internet business generated revenues of €229.0 million and an ARPU of €9.5.

Within Slovenia, in a large portion of our cable footprint, our competitors offer DSL services and not
fiber, enabling us to provide the fastest broadband speed available within those areas. Our total

broadband market share in Slovenia was 31%, our fixed broadband penetration was 54% and 96% of
our customers received broadband speeds greater than 70 Mbps, in each case as of December 31, 2020.

In Serbia, our total broadband market share was 32%, our fixed broadband penetration was 47% and
86% of our customers received broadband speeds greater than 50 Mbps, in each case as of December
31, 2020.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, our total broadband market share was 22%, our fixed broadband penetration
in Bosnia and Herzegovina was 49% and 85% of our customers received broadband speeds higher than
30 Mbps, in each case as of December 31, 2020. While Bosnia and Herzegovina is generally not yet
making use of high-speed broadband higher than or equal to 30 Mbps, we believe Bosnia and
Herzegovina displays clear trends of acceleration.

In Bulgaria, we offer fixed broadband services over ADSL, VDSL and FTTx connections to both
residential and business customers as well as other data services such as the sale of CPEs, VPN and
MAN services and associated complex solutions. As of December 31, 2020, our total broadband market
share in Bulgaria was 25%.

In addition, we offer out-of-footprint internet services (broadband internet services provided through a
third-party network) across Greece to approximately 529 thousand subscribers through Nova as of
September 30, 2021. Following completion of the Optima Telekom Acquisition, we will offer
broadband internet services to approximately 111 thousand subscribers in Croatia.

**_Fixed-line Telephony_**

We offer telephony services using VoIP, which allows our subscribers to make traditional fixed-line
telephone calls using a standard telephone handset. We offer fixed-line telephony services in Serbia,
Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Montenegro. We intend to leverage on our existing
customer base and our extensive network and high-quality pay-TV content to cross-sell telephony
products and bundled products to new and existing customers. Accordingly, other than in Bulgaria, our
fixed-line telephony services are only available to our existing cable pay-TV customers. We also offer
out-of-footprint telephony services (telephony provided through a third-party network) across Greece.
The total fixed-line telephony Greek market in 2020 was estimated at 4,852 thousand subscribers
(compared to 534 thousand out-of-footprint subscribers for Nova as of September 30, 2021), which we
believe represents significant growth potential for us.

Our “Basic Package” in Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro offers free calls
within the Group network and only an analog touchtone phone is required to use our service. In addition
to our Basic Package, we offer our subscribers various other packages, which include free calls to
customers of other regional fixed-line telephony providers. Despite the relatively recent launch of our
fixed-line telephony operations in Serbia, we believe it is the second-largest provider of fixed-line
telephony services in Serbia behind the incumbent Telekom Srbija. We are the largest provider of fixedline telephony operations in Bulgaria through Vivacom.

As of September 30, 2021, we provided our fixed-line telephony services to 1,252 thousand subscribers,
of which 193 thousand in Slovenia, 450 thousand in Serbia, 105 thousand in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and 487 thousand in Bulgaria. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our fixed-line telephony
services generated revenues of €84.2 million and an ARPU of €4.2.

**_Mobile-telephony_**

_Slovenia Group segment_

We provide mobile voice, messaging and data to consumers and small businesses on a contract and prepaid basis, together with an attractive suite of fixed mobile convergence services in Slovenia, which we
believe has contributed to lower churn rates relative to our competitors. Since our acquisition of


-----

Tušmobil in 2015, we have been the fastest growing mobile operator in Slovenia. As a result of
consistent growth, as of December 31, 2020, we held a 24% market share in the Slovenian mobile
market (as compared to 14% at the end of 2015) and cross-sold mobile services to more than 50% of
our fixed-telephony subscriber base. Our growth over the last six years was largely underpinned by
continuous investments in our mobile and fixed- telephony network. In August 2020, we received, for
the second year in a row, the “Best in Test” award for both our mobile and fixed-telephony network by
Umlaut (formerly, P3 Group), an independent research agency. According to the Ipsos Brand Tracking
Report 2017, our “top of mind” recognition as a mobile provider in Slovenia was 21% in 2017, but by
September 2020, it had increased to 30%. Similarly, after the integration of Tušmobil, a higher
percentage of customers chose Telemach Slovenia as their first choice for mobile products in Slovenia,
while our primary competitors have experienced decreases or stagnation in this metric during the same
period. The following chart shows the evolution of customers’ first choice of brand:

___________________________

Our mobile network provides coverage to almost all of Slovenia’s population through our extensive
2G/ 3G/4G and as of June 2021 5G networks. Licenses for use of spectrum for 2G are valid through
2031, while spectrum for 3G is valid through 2021 (5 MHz on the 2100 band), 2023 (another 5 MHz
on the 2100 band) and 2031 (5 MHz on the 900 band). In 2016, we acquired additional spectrum in the
1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands, which allowed us to expand our 3G and 4G networks. Use of
frequencies in the LTE network currently includes 2x10 MHz in the 800 MHz spectrum band and 2x10
MHz in 1800 MHz spectrum band (which is the key spectrum band used for LTE services). These
licenses are valid through 2029 (800 MHz) and 2031 (1800 MHz). We are capable of providing 4G
(LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to 99 % and 98%, respectively, of the Slovenian population. In
addition, we have successfully tested and are rolling out next generation 5G networks across our mobiletelephony footprint. In April 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G
frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of 5G 3600 MHz in Slovenia in June
2021.

As of September 30, 2021, we had 612 thousand subscribers for our post-paid and pre-paid mobile
services in Slovenia. During each month of the first nine months of 2021, we achieved 32% of gross
additions in the mobile market, as compared to 32% during each month of 2020 and 31% during each
month of 2019. Our principal focus is post-paid subscribers, who generate significantly higher ARPU


-----

and generally have lower churn rates than pre-paid subscribers, and as of September 30, 2021, contract
subscribers accounted for 57% of our subscriber base.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our mobile-telephony services in Slovenia generated
revenues of €63.9 million and an ARPU of €10.9.

_Croatia Group segment_

We provide mobile-telephony services in Croatia through Telemach Croatia, the third largest
telecommunications operator in Croatia based on mobile revenues as of December 31, 2020, after
Croatian Telekom and A1. In the post-paid mobile segment, Telemach Croatia seeks to offer the best
value proposition in the Croatian mobile market, for example through its offering of unlimited mobile
services.

We have an extensive 2G/3G/4G mobile network covering all major cities and important roads in
Croatia. In February and March 2019, we acquired 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz frequencies, enhancing
spectrum capacity. In July 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Croatia for 5G frequencies,
and commenced deployment and commercial launch of our 5G C-Band in September 2021.

As of September 30, 2021, we offered mobile-telephony services to approximately 1 million subscribers
in Croatia. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our mobile-telephony services in Croatia
generated revenues of €110.0 million and an ARPU of €7.4.

_Bulgaria Group segment_

In Bulgaria, we are among the market leaders in offering mobile services. We offer mobile voice and
data services and products over GSM/GPRS/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA+/LTE networks, on either a
post-paid or pre-paid basis, through multiple volume based and flat rate offerings, each with multiple
tariff options, and we believe that Vivacom’s mobile post-paid offerings are some of the most
comprehensive in the Bulgarian telecommunications market. We offer other mobile services and
products, including the sale of mobile handsets and accessories. Such services include unlimited mobile
data, roaming voice and mobile data packages (within the European Union or within neighboring
countries), SMS and MMS and international calls to both fixed and mobile lines. In all of our post-paid
tariffs, we bundle mobile TV services under the TV GO brand, as well as music streaming (Tidal) and
cloud storage with mobile subscriptions. In addition, all of our customers have access to a digital wallet
(Pay by VIVACOM) that is currently free of charge. On September 21, 2020, we announced the
commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year
license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our Bulgaria segment’s mobile operations generated
revenues of €200.4 million. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 3.0 million mobile
subscribers in Bulgaria, of which approximately 86% were post-paid subscribers and approximately
14% were pre-paid subscribers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, blended mobile ARPU
was €7.4.

**_Media_**

Through focused and consistent investment over the last few years, and by a combination of our
investment in developing owned pay-TV content and in entering into strategic partnerships with
regional and international third-party content owners, we have built a comprehensive content offering,
covering sports, movies, news and children’s content. The following table provides an overview of our
content offerings:


-----

___________________________

Source: Company data

_Owned Content Business_

Through our owned-content business we directly own many of the region’s popular pay-TV channels,
including Sport Klub, the most popular sports channel in the region; Cinemania, a popular movie
channel that we improved through collaborations with notable studios in the United States; Fortuna
eSports, which broadcasts eSports events that we produce and organize; N1, an independent 24/7
regional news channel affiliated with CNN; Grand and Grand 2, 24/7 local music and entertainment
channels; Fight Channel, a Croatian channel with premium content focused on Ultimate Fighting
Championship; IDJ Digital Holding Limited, a digital distributor of music and online video content in
Malta; NewsMax Adria, a 24/7 cable news channel launched in 2020 in partnership with NewsMax
International; as well as several Nova-branded channels offering high-quality, locally produced content,
including Nova BG in Bulgaria and Nova TV in Croatia, Nova BH and Nova M (previously operating
as Pink BiH and Pink Montenegro) in Bosnia Herzegovina and Montenegro, and Nova S in Serbia.

We believe that the attractiveness of our content platform across key pay-TV genres supports the
sustainable leadership position of our distribution platform. While a significant part of our content
business’s revenue consists of carriage fees charged to our own distribution platforms (including
Vivacom, Telemach Slovenia, SBB Serbia and Telemach BH), we also generate revenues through
carriage fees paid by third-party distribution platforms, such as Hrvatski Telekom, A1 Bulgaria,
Bulsatcom, Macedonian Telekom, Bosnian Telekom, etc., sales of advertising and the sublicensing of
some of the sports and other TV rights we acquire or produce to regional free-to-air broadcasters. We
have been successful in broadening the distribution reach of our pay-TV channels and sold distribution
rights of some of these to other major cable operators in the region, such as N1, certain Grand Production
channels as well as Pikaboo and Vavoom, popular channels geared towards children. We have also
increased revenues from our DiemaSport channels in Bulgaria by successfully extending our existing
contracts with third-party pay-TV distributors and offering high-quality, varied sports content.

We have historically generally been successful in renewing these contracts on comparable terms,
although in 2021, we have lost the bids for the renewal of broadcasting rights for the English Premier
League and some other premium sports content in some of our countries of operations. The following
table sets forth the main sports broadcasting rights United Group held through its TV channels as at
September 30, 2021.

The variety that we offer in our content business allows us to tailor our approach for each individual
country and market in which we operate. We plan to continue to review our content offering and will
continue to develop our own distinctive content. We continue to view content differentiation as the
cornerstone of our strategy and to drive the attractiveness of our content offerings relative to those of
our competitors.

_Third-party Content_

In addition to our owned content offerings, our pay-TV distribution platforms typically license the rights
for the distribution of our channels, as well as third-party owned channels, typically for a period of three
to five years.

As the prominent pan-regional operator, we have been able to negotiate contracts with third-party
providers that we believe are beneficial. For example, we have been able to lock in flat-rate contracts
for content that provide for terms spanning multiple years, which benefits our profit margins as our
number of subscribers increases because we are able to retain the benefits of increases in our subscriber
base, and thereby increase our margins. We also pay royalties based on our subscribers’ usage of our
VoD content. We generally pay such license fees on a “per subscriber” basis. For on-demand content
purchased by subscribers (transactional VoD), we generally pay a revenue share of the retail price. For
packaged on-demand content, we pay on a “per- subscriber” basis (subscription VoD), often subject to
fixed minimum guarantees. If necessary, we also license third-party copyrights through various
collective rights associations. We generally seek to negotiate fixed-fee contracts and attempt to move
away from per- subscriber agreements. We expect that our content costs (above the minimum amounts)
will generally increase in line with increased revenues from digital pay-TV and on-demand content and
continued investment in high-quality content to differentiate our platform from our competitors. We
negotiate our contracts for content and other third-party rights on a Group-wide basis, so that we are
able to maximize the benefits of our scale and best practices across the Group, and we have historically
been successful at renewing these contracts on comparable terms. We plan to acquire additional
broadcasting rights in the future to further enhance our content offering.

In addition to licencing content offerings, we also seek to enter into strategic partnerships with, or make
strategic investment in, other media companies to support the enhancement of the varieties of content
proposition in the market. For example, on November 9, 2021, we acquired a 33% stake in Marquee
TV, a specialist streaming service for arts and culture, in an effort to better serve the vertical markets.

**_Wi Fi_**

Since 2011, we have been expanding our Wi Fi hotspot service in Serbia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and the service is currently offered under our UNIFI brand. In April 2017, we updated
our mobile packages, with more data, more calls and more text messaging, and introduced our UNIFI
Travel Wi Fi roaming application, providing access to more than 70 million Wi Fi hotspots in 120
countries around the world. To increase our brand recognition, all products include free on net calls
with unlimited off net national calls in medium and high end packages, and with the introduction of
new EU roaming regulations which took effect on June 15, 2017, customers can now utilize their text
message and voice minute allotments across the EU with no roaming charges. We intend to utilize
UNIFI to complement our bundled offering and reduce customer churn as well as to incentivize the use
of our products by potentially offering UNIFI free to only our subscribers. We believe this service offers
further monetization potential from users that are not our customers.

**_Multi-Play Services_**

One of our primary areas of focus is to provide bundled services, which consist of a package of two or
more of the following services: pay-TV, broadband internet services, fixed-line telephony and mobiletelephony. This enables our customers to subscribe to these services in a convenient “one stop shop”
manner at attractive prices that are lower when bundled than the sum of the stand-alone services of
similar value. We believe that the several bundled options we have introduced allow our customers to

247


-----

tailor their packages according to their requirements and offer them greater value for money compared
to similar services offered by our competitors. As of September 30, 2021, approximately 65% of our
cable customers subscribed to our multi-play packages. Our multi-play packages have allowed us to
increase our total RGUs for cable-based services to approximately 11.3 million RGUs as of September
30, 2021.

Our straightforward and unified triple-play offering, which includes pay television, broadband internet
services and fixed-line telephony, accounts for a significant percentage of our total new sales,
comprising 81% of our gross additions in Slovenia, 53% of our gross additions in Serbia, and 20% of
our gross additions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in each case for the nine months ended September 30,
2021. Our best-selling triple-play packages (each based on the number of triple-play gross additions in
the first three months of 2021) are: EON Light in Slovenia, EON Full in Serbia and EON Light in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have upgraded our triple-play offering consistently for both new and
existing customers, which has allowed us to raise prices over time.

**_E-commerce_**

In July 2020, we leveraged our position in both the broadband and pay-TV markets to launch Shoppster,
our regional e-commerce online-shopping platform, which offers more than 20 popular product
categories, including electronics, home and gardening, tools, fashion, items for children and kitchen
appliances. Shoppster is available as an integrated online and TV shopping platform in Serbia and
Slovenia. In Serbia, Shoppster operates as a marketplace using the dropshipping operating model,
whereby it does not stock the products it sells. In Slovenia, Shoppster operates as a retailer as a result
of an acquisition that we have completed and stores the products it sells in a leased warehouse. Products
sold though Shoppster are distributed by third-party delivery couriers in both Serbia and Slovenia.
Shoppster is a unique offering which combines the convenience of online-shopping with the audience
engagement of television. Products are presented and available for sale on the Shoppster TV channel,
which are devoted to home-shopping. Popular TV personalities from Southeastern Europe present
offers and products from the many companies that have joined Shoppster. We intend for Shoppster to
deliver the simple, reliable and secure e-shopping experience that modern consumers expect.

**Business Product Offerings**

We utilize our existing fixed-line network in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro
to offer a range of business products including virtual private networks, Wi Fi hotspots, managed
services and network capacity leases to telecommunications operators, financial institutions, public
service customers and multinational companies. We are the first CISCO certified partner for B2B
services in the region, and we aim to continually improve the service portfolio of our business products
by providing innovative and high-quality solutions along with dedicated customer care. We offer tailor
made solutions for modern businesses across various industry segments, as well as to carrier clients.

One of our key customers in the region is Telekom Austria. We provide network connection services
for Telekom Austria’s mobile phone towers as well as ‘last mile’ connection services for Telekom
Austria’s B2B clients. Other key international partners include Romtelecom, Tele2, Telia Company,
Pantel Technologies, Inteliquent, Interoute, Level 3 and PCCW.

We are also a leading provider of a full suite of telecommunications solutions for the corporate segment
in Bulgaria, with a portfolio of services suitable for all business sizes. All business mobile plans include
national and international minutes, mobile data and a range of other features that support companies in
running their businesses. We offer both customized services for larger customers and more standardized
products, such as all-inclusive tariff plans that have a set amount of minutes (national and international)
and data for a fixed monthly fee, for small and medium size companies.


-----

**Subscribers**

We sell our TV, broadband internet and fixed-line and mobile-telephony services, either on an
individual service subscription basis or on a bundled basis, to residential customers and business
customers. Our basic pay-TV subscription serves as a basis for cross-selling and up selling and, with
the exception of subscribers in Slovenia who generally prefer to subscribe only to our mobile-telephony
service, every subscriber needs at least a subscription for our basic pay-TV package to have access to
our other services.

Consumer subscriptions account for most of our revenues. Within the consumer market, we market our
services directly to subscribers in single dwelling units and multi-dwelling units, such as apartment
buildings. We provide our services pursuant to standard form fixed contracts lasting for 12 or 24
months. Our business subscribers typically purchase our broadband internet and voice and other data
services, and we generally target small to mid-size businesses in metropolitan regions. Business
subscriber contracts usually extend over a period of 24 months and cannot be prematurely cancelled
free of charge. We believe that we have a loyal customer base, which is the result of low churn rates
due to our high-quality content, extensive network coverage and high-quality customer service.

Additionally, as our network covers the most affluent regions in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece, our business benefits from low rates of
services termination due to customers’ inability to pay.

**Innovation**

United.Cloud is our technology innovation and software development center which we established in
2016 and has offices in Serbia and Slovenia. The centralization of our research and development team
within United.Cloud provides a significant improvement in time to market for our quality and
innovative products, with a high degree of customization and flexibility to ensure new product launches
are in line with our corporate strategy. We can create unified multi-service solutions to apply across all
our markets, such as EON, with the ability to enter new markets quickly due to technological autonomy
without a need to rely on outside developers, and our customers benefit from an improved user
experience across our products. We regularly introduce new products and continue to develop our
existing technology. Starting with D3 GO as a multiscreen option included in packages, we have added
additional features such as UNIFON, UNIFI and UNIFI Travel.


-----

Our continuous focus on product innovation has led to a strong track record of in-house development,
as shown in the following chart.

We also continue to invest in our network infrastructure. For example, Slovenia is a GIGA country.
Novi Sad, Subotica and Gornji Milanovac in Serbia are GIGA cities, while our plans for Belgrade are
nearly complete, with Kragujevac in Serbia planned to be next. Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina is
planned to be a GIGA city in 2021.

**_EON_**

EON is our next generation video delivery platform and an internally developed content management
and distribution system, which allows customers to watch their favorite channels on a range of devices,
including set-top boxes smartphones, tablets, laptops, and Smart TVs, with the ability to seamlessly
“hand off” and resume watching from one device to the next. EON is the first platform in the region to
allow viewers to watch TV through an application on a Smart TV. In establishing EON, which
developed out of the prior D3 platform, we have prioritized user customization, through the introduction
of user inputs such as reminders, favorites and search functions. The home screen includes editorial
content within a modern and intuitive user interface. The VoD component is extensive, with a CatchUp
feature allowing viewers to access content broadcasted within the previous seven days, totaling over 15
thousand hours of content available at any given time. EON gives users access to over 502 TV channels,
163 radio channels, and more than 25,000 VoD assets. We have also ensured that EON utilizes the latest
media encryption technology in order to protect against digital piracy. We have an additional stream of
game changing updates to be introduced to EON over the next two years, including cloud DVR,
“download to go” and improved connectivity with third-party devices and services. Our partnership
with Google will help us release the 4K Ultra HD set-top box, which will fully integrate Google
platforms such as YouTube and Google Play Store.

**_Digital Platform_**

Our digital platform provides a sustainable channel to future proof our platforms and to address evolving
customer habits around access to media, digital content and advertising consumption.

_Telecommunications_


-----

Our digital platform is an important element of our user experience, and we have recently focused on
innovations in our self-help platform, web portals and e-commerce. Our self-help platform allows users
to personalize their dashboards and access offers, pay their bills and receive assistance. We also utilize
our web portals as a central hub for all marketing activity and offer access to support services and the
ability to order products online.

_Media_

We have grown our media content offerings on our digital platform. Our most successful digital media
offerings are regional news and sport portals N1 and Sport Klub, as well as DNEVNIK.hr in Croatia
and Nova.rs in Serbia. N1 is a fully independent, stand-alone platform with more than 50 million users
as of September 30, 2021. Our regional sports news platform, Sport Klub, is split across three separate
web portals and a dedicated mobile application for iOS and Android, and had over 12 million web users
as of September 30, 2021. Launched in February 2020, Nova.rs in few months became one of the most
influential portals in Serbia with 35 million users as of September 30, 2021. Our news portal Danas has
increased the number of real users to 19 million and grew from the 13th to the 11th position among web
portals in Serbia according to Gemius ratings. In Croatia, our portal DNEVNIK.hr, with approximately
43 million users monthly, as of September 30, 2021, is the most visited web portal in Croatia, according
to Gemius ratings. Our Bulgarian operation NetInfo has reach 81% of total population, with nova.bg as
the most visited web portal in the country according to Gemius ratings.

**Customer Services**

Along with content differentiation, customer service is a key pillar of our offering, and we believe that
we offer subscribers high-quality customer service that is in line with Western European standards. Our
customer service operations are responsible for all customer care activities, including technical support
as well as handling queries and complaints from our customers. We operate dedicated customer contact
centers in Ljubljana, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Podgorica, Sofia and Pleven. As of September 30, 2021, our
customer service team employed approximately 847 employees (798 full-time equivalent). In Bulgaria,
we provide an additional service to high-value business customers who require proactive technical
support. In addition to call center services, customers also have at their disposal a variety of self-service
channels, such as an interactive voice response system, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data on
Vivacom’s mobile network and the My Vivacom application, which was launched in 2018, and provides
customers with 24/7 access to information about their services, customer data and current consumption,
and notifications as to billing information.

All customer service agents are regularly trained in soft skills and educated on new product offerings
and advertising campaigns. As is common in Western Europe, we constantly measure our team’s
response times and offer our subscribers the option to provide feedback on our service immediately
following the call. Additionally, we have a customer service team focusing on business retention, which
reaches out to existing subscribers prior to the expiration of such subscribers’ service contracts to extend
the service contract and advertise our products through various initiatives, including, for example,
Vivacom’s provision of mobile handset and tablet subsidies in order to grow its mobile subscriber base
and complimentary installations for certain business customers. We also have a specialized team for
sales and customer care in relation to our business services.

We believe our customer service representatives are trained in accordance with Western European
customer service standards, and we receive consistently high scores in our subscriber satisfaction
surveys.

**Marketing and Sales**

We work to provide a consistent image as a provider of “best in class” services and customer experience
and high-quality subscriber experience in the key areas that subscribers value. Our marketing, sales and
customer care department is responsible for designing and promoting new products and services to
customers, as well as building a high-quality customer experience throughout the entire “life cycle” of


-----

a customer relationship. We are able to leverage our owned content channels to cross promote our other
products and services to our customers, because we can advertise those other products and services on
our channels. We also market and sell our products using a broad range of sales outlets, including
through our leased retail stores which are located in attractive parts of town in our key regions and
markets, including in Ljubljana, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Sofia, third-party stores, telesales and our
partners’ websites. In Bulgaria, we market our products primarily through focused television
advertising, with billboards, press, radio and the internet as additional advertising outlets. In addition,
we sell services and products through direct channels, such as Vivacom owned stores and indirect
channels and a smaller number of third-party retail distributors. Vivacom’s distribution network is
further supported by remote channels such as e-commerce platforms. As of September 30, 2021, our
marketing, sales and customer care teams comprised 5,293 employees (4,766 full-time equivalent).

To strengthen our brand recognition, we have entered into a number of sponsorship and partnership
agreements with local, regional and national sports associations. For example, Vivacom partners with
well-known mobile handset brands, and in 2020, it launched its official partnership with Apple.
Additionally, we make donations to social institutions, such as youth organizations, across the region.

**Network**

We operate an advanced proprietary HFC network which is fully bi-directional and EuroDOCSIS 3.0
enabled, covering all of our homes passed in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and
approximately 99% of homes passed in Slovenia as of September 30, 2021. We also operate the largest
fiber network in the region, extending for approximately 50,000 kilometers across metropolitan areas
in Southern Europe. As of September 30, 2021, our cable network covers approximately 1.8 million
homes passed, and 94% of our core network was DOCSIS 3.1 ready.

We also employ a variety of network technologies to deliver products and services to our customers,
which include, among others, GPON technologies on 29% of our footprint, XGS 10/10 Gbps speed
FttH access network that is set to be introduced throughout the Group in 2021, as well as market leading
broadband speed through our network, of which approximately 70% is gigabit-capable. In addition, we
are the first in the region to offer OTT services to customers, which began in 2013.

_Cable and Satellite_

Cable

We provide our pay-TV, broadband internet infrastructure access and fixed-line telephony services
through our extensive cable network which we believe is one of the most technologically advanced
networks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our cable network covers approximately 3.8 million
homes passed as of September 30, 2021 and generally covers the most affluent areas in our key markets.
Specifically, as of September 30, 2021, our network passed approximately 351 thousand homes, or
approximately 47% of all households, in Slovenia, 1,156 thousand homes, or approximately 48% of all
households, in Serbia, 348 thousand homes, or approximately 30% of all households, in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, 101 thousand homes, or approximately 51% of all households, in Montenegro, 1,856
thousand homes (939 thousand FTTx homes and 505 thousand VDSL homes), or approximately 62%
of all households, in Bulgaria and 3,432 thousand homes (through xDSL), or approximately 78% of all
households, in Greece.

Our network in Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia Herzegovina generally offers better capacity, speed and
quality advantages compared to copper-based DSL networks. In particular, an HFC cable network
offers larger bandwidth than ordinary copper cable and, unlike the latter, it is not significantly affected
by attenuation (a reduction in the strength of the signal) or distortion (reduction in quality of the signal)
when the signal is carried over a long distance. We also offer significantly more bandwidth capacity
than the average broadband customer uses. While broadband data consumption has increased across


-----

Slovenia, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, installed capacity is higher than the average used
capacity by a significant margin, as shown in the charts below.

Our HFC network is fully bi-directional in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and approximately 99%
of HFC homes passed in Slovenia are bi-directional as of September 30, 2021. Our bi-directional
network enables us to deliver broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, and other interactive services
such as VoD, to our customers throughout our cable network, in addition to regular digital and analog
television services.

Our cable network is EuroDOCSIS 3.0 enabled, covering our cable broadband internet RGUs in
Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which allows us to offer theoretical maximum speed
levels of up to 1,600 Mbps with 32 allocated frequency channels. In Montenegro, we continue to
upgrade the network to Group standards following our acquisitions. We believe we offer one of the
highest available speeds in our cable footprint, ranging between 100-1,000 Mbps. We also have industry
leading node density. A lower node density mitigates the risk of network congestion and related
reductions in quality of service.

As of September 30, 2021, our HFC network has homes passed per fiber optics node ratios of
approximately 242:1 in Slovenia, approximately 206:1 in Serbia, approximately 219:1 in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and approximately 126:1 in Montenegro, which we believe is unrivalled in Southeastern
Europe and compares favorably to Central and Eastern European cable benchmarks. This means our
fiber optic nodes typically only extend a very short distance from subscribers’ homes and offices, with
only the last few hundred meters connected through coaxial cables. This allows us to provide high
broadband internet access speeds and advanced services to subscribers.

In Bulgaria, our network provides for a fully digitalized fixed-telephony services and ADSL, VDSL
and fiber connections that offer commercially available speeds of up to 20 Mbps, 50 Mbps and 1,000
Mbps, respectively. Vivacom began its FTTx roll out in 2011 in Sofia and Varna and has since achieved
significant progress from 402 thousand fiber homes passed in 2012 to 1,318 thousand fiber homes
passed with a 29% take-up rate as of September 30, 2021. We believe that our fixed-line network is the
largest in Bulgaria. We also have a fully owned fiber backbone network that includes a Dense
Wavelength Division Multiplexing fiber network that allows for easy capacity extension and is able to
route all backbone traffic via this infrastructure. We maintain a disciplined approach to expanding our
fiber network in carefully selected areas in Bulgaria and adhering to stringent project acceptance
criteria. We believe Vivacom’s low build out costs are attributable to its ownership of the telecom ducts
and the low-cost of labor in Bulgaria, allowing for an attractive return on investments in fiber.


-----

In Greece, we operate and maintain a fiber optic network extending 5,996 kilometers and provide
services based mainly on xDSL technologies. We hold a regulated local loop unbundling agreement
with the incumbent telecommunications provider. As of September 30, 2021, we were able to serve
78.1% (92.6% in NGA eligible fixed lines) of the Greek population through Nova’s co-locations in
local exchanges and interconnections with wholesale providers.

Overall, we operate one of the most extensive backbone networks across the region with an international
backbone consisting of approximately 23,976 kilometers (as of September 30, 2021) owned and leased
dense wavelength division multiplexing fiber links that extend across Southeastern Europe with
international optical interconnections to Vienna, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London. Such extensive
fiber rich backbone not only supports our HFC cable network but also makes us a partner of choice for
regional telecoms and other business customers. We rent ducts and poles from third-parties as a part of
our network, except in Bulgaria.

FttH is our technology of choice for greenfield expansion and new buildings in adjacent areas. As of
September 30, 2021, we passed 1,093 thousand homes with FttH and had 243 thousand active users
across Serbia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In addition to FttH
greenfield expansion, during the third quarter of 2018, we introduced Gigabit speeds in areas where
digitalization of analog TV signals was completed.

Satellite Services

We complement our cable network with DTH and mobile offerings. We contract for satellite services
with EUTELSAT, which transmits our satellite programming over their satellite networks to our
customers. Data streams are sent to satellites that transmit the signal to local satellite receivers. Our
transponder allotment agreements with EUTELSAT are valid until December 31, 2024. Pursuant to a
services agreement entered into with EUTELSAT in December 2014, we replaced all our subscriber
reception boxes in Serbia in order to permit the reception of HD and MPEG 4 transmissions to our
subscribers via the transponders currently allocated to SBB Serbia on the EUTELSAT 16A satellite.
Furthermore, EUTELSAT has also agreed to provide us with certain discounts as well as a certain
amount of free additional satellite capacity from the MPEG 4 launch date until 2024.

We also provide satellite services in Bulgaria, including uplink and downlink of radio and TV channels,
playout solutions, fixed and mobile VSAT data connectivity, collocation of satellite equipment and
other services. In addition to being a third-party teleport of EUTELSAT, in Bulgaria we also partner
with Intelsat, SES, Gazprom, Azercosmos and Hellas Sat. Our satellite services offering includes video
uplink services on various satellites, Playout Solution as a Service (PSS), a cloud based service
including playout hardware located at Vivacom’s technical facilities and an IP based tool for content
management, VSAT data links. All of this ensures higher data rates, optimized cost for the customer,
better flexibility and reliability, and are mainly targeted at the maritime business, as well as fixed VSAT
links for corporate networks, in rural areas and as a backup solution and satellite collocation services.

In Bulgaria we also own and operate one of the biggest and most modern facilities for satellite
communications in the region—Plana Teleport, which is able to deliver transmission and connectivity
even to very remote points, including orbital positions in Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia. Since
2014, Plana Teleport is a member of the World Teleport Association and in August 2021 achieved full
Tier 4 certification, making it among the most modern facilities of its kind. In addition, we operate a
microwave IP based network connecting main sites in Bulgaria. We use a microwave network for
delivery of DTT signal and Bulgarian national radio channels to the main TV towers. The microwave
network is monitored and controlled 24/7 by the National Operations Center.

_Mobile_

In Slovenia, our mobile network is currently fully IP enabled, with single radio access network
technology (“SRAN”) providing full services on 2G, 3G and 4G networks. We currently provide 4G


-----

(LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage to approximately 99% and 98%, respectively, of the Slovenian
population. In 2020, we added 54 additional mobile sites to our footprint. In 2021, we expect to launch
a total of 55 new sites in Slovenia, which we expect will lead to 4G (LTE) and 4G+ (LTE-A) coverage
for approximately 99% of the Slovenian population. The technology upgrades and new sites are
expected to increase our coverage in Slovenia, amplify our network capacity and enhance customer
experience. In April 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Slovenia for 5G frequency bands
and commenced commercial deployment of 5G in Slovenia in June 2021.

Having successfully launched our 4G service, we also cover all major cities and important roads in
Croatia. In addition, we have acquired 2100MHz and 2600MHz frequencies to support spectrum
capacity. In July 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Croatia for 5G frequencies, and
commenced deployment and commercial launch of our 5G C-Band in September 2021.

In Bulgaria, we offer mobile services through Vivacom’s integrated 2G, 3G and 4G/LTE network. In
2018, Vivacom launched a 4G voice service (Voice over LTE) and Wi Fi calling services, which enable
its customers to benefit from high definition voice services. On September 21, 2020, we announced the
commercial launch of our 5G network in Bulgaria, and to that end in May 2021, we secured a 20-year
license for 100 MHz spectrum frequencies in the 3.6 GHz band. To scale the development of our 5G
network quickly, we use dynamic spectrum sharing on our existing 4G network, enabling us to provide
5G coverage to all 27 district cities in Bulgaria. Other than its 5G network, Vivacom’s network is based
on: GSM/EDGE (2G technologies), UMTS/HSPA+ (3G technologies) and LTE/LTE-Advanced
(4G/4.5G technologies).

As of September 30, 2021, our GSM mobile network, our UMTS mobile network and our LTE network
each covered approximately 100% of the Bulgarian population. Vivacom’s licenses allow it to use
2x11.2 MHz on the 900 MHz spectrum band, 2x15MHz on the 1800 MHz spectrum band and 2x15MHz
on the 2100 MHz spectrum band.

As of September 30, 2021, our mobile network in Bulgaria is supported by a portfolio of 3,675 tower
sites across Bulgaria, of which 42% have fiber backhauling. As of the same date, we covered over 681
networks by roaming agreements with other Bulgarian and international operators around the world.

We have approximately 4,700 mobile towers in Bulgaria, Slovenia and Croatia, which we estimate have
collectively impacted Run-Rate Last Two-Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDAaL for September 30,
2021, by approximately €55-60 million.

Mobile Network Evolution

During 2021, we entered into two global framework agreements for the provision of equipment and
services for our mobile networks in Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia that are material to the evolution
and upkeep of our mobile networks, including commercial implementation of next generation 5G
capabilities.

- _Mobile Radio Network Equipment Agreement_

We entered into a global frame agreement with Huawei International Co. Limited (“Huawei”) for the
supply of radio network equipment for our mobile networks, which was effective as of April 16, 2021.
The duration of the contract is five years, subject to renewal and extension. Pursuant to the terms of the
contract, we agreed to purchase, and with the assistance of Huawei install and operate certain radio
equipment, receive spare parts, reuse certain legacy equipment and use or license certain other items
from Huawei upon certain agreed terms and subject to certain conditions. Entry into this global frame
agreement is a continuation of our existing work with Huawei, which we believe we have at all times
conducted in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

- _Mobile Core Network Elements Agreement_


-----

As part of a strategy to consolidate our core network vendors, we also entered into a global frame
agreement with Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy as of June 17, 2021, for the supply, installation,
commissioning, migration, support and network evolution of mobile core network elements for our
mobile networks. The contract has a duration of five years, subject to renewal and extension. The
contract sets out the terms and conditions pursuant to which the agreed equipment and services will be
supplied during duration of the contract.

_Network Maintenance_

We introduced a new preventative maintenance platform in 2016 to monitor our network by
categorizing and ranking the nodes across our network and providing guidance about which system
maintenance works are most needed, which has improved both our network quality and customer
satisfaction experience. Furthermore, our internal maintenance regime is also stricter than industry
standards.

Vivacom made significant investments into its network over the last few years, and we plan to continue
the build out of its fiber network in carefully selected areas based on specific return on investment
criteria. We also intend to invest further in Vivacom’s fixed network, including MPLS and Metro
networks, and the fixed access network, as well as the mobile core and access networks supported by
new spectrum frequencies and microwave licenses for transmission.

**Licenses and Permits**

We believe that we hold substantially all necessary authorization and licenses to provide our services.
The descriptions below summarize the licensing and permit framework for each of our seven operating
jurisdictions.

_Slovenia Group segment. To be authorized to operate as media and telecommunications service provider_
in Slovenia, we notified AKOS by providing a short description of its public communication network
and its services. We were subsequently included on the official register as a service provider and has
secured several radio and mobile frequency licenses.

See also “—Regulatory Framework,” “—Legal Proceedings—Litigation Matters Relating to Telemach
_Slovenia (as Successor to Tušmobil),” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and_
_Industry—We do not hold valid use permits for parts of our cable network.”_

_Serbia Group segment. Pursuant to the law on electronic communications, an operator of media and_
telecommunications services is not required to obtain a license for its general services. In order to
provide its services, an operator must submit a request for registration to the RATEL, which SBB Serbia
did in 2011.

_Bosnia Group segment. We hold licenses for the distribution of audiovisual media services and radio_
media services in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are valid for ten years and will expire on December
31, 2026. These licenses can be extended by submitting a request to the Bosnian regulator at least threemonths before expiration. We also hold licenses to operate a public electronic communications network
and provide fixed-line telephone services which are valid for an unlimited duration. We also hold a
license for the use of telephone numbers and pre-code numbers, the validity of which is tied to the
validity of the license for the provision of fixed-line telephone services, as well as an ISP (internet
service provider) license, which is valid for an unlimited duration.

_Montenegro Group segment. We hold licenses for the distribution of audiovisual media services and_
radio media services in Montenegro issued by the agency for electronic media, which are valid for
fifteen years and will expire in 2032. In addition, we are registered in the register of operators held by
the Agency for Electronic Communications and Postal Activity (“EKIP”) as an operator of public fixed
electronic communication networks and services (internet access, fixed-telephony and internet voice


-----

transmission services (VoIP)). Furthermore, we hold licenses issued by EKIP for specific numerations
and addresses, which are valid for ten years.

_Bulgaria Group segment. We hold all necessary permits to operate our business in Bulgaria. In_
particular, our permits allow us to use 2x11.2 MHz on the 900 MHz spectrum band, 2x15MHz on the
1800 MHz spectrum band and 2x15MHz on the 2100 MHz spectrum band, as well as 100 MHz

2041, respectively and may be renewed thereafter through an application to the CRC. The renewal is
within the discretion of the CRC which, when reviewing the application, considers factors such as
consumers’ interests, the competitive environment and the effective policy on scarce resources. Our
fixed-line services in Bulgaria are provided pursuant to a permit obtained from the CRC, which is valid
until 2024.

_Greece Group segment. We hold permits for the operation of our business in Greece. We are a licensed_
electronic communication service provider and holders permits for, among other things, the provision
of fixed, mobile (MVNO) and satellite (virtual) electronic communications networks, leased lines,
broadband and internet access services, telephony services, capacity and interconnection services, VPN
services, data transmission and radio communications services. We also hold licenses for the use of
specific spectrum frequencies (e.g., for the provision of wireless access services). Nova Broadcasting
SA (formerly Forthnet Media SA), a subsidiary of Nova, holds a license for the provision of Pay-TV
services through satellite, which was issued by the National Council for Radio & Television. Nova
Broadcasting SA is also a licensed electronic communication service provider and holds permits for the
operation and provision of fixed and satellite electronic communications service networks and data
transmission. Furthermore, Nova Broadcasting SA holds licenses for the use of specific spectrum
frequencies (e.g., for the provision of wireless access services). Such permits and licensing are regulated
by the National Telecommunication and Post Authority in Greece.

_Croatia Group segment. We hold all necessary permits to operate our business in Croatia. In particular,_
we hold licenses for the use of mobile radio frequency spectrum and the provision of mobile services,
which will expire in 2024. In July 2021, we secured 15-year spectrum licenses in Croatia for 5G
frequencies, and commenced deployment and commercial launch of our 5G C-Band in September 2021.

**Information Technology**

We operate a modern information technology (“IT”) infrastructure in order to support our business. Our
IT systems are generally managed in house, and also receive external support from manufacturers and
suppliers. Our IT system consists of the following key segments: our operations support system
(“OSS”), which supports our back office activities, including the operation of our network and provision
and maintenance of our customer service; our business support system (“BSS”), which supports our
customer facing activities such as billing, order management and our call center; and our mediation and
provisioning system which monitors and facilitates subscribers’ network access rights and privileges to
ensure the security of our resources and user privacy.

In early 2017, Telemach Slovenia implemented SAP platforms, joining SBB Serbia and Telemach BH
which had already implemented SAP platforms, and thus further facilitating integration. In 2021 the
same platform was implemented in Telemach Croatia and we are currently working on the roll-out for
Nova Greece. Our OSS stack is managed and developed internally, based on a standardized platform.

In Bulgaria, we have a well-developed and growing IT environment with a focus on automation and
digital presence. Vivacom’s IT systems provide high levels of automation for the majority of the
business in both BSS and OSS and are the main pillar in the digitalization process. The OSS stack
architecture is built to enable an end-to-end service fulfillment process, working together with the BSS
stack. It supports automated provisioning and assurance processes for mass services including B2C
mobile voice and data, fixed voice and data, IPTV and satellite TV and also combined services. The
BSS stack has been transformed to boost Vivacom’s omni channel strategy. Applications supporting


-----

online channels, physical shops, distant sales channels and third-party integration capabilities are
integrated with single product and offer catalog and order management. All channels are powered by
big data analytics and real time marketing offerings.

In Greece, our IT infrastructure consists of technologies for designing, developing and creating tools to
support the business operations of Nova, including virtualization, and modern hardware such as data
storage, servers, security systems and network equipment from vendors such as HP, IBM and Dell. We
also use software that is open-source or commercial for monitoring and managing its OSS systems, as
well as applications for supporting BSS systems, either developed in-house or purchased through
leading software vendors such as SAP and Oracle.

We have established our own security operations center (“SOC”) team, which is fully equipped in terms
of necessary technology and consists of trained operators to monitor and triage incidents at all times,
while further incident response is performed by engineers and cybersecurity analysts. We will continue
to focus on integrating and streamlining the different IT systems to standardize and further improve our
IT solutions.

**Competition**

We face competition from established market participants as well as new market entrants. The nature
and level of the competition we face varies for each of the products and services we offer and for each
country in which we operate. Despite regional differences in the intensity of competition, we compete
in each case on the basis of network quality, content advantage, product and service portfolio
specifications, value for money proposition, marketing, installation speeds and customer care.

Our competitors include, but are not limited to, providers of television, broadband internet, fixedtelephony services using DSL or fiber connections and mobile-telephony operators, including Telekom
Slovenije, Telekom Austria and T2 in Slovenia, Telekom Srbija and Super Nova in Serbia, A1 Bulgaria,
Telenor Bulgaria and Bulsatcom in Bulgaria, BH Telecom, HT Eronet and Mtel in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, OTE (Cosmote) and Vodafone Greece in Greece and M Tel and Crnogorski Telekom in
Montenegro. We also compete against DTH providers, including Digi and Polaris, and DTT providers
in Slovenia. Furthermore, we face competition from providers of television services using alternative
and emerging digital technologies such as IPTV and OTT television. Our Shoppster e-commerce
offering also competes with, among others, e-commerce platforms such as E Kupi in Serbia and
Mimovrste, EnaA, Big Bang, Merkur and Piazz (recently launched by Telekom Slovenije) in Slovenia,
as well as traditional retail stores such as Gigatron and Tehnomanija in Serbia. We also compete with
other sources of news, information and entertainment such as social media platforms, newspapers,
movie theatres, live sporting and music events, computer games and home video products. Please also
see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The cable television, broadband
_internet, DTH and telephony markets in the regions in which we operate are highly competitive.”_

**Property and Equipment**

Our principal asset is our network, which consists of numerous cables, telecommunications
installations, including exchanges of various sizes and transmission equipment. See “—Network.”

We lease the headquarters of SBB Serbia in Belgrade, Serbia, as well as SBB Serbia’s technical center
in Belgrade and several other office spaces throughout the country. We also lease the headquarters of
Telemach BH and other minor offices and sales facilities throughout the markets in which we operate.
Additionally, we own most of the equipment needed for our core operations, including the sites housing
network hubs. In Slovenia, we purchased Tušmobil’s headquarters in 2015 and relocated most of our
operations to this location.

In Bulgaria, we own or lease property essential for our business operations. We own, lease or have other
rights to use or construct on the sites where Vivacom’s mobile and fixed-line telecommunications


-----

network equipment is installed. We also own and lease administrative facilities, operational network
facilities and retail facilities throughout Bulgaria.

In Greece, we own an office building in Kallithea and another in Athens and lease two other office
buildings in Athens, one of which serves as the headquarters of Nova. We also lease or have other rights
to use or construct on the sites where Nova’s fixed-line telecommunications network equipment is
installed.

We believe that our properties and equipment are in good condition and are suitable and adequate for
our business operations. None of our significant properties are subject to material easements or other
third-party proprietary interests that prevent or restrict the current business activities or that are believed
to require major investments or costs going forward.

**Focus on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) Matters**

As we have grown our Group, we have increased our emphasis on integrating ESG considerations into
the key aspects of our operations, including our decision-making and reporting processes, with Boardlevel oversight and accountability. To that end, in 2020, we established a dedicated ESG coordinator
role within the Group. We have also established a multi-disciplinary team of senior executives who,
together with independent consultants, finalized in 2020 a detailed ESG action plan and implementation
roadmap. While more than half of our Group (by revenue) already produces ESG reports, we are
working to expand our current reporting, procedures, products and activities, and are developing a
framework to better identify and address ESG considerations using, among other standards, the
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) materiality matrix for telecommunications and
media. Our main goal is to provide fast and reliable connections to information, knowledge and
entertainment, which in itself represents the infrastructure of the modern world on which many of the
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are based.

As part of our continued development in this area, the following are key focus areas and associated
KPIs, which we are using to improve upon existing practices and set and exceed new goals for ESG
matters.

- **Environmental sustainability. To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we**
are taking active steps to minimize our environmental footprint, while also collecting and
analyzing Group historical data to set future KPI targets for reductions in carbon emissions,
climate change policy, energy use and energy sourcing. As part of our commitment to the Paris
Climate Accords, we have committed to the Science Based Targets initiative and the Carbon
Disclosure Projects, which help to drive climate action in the private sector by enabling
companies to set emissions reduction targets with scientific data and to that end we have also
submitted a net-zero target in line with a “1.5° future.” During our data gathering, we
determined that electricity represents the greatest source (approximately 86%) and opportunity
for the reduction of carbon emissions by switching to clean energy. We focus on promoting
environmental sustainability through the use of renewable energy, reducing scrap waste,
recycling and other strategies. We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across
our offices and infrastructure and ultimately make all of our operations carbon-neutral. In 2019,
we established a solar power plant at our business premises in Slovenia with a nominal power
of 242 kW, which generated 232.61 MWh of electricity in 2020, equal to approximately 1% of
our yearly consumption. We have leveraged our experience in this project to look for additional
green energy projects which could cover a significant part of our carbon emission footprint,
such as our investment in a wind park in Bulgaria, with 70 MW of power and 238 GWh annual
production. In 2020, we consumed 295.5 GWh of energy generated from all sources and we
generated 232.6 MWh of renewable energy from our solar plant in Slovenia. In addition, we
use electric vehicles in our operations where feasible, and we work to exchange old, less-energy
efficient equipment for more energy efficient devices. In 2020, we generated approximately
128.1 thousand tons of CO2 emissions (9.3 thousand tons of scope 1 emissions and 118.8


-----

thousand tons of scope 2 and 3 emissions), including the contribution of acquired companies,
and we target to reduce these by approximately 60%, or 50.6 thousand tons, by 2030. We are
also committed to reducing the climate footprint of our customers by facilitating access to
information, connectivity and entertainment by means of our high speed network, which
provides an incentive to reduce their need to travel. Furthermore, as the rapid development of
broadband, television and IT technology necessitates the continual replacement of legacy
network elements and the upgrading of our networks to accommodate increased bandwidth
requirements and new services, we have introduced waste management procedures, and we
regularly recycle obsolete equipment. In 2020, we recycled 1,539 tons of network telecom
equipment, batteries, cables, paper and cardboard. We are also committed to minimizing waste
and we repurpose, reuse or recycle 100% of returned customer devices and accessories and aim
to extend our products’ end-of-life cycle. Certain of our larger telecommunications operations
either have achieved or are pursuing ISO 14001:2015 certification, a global standard for
environmental management. We also recognize the importance of responsible procurement and
supply chain management, and to that end, we have developed Group-level procurement
policies to align procurement activities across Group companies, including adding
environmental factors in our request for proposals when engaging with new suppliers. Our
procurement procedure includes multiple checks and verification requirements, such as
international sanctions and reputation risk evaluation.

To promote environmental sustainability in our operations, we expect each of our operating
company to (i) comply with all applicable legal requirements and group-wide environmental
policy, (ii) implement appropriate control, including specific environmental procedures, (iii)
implement an environment-focused management structure, (iv) commit to reduce energy and
fuel consumption, as well as business travel and associated greenhouse gas emissions, (v)
commit to the efficient use of resources and materials used for packaging and products to reduce
waste, (vi) commit to a circular economic model, and (viii) provide selected employees with
the relevant environmental management training to undertake their duties and responsibilities
effectively.

- **Community engagement. We actively support the communities in which we operate, and in**
2020, we named a Group-level director for corporate social responsibility to coordinate efforts
in this regard among our operating companies. At an operational level, our Group companies
exercise significant control over their own community engagement projects due to the
particularities of each company, country and culture. However, the activities of our Group
companies are guided by a common set of priorities that include education, environment and
health, and community relief. We have as a Group donated €4.7 million in 2020 and €1.1
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, to groups and activities dedicated to
protecting the environment, education and the socially vulnerable, including donations of
personal protective equipment to help fight COVID-19. We have also fostered digital
inclusivity by engaging in multiple community engagement activities in the past few years,
with a focus on using our platform to deliver knowledge to children (including programs for
online safety), students, the general public and disadvantaged groups, by leveraging our core
competencies in broadband internet and other telecommunications. For 2022, we aim to
increase the percentage of staff participating in a community engagement activity (e.g.,
volunteering time or knowledge), which in 2021 stood at 7% (excluding United Media). As part
of our obligations to protect customer data, we are aligning our Group data protection policies
to standardize processes and continue our track record of no fines since GDPR came into force.
We do this via regular training programs, penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of our
IT systems, with some of our Group companies having obtained ISO/IEC 27001:2013
certification as well.

- **Corporate and employee responsibility. We focus on building a safe, fair and inclusive**
working environment for our employees. To inform our social management targets, we collect
data on our workforce, such as gender mix (57% male, 43% female), percentage of women in


-----

management positions (32%, including our Chief Executive Officer) and percentage of disabled
employees (1%), in each case, as of September 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021, staff total turnover is 17% and we have experienced 69 workplace injury
incidents. We aim to improve these metrics throughout 2021. In particular, we track gender
equality KPIs with the aim of ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal
opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public
life. We also have mandated diversity and inclusion rules and have documented these in
employee manuals at our Group companies, which include, among others, statutory
requirements related to workers’ rights and human rights (e.g., anti-discrimination and antimobbing) and annual employee Net Promoter Score (“eNPS”) measurements. To facilitate
further transparency and accountability, we plan to expand our anonymous suggestion boxes
already present in certain of our Group companies and establish whistle-blowing programs as
a distinct transparency function. We also offer training programs to employees which are
focused on improving job-related technical and management skills, as well as on compliance
with our internal policies. We have established internal training centers which manage the entire
training process from on-boarding to organizing advanced technical and management education
provided by external experts. In 2020, we began an ambitious eNPS training program, which
we plan to continue in 2021. During this period, we invested approximately 40 hours of training
per employee for new hires and 10 hours per existing employee across our telecommunication
operating companies. Our eNPS training efforts and other initiatives contributed to a significant
increase of 46 points in eNPS score from 2019 to 2020, and it currently averages at +10. In
addition, we have been developing a specific code of conduct, which includes elements related
to labor standards, particularly to health and safety and relevant International Labour
Organisation standards. We expect to introduce our code of conduct across all of our companies
in the first half of 2022, in order to harmonize the existing processes and standards already in
place at some of our Group companies.

- **Shareholder support for ESG development. As we continue to make progress in ESG**
matters, we are wholly supported in our efforts by our majority shareholder, BC Partners. BC
Partners is a primary signatory to the United Nations’ Principles of Responsible Investments,
adopting these principles in 2009. BC Partners has formalized its commitment to increased
standards in its own ESG strategy, and takes an active role in improving ESG awareness,
performance and compliance with us and its other portfolio companies.

**Employees**

As of September 30, 2021, we employed 14,347 employees (13,542 full-time equivalent) across the
Netherlands Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia
and Montenegro. The following table shows the number of full-time equivalent employees as of
September 30, 2021, by category:

**As of**

-----

We believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. During the last three years, we have
not experienced any strikes or work outages, and currently we know of 610 of our employees are
members of a labor union (Nova’s labor union does not provide us with access to their lists of registered
members).

**Insurance**

Our fixed assets such as technical and office equipment in our network operating centers, network hubs,
head ends and office locations are protected by insurance policies covering damage from fire and other
catastrophes. We also have separate insurance covering losses from machinery breakdown and
insurance for interruption and operating costs. While we have no insurance against the risk of failure
by subscribers to pay, we have alternative controls to mitigate this risk, including collection processes
and arrangements with collections agencies. We provide directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for
all members of our board of directors, as well as certain other persons within our Group.

We believe that our existing insurance coverage, including the amounts of coverage and the conditions
thereto, provides reasonable protection, taking into account the costs for the insurance coverage and the
potential risks to business operations. However, we cannot guarantee that no losses will be incurred or
that claims that go beyond the type and scope of the existing insurance coverage will not be filed against
it.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Other than as discussed below, we do not expect the
legal proceedings in which we are involved or with which we have been threatened to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or profitability. The outcome of legal proceedings, however,
can be extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and no assurance can be offered in this regard.

**_Criminal Matters Related to Telemach Slovenia (as successor to Tušmobil)_**

Certain criminal matters are still pending against Tušmobil’s (as Telemach’s Slovenia’s predecessor)
former owner Mirko Tuš and the former head of AKOS, Tomaž Simonič. Pursuant to a bill of indictment
that was filed in March 2015 (and amended in May 2019) by the public prosecutor in connection with
these criminal matters, which were initially instigated by Tušmobil’s competitors in 2008, it is alleged
that, among other things, Tušmobil and Mirko Tuš made illegal payments to Tomaž Simonič, a former
head of AKOS, to obtain the grant of a block of 2x5 MHz of spectrum in the 2100 MHz band in 2008.
The bill of indictment filed by the public prosecutor also challenges AKOS’ decision in 2006 to allow
Tušmobil to exchange a certain radio frequency band (1,800 MHz) for another band (900 MHz) at no
charge and without obtaining the views of other interested parties. It is also alleged that Tušmobil and
Mirko Tuš made illegal payments to the former head of AKOS to obtain the exchange of frequencies at
no cost. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, Telemach Slovenia as a legal entity has been
found free of criminal liability (with the effect of finality) and related exposure to penalties or fines.
However, as a beneficiary of the frequencies grant, Telemach Slovenia may be jointly and severally
liable with other defendants (against which proceedings are still pending) for indemnification of the
allegedly illegally gained benefit if any of the remaining defendants are found guilty. In February 2020,
the first instance court acquitted Mr. Simonič of the charges in the amended bill of indictment (misuse
of the public positions or rights). In December 2020, upon the public prosecutor’s appeal, the Higher
Court of Ljubljana annulled this judgment and returned the case to the first instance court for retrial.
The criminal proceedings against Mirko Tuš have been from time to time separated from the other trials
and may be conducted separately.

In January 2016, the Republic of Slovenia made a claim against Mirko Tuš and Telemach Slovenia for
indemnification in an amount of €7.2 million. During the pre-trial hearings, Telemach Slovenia
contested the grounds for, and challenged the amount of, this claim. While the bill of indictment filed


-----

by the public prosecutor in March 2015 had indicated that Tušmobil allegedly illegally gained benefit
in an amount of approximately €7.2 million, representing a valuation of the potential charge for the
frequency bands under challenge, which had been estimated by an expert appointed by the court for
such purpose, Telemach Slovenia has contested and opposed, and intends to continue to contest and
oppose this valuation.

If any payment obligation is imposed against Telemach Slovenia or the criminal procedure is closed
with any other negative impact in these matters, we, in turn, could seek to recover these amounts from
Tušmobil’s seller based on certain provisions set forth in the transaction documents that we have entered
into with Tušmobil’s seller. For instance, under the share sale and purchase agreement, we have
recourse to up to €168 million in indemnification from the seller for losses arising from breaches of
warranties related to financial crime, which we could seek to claim against in the event of a final, nonappealable judgment requiring Tušmobil to pay monetary fines or in the case of a negative impact to
the conduct of business, reputation and assets of Telemach Slovenia resulting from the criminal
procedure. However, we may not be successful in any actions to claim indemnity or damages from
Tušmobil’s seller in a timely manner or at all, and the indemnifying party may not have sufficient funds
to fulfil its indemnification obligations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and
_Industry—We have made and may make acquisitions or enter into asset dispositions or other_
_transactions that may present unforeseen risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals_
_that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with_
_the integration of any acquisitions.”_

The AKOS criminal proceedings described above relate to the block of spectrum obtained by Tušmobil
in 2008 (and the exchange of certain frequency bands in 2006), and do not affect the ownership or
validity of the spectrum used for 4G/LTE and legacy 2G that Tušmobil was awarded in 2014 (for the
period from 2014 to 2029) or the ownership or validity of the additional 3G and 4G/LTE frequencies
allotted to Telemach Slovenia in 2016 (for periods until 2021 and 2031) or the recently acquired
spectrum at the auction in April 2021. Nevertheless, if the pending criminal proceedings are determined
in a manner adverse to Telemach Slovenia, and Telemach Slovenia is required to pay a material amount
as part of an indemnity, and Telemach Slovenia is not able to recover such amounts from the Tušmobil
seller, such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and
profitability.

**_Investment Arbitration with Serbia_**

On October 6, 2020, we, together with two of our affiliates, served the Republic of Serbia with a Notice
of Dispute under the agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between
the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Serbia (“BIT”). In such Notice of Dispute, it was
asserted that Serbia breached several obligations under the BIT, including, among others, the obligation
to accord fair and equitable treatment, national treatment and most constant protection and security. We
argued that, beginning in 2014, we have been a target of a series of arbitrary, unlawful measures taken
by various Serbian authorities and entities as part of a widespread, orchestrated campaign to reduce
SBB Serbia’s market presence and to promote the interests of Telekom Srbija.

The Republic of Serbia failed to respond to the Notice of Dispute within the three-month deadline
established by the BIT. On January 7, 2021, we submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. An arbitration proceeding was initiated and is currently
ongoing. On December 30, 2021, the arbitral tribunal dismissed Serbia’s request for bifurcation.

**_Investigation by the Serbian Tax Authority_**

On December 27, 2018, the Serbian Tax Authority notified us that it had begun a tax investigation of
SBB Serbia for the year ended December 31, 2012. In March 2019, the Serbian Tax Authority issued a
decision that it had recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan
agreement (and certain other transactions) as dividends, the payments of which would have been subject


-----

to a 5% withholding tax. The total contingent liability under this decision amounts to €21 million,
including late interest. We have assessed these matters internally and through external consultants, and
it is our view that there is no basis for the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision. We have appealed to the
Serbian Ministry of Finance and received a prolongation of our obligation to pay any amounts until
resolution of the appeal. We have also submitted a request for a mutual agreement procedure (“MAP”)
for our Dutch entities to the Dutch Ministry of Finance on the basis that the Serbian taxation decision
is not in compliance with the double taxation treaty between the Netherlands and Serbia. The Dutch
Ministry of Finance has notified the Serbian Tax Authority of the MAP procedure. The Dutch Ministry
of Finance has also submitted a letter to the Serbian Ministry of Finance stating that Serbia has
misclassified the interest payments and is in breach of the bilateral double taxation treaty. On October
12, 2020, the Serbian Ministry of Finance annulled the Serbian Tax Authority’s decision and instructed
the Serbian Tax Authority to restart the procedure, taking into account the arguments provided in SBB
Serbia’s appeal.

The Serbian Tax Authority also informed SBB Serbia that it is opening a tax review for the years 2013
through 2016. SBB Serbia intends to continue contesting the Serbian Tax Authority’s findings. See
“Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may be adversely affected by changes
_to tax legislation or its interpretation or increases in effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which it_
_operates, or challenges to our tax position.”_

**_Dispute with Minority Shareholders of KATV HS d.o.o. and HKB net d.o.o._**

We assumed a number of legal disputes in connection with our acquisition of KATV HS d.o.o. (“HS”),
HKB net d.o.o. (“HKB”) and M&H Company d.o.o. (“M&H”) as part of the Bosnian Acquisitions in
2015. Specifically, we assumed certain claims brought by the minority shareholder of both HS and
HKB, most of which claims have been brought against HS and HKB, as well as their former majority
shareholders and former management. These include certain claims asserted in a civil lawsuit brought
in the period from 2013 to 2015 seeking damages relating to alleged breaches of contractual and/or
statutory duties by HS, HKB, M&H, the former majority shareholder and the former management of
these companies. The aggregate amount claimed by the minority shareholder in these cases is
approximately €12.2 million, plus interest and costs of the proceedings. These claims are in the
preliminary stages of litigation, and no final, enforceable decision will be rendered until the claims have
been adjudicated by both the court of first instance and (if appealed) the secondary appellate court. It is
difficult to estimate the final amount of damages (which will, in due course, be subject to valuation by
an expert appointed by the court) and when such adjudication would be completed.

In June 2015, the minority shareholder of HS and HKB also brought a civil lawsuit seeking to annul
Telemach BH’s purchase of HS and HKB. Specifically, the minority shareholder contended that it was
not provided with sufficient information to allow it to determine whether to exercise its statutory right
of first refusal relating to the sale of HS and HKB. This claim is still in the preliminary stages. The
aggregate purchase price paid for the acquisition of HS and HKB as approximately €7 million. The
minority shareholder has also brought a number of additional claims against HS, HKB and M&H
relating to the corporate decision by which certain business opportunities were transferred to M&H
from HS and HKB, allegedly undertaken by the former majority shareholder of these companies. While
we do not believe that these claims are well-founded, we have nonetheless out of an abundance of
caution suspended the contracts for which these claims were initiated.

The minority shareholder has also filed a criminal complaint with the office of the public prosecutor in
Bosnia and Herzegovina alleging criminal wrongdoing by the former majority shareholder and former
management of these companies. This proceeding is still in the investigative phase, and no indictment
or other criminal charge has been filed. The status of, and information relating to, criminal
investigations generally in Bosnia and Herzegovina are not publicly available.

**_Disputes with SAZAS Relating to Infringement of Copyrights_**


-----

Since 2012, we have been involved in numerous court procedures regarding payment of copyright fees
for cable retransmission of musical copyright works on retransmitted TV and radio channels to the
Slovenian Association of Composers and Authors (“SAZAS”), the collective copyrights protection
organization, in the aggregate amount of approximately €3.2 million, plus late payment interest and
legal costs.

The proceedings are at different stages, as the proceedings that began in 2012 and 2016, and some of
the proceedings that began in 2018 and 2019, are currently being considered by the Constitutional Court,
while some of the proceedings that were initiated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 are pending before either the
first instance court or the Higher Court. In all of the pending cases, United Group has filed legal
challenges to any adverse decisions of the courts. Where the court decisions issued in the respective
proceedings have already become final, we have paid the amounts adjudicated by the courts, while in
July 2021 we have also paid the most commonly adjudicated amount per user for 2016 to mitigate the
accrual of the late payment interest.

On March 4, 2021, the Copyright Board in Slovenia issued its decision setting a tariff for the use of
musical works at €0.24 per subscriber per month for retransmission of up to 100 television and 60 radio
channels, and €0.27 per subscriber per month for retransmission of more than 100 television and 60
radio channels. The decision is not final yet as all parties of the proceeding (including the Association
of cable operators in Slovenia, an economic interest association of which we are a member) are
challenging the Copyright Board decision in court.

**_Dispute with Copyright Institute_**

On April 28, 2021, the Copyright Institute, an organization representing four Slovenian broadcasters
(NovaTV24.si d.d., Pro TV d.o.o., TV 3 d.o.o. and Topstream d.o.o.), filed a claim against Telemach
Slovenia for €9.7 million in allegedly unpaid license fees for broadcasting their TV channels, increased
by civil penalty and late interest. The plaintiff argues that under Slovenian law, Telemach Slovenia is
required to carry the relevant channels and must pay them fees proportional to those that it pays to other
channels. We consider this claim to be unfounded and against EU rules applicable to “must-carry”
programming. This case is pending.

**_Dispute with BS Group d.o.o., Brus in Regard to Producer’s Rights_**

In 2016, BS GROUP DOO BRUS (“BS”) initiated legal proceedings against SBB Serbia before the
Commercial Court in Belgrade claiming damages in the amount of approximately €25 million. BS
claims that SBB Serbia violated BS’s producer rights in respect of certain of its television series and
films by broadcasting them outside of Serbia. SBB Serbia has responded to the claims. Subsequently, a
court expert report dated as of December 6, 2019, concluded that broadcasts had occurred outside of
Serbia. SBB Serbia submitted comments made by its own expert challenging the court expert’s report.
The court conducted expert hearings at the hearing held on September 8, 2021, at which SBB Serbia
submitted a request for the disqualification of the court’s experts. The court rejected SBB Serbia’s
request on September 15, 2021. The main hearing took place on November 15, 2021 and on the same
date, the court issued an interim judgment finding the claims brought by BS to be grounded. Until the
interim judgment becomes final, the court shall suspend any litigation on the amount of damages in
relation to the claims. SBB Serbia maintains its position that the claims are groundless and has appealed
the interim judgment.

**_Sport Klub Divestiture Ruling_** **_and Investigation of Alleged Abuse of Dominant Position_**

On September 4, 2018, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency ruled that our acquisition of
United Media Distribution (then known as IKO Balkan) in 2012 was incompatible with Slovenian
competition rules. The Slovenian Competition Protection Agency also ordered us to divest the activity
of broadcasting the Sport Klub (SK) TV channels within six months and imposed a ban prohibiting us
from broadcasting sports TV channels in Slovenia (with the exception of the existing Fight Channel)


-----

for the period of three years from the day we transfer the Sport Klub (SK) TV channels to a suitable
buyer. The activity of broadcasting Sport Klub (SK) TV channels includes purchasing rights for
transmitting audiovisual sport TV content for Sport Klub (SK) TV channels, producing Sport Klub (SK)
TV channels and offering Sport Klub (SK) TV channels to operators in the wholesale TV channel
market, in each case, limited to the territory of Slovenia. The Slovenian Supreme Court stayed the
implementation of the Slovenian Competition Protection Authority’s divestment decision until a final
decision on the merits of this case is issued. With a judgment dated May 21, 2020, the administrative
court annulled the decision of the Competition Protection Agency and ordered the Agency to restart the
concentration assessment procedure. On October 28, 2021, the Competition Protection Agency cleared
the transaction without any commitments.

In relation to this proceeding, the Slovenian Competition Protection Authority in a separate
misdemeanor proceeding imposed a fine of €3.7 million on United Media Limited for a delayed merger
control filing. We challenged this fine before the administrative court. On January 11, 2021, the
administrative court ruled that the fine should be reduced to €1.56 million. We appealed this ruling and
requested a further reduction in the amount of the fine, which appeal is pending.

Additionally, a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of our annual revenue could be imposed on us in
a separate misdemeanor proceeding for not having obtained merger clearance prior to operating IKO
Balkan. In previous decisions when the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency has, following or in
parallel with granting merger clearance, levied fines against companies for exercising control prior to
obtaining merger clearance, the percentage of such fines ordered has been materially less than 10% of
the annual group revenue. Particularly, in an unrelated recent case, the Slovenian Competition
Protection Agency fined an undertaking for failure to provide notification of a concentration in the
amount of approximately €54 million, which, according to publicly available sources, amounted to
approximately 1% of the relevant group’s annual revenue, and such fine was subsequently reduced by
the County Court of Ljubljana to €1 million.

In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated an investigation regarding
alleged abuse of dominant position by United Media Limited, IKO Balkan (now known as United Media
Distribution) and its former Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. in the wholesale market for
the supply of pay-TV sports channels in Slovenia for a period beginning around August 2012. This
investigative proceeding is currently pending as no statement of objections has been issued by the
Slovenian Competition Protection Agency. Possible impacts of a decision adverse to us include: (i) an
obligation to cease the infringement (if any); (ii) imposition of measures to remedy any proven abuse
of dominant position; (iii) imposition of a monetary fine of up to 10% of the annual turnover of United
Media Limited and United Media Distribution in the preceding business year; (iv) the imposition of a
criminal charge; and (v) damages claims from third parties. We cannot predict the outcome of this
proceeding, and we can offer no assurances as to the effects of a decision adverse to us.

**_RTS_**

RTS, the plaintiff, requested judicial determination of whether a breach of their rights as the
broadcasting manufacturer of certain RTS channels (RTS 1, RTS 2, RTS 3 and RTS HD) had occurred
due to distribution of these channels by SBB Serbia via EON. RTS claimed approximately €1.5 million
in damages and a temporary injunction seeking to prohibit SBB Serbia from broadcasting the plaintiff’s
programs. The Serbian Law on Electronic Media categorizes RTS programs as “must carry” channels
which all media operators in Serbia are obligated to carry, regardless of what platforms operators
employ in their distribution. On February 26, 2019, the trial court determined a breach of RTS’ rights
as the broadcasting manufacturer had occurred and prohibited SBB Serbia from distributing RTS
programs via EON but denied the claim for damages. The trial court also dismissed SBB Serbia’s
counterclaim for a determination that SBB Serbia is permitted to broadcast and distribute RTS channels.
On January 28, 2021, the Commercial Appellate Court annulled the first instance decision and returned
the case for retrial. The re-trial was concluded on June 1, 2021. However, on June 21, 2021, the court


-----

decided to re-open the main hearing in order to supplement evidentiary proceedings. The proceedings
were closed at the last hearing held on December 8, 2021, and the court is expected to issue its judgment.

RTS filed a further claim against SBB Serbia for distribution of the channels through Total TV, Net TV
Plus, Telemach Montenegro, Telemach Slovenia and Telemach Bosnia and Herzegovina without an
appropriate contract and without paying contributions. RTS claimed approximately €1 million in
damages. This case is pending and the next preliminary hearing is scheduled for February 22, 2022.

**_Beogradske Elektrane_**

Beogradske Elektrane, a public utility company responsible for Belgrade’s power plants, and the City
of Belgrade (collectively, the “BE Plaintiffs”) have filed a claim against SBB Serbia for €10 million,
claiming unjust enrichment based on unauthorized use of their utility ducts for the installation of fiber
optics infrastructure. The BE Plaintiffs have also petitioned the court to declare SBB Serbia’s optical
fiber network an asset of common interest owned by the City of Belgrade. They also seek to impose an
obligation on SBB Serbia to remove the network or to pay the BE Plaintiffs a fee in the amount of €100
million which represents an amount designated by the BE Plaintiffs and, as such, should not be directly
enforceable against SBB Serbia (even in the event the court rules in favor of the BE Plaintiffs) as the
payment thereof represents only an alternative option for SBB Serbia to be allowed to maintain the
network in case the court rules that the network should be removed. A preparatory hearing on this case
was held on September 16, 2021. The next preparatory hearing is scheduled for January 21, 2022.

**_EPS (Serbian Electricity Utility Company)_**

For the construction and maintenance of its network, SBB Serbia entered into contracts with the Serbian
Electricity Utility Company (“EPS”) on the placement of its network infrastructure on utility poles in
different cities in Serbia. Generally, the relevant agreements are entered into for up to one year. The
price under these agreements was initially €10-12.2 per pole per year. However, in late 2018, EPS
increased prices to €20-25 per pole per year. EPS did not provide an adequate reasoning for such a
substantial price increase. In January 2019, SBB Serbia submitted a complaint against these pricing
practices to the Serbian Competition Authority. In June 2019, SBB Serbia submitted a request for joint
usage of EPS infrastructure to RATEL. In October 2019, RATEL granted SBB Serbia the right to jointly
use EPS infrastructure but left the question of pricing open, claiming that if the price offered by EPS is
regulated differently the operators that already signed contracts under such commercial terms would
end up in an unequal position. Both EPS and SBB Serbia challenged RATEL’s decision before the
Administrative Court, and this case is currently pending.

In February 2020, EPS brought a claim against SBB Serbia before the Belgrade Commercial Court for
€1.18 million allegedly due by SBB Serbia for the usage of EPS’s infrastructure. EPS also asked the
Court to order SBB Serbia to remove its equipment from EPS infrastructure. A preliminary hearing was
held on October 14, 2020. At the hearing, SBB Serbia challenged the Court’s jurisdiction and the Court
announced that it would issue a separate ruling on this issue. On November 4, 2020, SBB Serbia
received the Court’s ruling rejecting SBB Serbia’s objections to the Court’s jurisdiction; SBB Serbia
appealed this ruling, but the Commercial Appellate Court rejected the appeal and confirmed the Court’s
ruling. The last hearing was held on November 17, 2021, at which hearing SBB Serbia raised additional
arguments and proposed a new expert report on the reasonable amount which may be charged for use
of EPS’s infrastructure. The Court is yet to decide on this SBB Serbia’s proposal, and the next hearing
is scheduled for February 24, 2022.

**_Litigation relating to Grand Production_**

In October 2020, Saša Mirković, a producer of the Serbian singer, Aleksandar Vuksanović, sued Grand
Production (a subsidiary of United Media) for € 9 million. The plaintiff claims that he entered into an
exclusivity agreement with Mr. Vuksanović and that Grand Production violated that agreement by
making Mr. Vuksanović appear on one of its shows. On October 29, 2020, Grand Production filed its
response to the lawsuit. On April 13, 2021, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and rejected the


-----

plaintiff's request for a preliminary measure filed with the aim to freeze Grand Production’s assets. The
plaintiff appealed this ruling, and the case is now pending in the court of appeals.

**_Unfair competition claims by Telekom Srbija_**

In 2020, Telekom Srbija initiated proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court and Zurich
Commercial Court against several entities belonging to United Group in relation to alleged acts of unfair
competition against the plaintiff. In both proceedings, Telekom Srbija argued that it suffered harm as a
result of defamatory statements allegedly made by the defendants in relation to Telekom Srbija’s
business operations. In its proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court, Telekom Srbija is suing
SBB Serbia, United Media Digital d.o.o. Beograd, Adria News S.à r.l. and United Group B.V., and is
claiming damages of approximately €80 million. In its proceedings before the Zurich Commercial
Court, the plaintiff is suing United Media Network AG, United Group B.V., United Media S.à r.l. and
Adria News S.à r.l., and is claiming damages of approximately CHF 1.35 million. We consider that
neither of these courts has jurisdiction to review these claims and that, in any event, these claims are
without merit and are not supported by any evidence. The proceedings before both courts are ongoing.
A preliminary hearing for the proceeding before the Belgrade Commercial Court was held and
completed on December 7, 2021. The main hearing is scheduled for February 23, 2022. We submitted
a response on September 29, 2021 with respect to the proceeding before the Zurich Commercial Court,
and Telekom Srbija’s response is pending.

**_Elins Panic_**

In February 2018, Elins Panic KEP d.o.o., submitted a claim against Telemach BH, as successor of
BHB Cable TV d.o.o. Lukavac (“BHB”), which was acquired by Telemach BH in 2014. The plaintiff
has asked the court to determine the validity of the acquisition agreement between Telemach and BHB
and to determine whether an asset purchase agreement between the plaintiff as seller and BHB as buyer
of the entire cable infrastructure of a district, which was a major part of the cable infrastructure shown
as the property of BHB, was valid. The proceeding is pending.

**_Litigation Matters Relating to Tele2 Croatia (now trading as Telemach Croatia)_**

In the ordinary course of its business, Tele2 Croatia (which we acquired in March 2020) entered into
factoring agreements with Raiffeisen factoring d.o.o., Zagreb, whereby Tele2 Croatia assigned some of
its accounts receivables relating to one of its main distributors. The assignment was made on a recourse
basis, with Tele2 Croatia bearing the risk towards the distributor that was part of a corporate group
facing solvency problems. In April 2017, Raiffeisen factoring d.o.o., Zagreb, initiated a lawsuit against
Tele2 Croatia for approximately €5.6 million based on such recourse agreements. Tele2 Croatia has
disputed the claims and has filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff in the amount of approximately
€5.6 million. The plaintiff was merged with Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d., Zagreb, and therefore
Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d., Zagreb is its legal successor/ successor in title and the counterparty in court
case. In November 2021, the Commercial Court of Zagreb issued a decision rejecting Tele2 Croatia’s
counterclaim and awarding €2.9 million to Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d., Zagreb. Both parties appealed
this decision and the appeal is currently pending before the High Commercial Court.

**_Copyright infringement claims by EURO-World Network and eMedia Network, Inc._**

On August 2, 2021, SBB Serbia, City Media Plus-Streaming ex Yu Društvo SA Ograničenom
Odgovornošću Beograd (“City Media (Serbia)”), EON TV International and UG Network AG (Swiss)
were notified of a lawsuit brought by EURO-World Network and eMedia Network, Inc., both based in
the United States and part of the eMedia Network Group. The plaintiffs claim damages in the amount
of approximately €108.7 million for alleged exclusive copyright infringement for the re-transmission
by Net TV plus of the HRT programs (i.e., programs of the Croatian public media service) on the
territory of North America, South America, Australia and New Zealand. Since none of SBB Serbia,
City Media (Serbia), EON TV International and UG Network AG operate Net TV plus services, we
believe that the claim is without merit and not supported by evidence. As of the date of this offering


-----

memorandum, the proceeding is pending, and SBB Serbia and City Media (Serbia) have submitted their
respective responses, while EON TV International and UG Network AG (Swiss) have not been formally
served notices of the lawsuit yet.

**_Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD’s Former Shareholders Litigation_**

On July 31, 2020, United Group Bulgaria EOOD (“United Group Bulgaria”) acquired the entire share
capital of Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD (“Viva Telecom”) from InterV Investment S.à r.l (“InterV”
or the “Viva Telecom Former Shareholder”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the sale and
purchase agreement between United Group Bulgaria and InterV, dated November 7, 2019, as amended
from time to time (the “Vivacom Acquisition Agreement,” and the acquisition pursuant to the Vivacom
Acquisition Agreement, hereafter referred to as the “Vivacom Acquisition”).

InterV was purchased by its former shareholders by way of private sale closed in August 2016 from its
creditors following a sale process run by Ernst & Young after an enforcement of security over its shares
by such creditors. Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former
Shareholder have initiated legal proceedings in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg which relate to
the ownership of shares in the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder. Certain other legal proceedings in
relation to Vivacom and its previous share ownership and obligations in Bulgaria have been resolved.
The following is a description of certain ongoing legal proceedings in relation to these matters.

_United Kingdom Litigation_

Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder initiated
legal proceedings in the United Kingdom in 2016, alleging that the auction pursuant to which the Viva
Telecom Former Shareholder’s current shareholders acquired the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder
was a sham and part of a fraudulent conspiracy, and seeking an order that the 2016 sale be unwound
and/or that damages be awarded. In February 2018, the courts in the United Kingdom dismissed all
claims aimed at unwinding the sale and dismissed a claim for damages in respect of the alleged loss of
the indirect interest in the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder by its previous indirect shareholders. New
claims were brought on behalf of the previous direct shareholder of the Viva Telecom Former
Shareholder, which were struck out by the UK courts in July 2019 for lack of authority and on
jurisdictional grounds.

Currently, the only outstanding claim in the United Kingdom is a damages claim between certain
indirect former shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder against (among others) former
shareholders and former creditors of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder for the alleged loss of
opportunity to participate in the 2016 auction and acquire control over the Vivacom Group. The
outstanding English proceedings were stayed in January 2020 (and remain so) pending the outcome of
the Main Luxembourg Proceedings (as defined below). Such damages claim relates to matters as
between certain indirect former shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder and former
shareholders and creditors of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder and therefore does not relate to
Vivacom or us as the claim has no relation to the Vivacom Acquisition.

_Luxembourg Litigation_

- Main Luxembourg Proceedings

After the dismissal in February 2018 and July 2019 of the claims in relation to the unwinding of the
2016 sale in the United Kingdom, the complainants (previous direct and indirect shareholders of the
Viva Telecom Former Shareholder acting through managers of its indirect shareholder) re-instated their
claims in Luxembourg in July 2019 (the “Main Luxembourg Proceedings”). Similar to the proceedings
in the United Kingdom, the complainants are seeking to unwind the 2016 sale of the Viva Telecom
Former Shareholder and/or to receive damages.


-----

While the outcome of the Main Luxembourg Proceedings cannot be determined, we believe that, on the
basis of the information and documents we possess, it is likely a Luxembourg judge will rule in a similar
manner as the UK courts. Even if a Luxembourg judge did agree with the complainants, we believe that
the most likely remedy would be the payment of damages by the former direct and/or indirect owners
of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder (or other persons/entities involved in the 2016 sale) to
previous owners of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder, rather than any remedy involving Vivacom
or us.

Further, an outcome favorable to the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder’s previous direct and indirect
shareholders is unlikely to have an adverse impact on us or the Vivacom Group. Other than in respect
of the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, neither we nor United Group Bulgaria have a direct or indirect
relationship with the former direct or indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former Shareholder.
Moreover, United Group Bulgaria acquired Viva Telecom’s shares (and not the Viva Telecom Former
Shareholder shares) in an arm’s length transaction for fair market value pursuant to a public auction
process organized by a reputable financial advisor.

The Main Luxembourg Proceedings are ongoing and are expected to continue for at least the next two
to three years. Although we have been summoned to join the Main Luxembourg Proceedings (as
described below), the Main Luxembourg Proceedings and the Intervention Proceedings (as defined
below) are currently managed separately by the Luxembourg court, so we are currently not requested
to actively participate in the Main Luxembourg Proceedings.

- Intervention Proceedings

Following the signing of the Vivacom Acquisition Agreement, we were summoned to be joined to the
Main Luxembourg Proceedings (the “Intervention Proceedings”) for purposes of putting us on notice
of the Main Luxembourg Proceedings. No claims have been made against us in the Intervention
Proceedings and the Intervention Proceedings are still ongoing. The complainants in the Main
Luxembourg Proceedings have in the meantime withdrawn their intervention claim. However, as we
have raised doubts as to the formal procedural validity of this withdrawal, the parties are currently in
the process of filing briefs on the withdrawal (among other issues).

- Second Luxembourg Proceedings

In March and April 2020, previous direct and indirect shareholders of the Viva Telecom Former
Shareholder initiated new proceedings in Luxembourg (the “Second Luxembourg Proceedings”).
Similar to the Main Luxembourg Proceedings, the claimants argue that the 2016 sale of the Viva
Telecom Former Shareholder should be unwound, and as a consequence, any subsequent event resulting
from that sale, including the Vivacom Acquisition, should also be unwound.

The parties are currently exchanging written submissions, and given the large number of defendants,
the proceedings in Luxembourg are expected to continue for at least the next two to three years.

**_Acquisitions of local broadband and television operators in Bulgaria_**

In 2021, Vivacom acquired local broadband and television operators Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia EAD,
Digital Cable Television EOOD and agreed to acquire Networx-Bulgaria EOOD. As of the date of this
offering memorandum, the latter acquisition has not been completed. These transactions were approved
by the CPC, which provided the required merger clearance authorizations. However, Telenor Bulgaria
EAD challenged the CPC’s decisions for approval relating to these transactions before the respective
administrative court. Vivacom has intervened in support of the CPC’s decisions. We believe that the
CPC’s decisions were well-reasoned and consistent with Bulgarian competition law. Nevertheless, in
September and October 2021, the administrative court issued judgments by which it annulled CPC’s
approvals regarding Net 1 EOOD, ComNet Sofia EAD and Digital Cable Television EOOD, essentially
for reasons relating to the formal procedure before the CPC. The CPC and Vivacom filed appeals against


-----

these judgments in front of the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court. These judgments did not have
any impact on the acquisitions as the appeals suspended the application of the judgments, and Vivacom
has already integrated the acquired companies. If the first instance judgments and annulments are upheld
by the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court, the CPC will have to re-examine the transactions.
Telenor Bulgaria’s challenge against the CPC’s approval relating to the acquisition of NetworxBulgaria EOOD is currently pending in front of the administrative court.

**_Bulgarian tax audits_**

Both Viva Telecom and Vivacom are subject to several tax audits. These tax audits and related
proceedings are being carried out in a variety of venues and are being challenged as appropriate. The
companies have already paid the amounts ascertained by the tax audits, and in the case respective
challenges are successful, an amount of up to BGN 21.5 million and associated interest could be
recovered.

**Regulatory Framework**

**_European Union_**

The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications was revised in 2018 with the adoption of
the Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 11, 2018 on
the European Electronic Communications Code (“EECC”). The EECC has come into full effect across
EU Member States following the expiration of the deadline for its implementation at the national level
in December 2020. The EECC codifies in one single document all the applicable laws and regulations
forming the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications. The main objectives of the EECC
are to contribute to the development of the internal market by harmonizing provisions of the
telecommunications regulatory framework, specifically in the area of spectrum and consumer rights, to
remove legal uncertainty over the application of this regulatory framework to certain over-the-top
(OTT) services, and to promote the deployment and take-up of very high-capacity networks, such as
fiber and 5G networks.

_Becoming an Operator_

The general authorization regime lays down rights and obligations for operating electronic
communication networks and/or providing electronic communication services and implies that
telecommunications providers need not wait for a decision of the competent national regulatory
authority (“NRA”) in order to start their activity. Operators abiding by the general authorization
conditions can start to operate electronic communications networks or provide electronic
communication services upon notifying the NRA of their intention to commence service. Such
notification is the maximum requirement that national authorities can impose on telecommunications
providers. However, EU Member States can also opt to implement a no-notification regime.

_Radio Spectrum_

Radio spectrum rules governing authorizations, rights of use and assignment of rights set out in the
EECC aim to facilitate the deployment of high-quality and high-speed wireless broadband coverage,
the development of new wireless technologies and the pursuit of consistency and predictability in
licensing procedures.

EU Member States can determine the most appropriate regime for authorizing the use of radio spectrum,
taking into account (i) the specific characteristics of the radio spectrum concerned; (ii) the need to
protect against harmful interference; (iii) the development of reliable conditions for radio spectrum
sharing, where appropriate; (iv) the need to ensure technical quality of communications or service; (v)
objectives of general interest as laid down by Member States in accordance with EU law; and (vi) the
need to safeguard efficient use of radio spectrum.


-----

EU Member States can authorize the use of radio spectrum for a limited period and are obliged to ensure
that the rights of radio spectrum holder for wireless broadband services are valid for a term of at least
15 years and include an adequate extension ensuring regulatory predictability over at least 20 years.
The general criteria for the renewal of individual rights should be set out in a transparent manner and
the relevant decisions on the renewal of harmonized radio spectrum licences should be taken in a timely
manner before the duration of those rights expires.

Decision-making of the NRAs on granting, amending and renewal of rights of use for radio spectrum
are intended to promote effective competition and prevent distortions of competition. The EECC,
however, left EU Member States the discretion to take appropriate measures with regard to, among
other things, the limitation of the amount of radio spectrum bands, wholesale access and roaming
conditions, spectrum reservation and grounds for refusal in the event of transfer or accumulation of
rights of use.

_Significant Market Power_

While the general aim of the EECC is for the electronic communication sector to be governed by
competition law, the EU regulatory framework sets out rules on SMP and market analysis aimed at
preventing operators with SMP (“SMP operator”) to potentially abuse their market power.

An undertaking is deemed to have SMP if, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position
equivalent to dominance, namely a position of economic strength affording it the power to behave to
an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and ultimately consumers.

Where an NRA establishes that an operator is an SMP operator, it may impose measures or regulatory
obligations (ex-ante regulation) on the SMP operator, in order to address any market failures. The
obligations that may be imposed on the SMP operator are determined in the EECC and include (i)
obligations to ensure transparency and non-discrimination; (ii) accounting separation; (iii) access to
civil engineering; (iv) obligations of access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated
facilities; (v) price control and cost accounting obligations; and (vi) in exceptional cases, functional
separation requiring a vertically integrated SMP operator to place activities related to the wholesale
provision of the relevant access products in an independent business entity.

SMP operators may also offer commitments to open the deployment of a new, very high-capacity
network consisting of optical fiber elements up to the end-user premises or base station to co-investment
(which can be made binding by the NRA). In addition, they are required to inform the NRA in advance
of any intended transfer of their local access network assets (or a substantial part thereof) to a separate
legal entity under different ownership, or the establishment of a separate business entity in order to
provide retail providers, including their own retail divisions, with fully equivalent access products. The
scope for imposing SMP obligations is also limited in respect of companies operating exclusively in
wholesale markets.

The relevant markets in which ex ante regulation may be justified are determined by the NRA, also
taking into account the European Commission’s Recommendation on the Relevant Product and Service
Market (the “EC Recommendation”), the SMP guidelines and national circumstances, if the following
three criteria set out in the EECC are met:

(i) high and non-transitory structural, legal or regulatory barriers to entry are present;

(ii) there is a market structure which does not tend towards effective competition within the

relevant time horizon, having regard to the state of infrastructure-based competition and other

sources of competition behind the barriers to entry; and

(iii) competition law alone is insufficient to adequately address the identified market failure(s).


-----

A revised version of the EC Recommendation was issued by the European Commission in December
2020 (“New EC Recommendation”) and includes the following markets susceptible to _ex-ante_
regulation in accordance with the EECC:

Market 1: Wholesale local access provided at a fixed location

Market 2: Wholesale dedicated capacity

_Symmetric Access Obligations_

The NRAs may impose so called “symmetric” access obligations to all providers of electronic
communication networks and operators of such networks and apply to network elements that cannot be
duplicated. Symmetric access obligations can be imposed to grant access to:

(i) wiring, cables and associated facilities inside buildings or up to the first concentration or

distribution point as determined by the NRA where such point is located outside the building,

or

(ii) beyond the first concentration or distribution point, to a point that the NRA determines to be

the closest to end-users, capable of hosting a sufficient number of end-user connections to be

commercially viable for efficient access seekers.

_Numbering Resources_

EU Member States control the granting of rights of use for national numbering resources and the
management of the national numbering plans. They can assign numbers to undertakings other than
providers of electronic communications networks or services, enable an extraterritorial use of nongeographic numbers within the EU for the provision of non-interpersonal communications services and
ensure the efficient use of numbering resources.

Upon request, the NRAs may grant individual rights of use for numbering resources (e.g., telephone
numbers) to any undertaking for the operation of electronic communications networks or the provision
of services covered by a general authorization. NRAs or other competent authorities shall take decisions
on the granting of rights of use for numbering resources as soon as possible after receipt of the complete
application and within three weeks in the case of numbering resources that have been allocated for
specific purposes within the national numbering plan. When doing so, the NRAs specify whether those
rights can be transferred, and under which conditions.

Member States may allow NRAs to impose fees for the rights of use for numbering resources which
reflect the need to ensure the optimal use of those resources.

**_Bulgaria_**

Telecommunications operations in Bulgaria are governed by the Electronic Communications Act
(Zakon za electronnite saobstenia or “ZES”), which came into force on May 22, 2007 and was amended
on March 9, 2021 in order to transpose the EECC into Bulgarian legislation.

_Becoming an Operator_

A legal entity seeking to become an operator is required to notify Bulgarian Regulatory Authority
(“CRC”) about its intent to operate public communication networks or to provide public communication
services prior to the beginning of the performance of its activities. The notification must include the
required general information about the legal entity (such as the name and address of establishment etc.),
а brief description of the networks and services which will be provided, data on territorial coverage, a
contact person and the relevant details, an estimated date of the beginning of the activity and the address


-----

of the operator’s website related to the provision of public communication networks services. Within
14 days from receipt of the complete notification, CRC shall register the operator in its official register.

An operator must notify CRC about (i) changes to the information included in the original notification
(listed above) within 14 days from the relevant change; and (ii) the termination of activity within 14
days from its occurrence.

An operator is obliged to pay an annual fee to CRC, which is calculated by CRC on the basis of the
annual turnover generated by an operator from the provision of public communication networks or
public communication services in Bulgaria, and must be reported to CRC by March 15 of each year.
Generally, the annual fee is equal to 0.20% of the relevant operator’s gross yearly revenues that exceed
BGN 0.1 million. In addition to these fees, operators of electronic communication that use scarce
resources (spectrum and/or numbers) are obliged to pay the corresponding annual fees.

_Radio-Frequency Spectrum_

CRC issues decisions on the award of radio frequencies for the provision of public communication
services to end-users after holding a contest or auction, in case the number of applicants is greater than
the number of operators which may obtain an authorization of the respective free limited resource. CRC
issues the decision on the award of radio frequencies for an initial period of not less than 15 years,
which can be extended to 20 years to ensure predictability with regard to infrastructure investment
conditions, based on the use of such frequencies. The holder of a decision on the award of radio
frequencies may transfer the permission or part of its rights and respective obligations to a third-party
with CRC’s prior consent.

_Numbering Plan_

CRC adopts the numbering plan with a general act that determines the type, length, and structure of the
numbering elements, their intended use, and manner of use, including numbers for emergency calls and
numbers the use of which is harmonized based on EU regulations. This general act must also support
number portability and the introduction of new electronic communication services.

_Operators with Significant Market Power_

The definition of a SMP operator under ZES closely follows the relevant definition in the EECC. The
relevant markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation are determined by CRC taking into account principles
of competition law and the valid EC Recommendation, as applicable from time to time. While the New
EC Recommendation has delisted certain markets that were previously susceptible to _ex-ante_
regulation, CRC continues to impose ex-ante regulation measures on the following markets (determined
in the previously valid EC Recommendation):


Market M1/2014 FTR


Wholesale call termination on individual public
telephone networks provided at a fixed location


Market M2/2014 MTR Wholesale voice call termination on individual
mobile networks

In addition to the above, there are also various further legal and/or regulatory requirements, depending
on the relevant business activity of the operator.

_Electronic Media Act_

The Radio and Television Act (Zakon za radioto I televiziata or “ZRT”) came into force on July 5,
1999 and was last amended to implement Directive (EU) 2018/1808 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of November 14, 2018 (amending Directive 2010/13/EU on the coordination of certain
provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative acts in Member States concerning the


-----

provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) in the light of changing
market conditions).

Neither the ZRT nor the ZES prohibits a telecommunications operator from carrying out activities of a
TV or radio broadcaster and vice versa. The Bulgarian Media Regulator (SEM) authorizes any radio
and TV operator and providers of media services under the ZRT. This authorization entitles for
broadcasting of programs by an operator which has been granted a permission by CRC for use of radiofrequency spectrum through electronic communication networks for terrestrial or satellite radio
broadcasting.

**_Croatia_**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, Croatia has not yet implemented the EECC into its national
legislation and therefore the currently applicable laws and regulations described below are based on the
existing Electronic Communication Act (Zakon o elektroničkim komunikacijama or “ZEK”), which
came into force on July 1, 2008 (as subsequently amended) and are subject to change. While there is no
specific timeline with respect to the adoption of the new Electronic Communication Act implementing
the EECC into Croatian legislation, it is expected for the first quarter of 2022.

_Becoming an Operator_

A legal entity seeking to become an operator is required to notify the Croatian Regulatory Authority for
Network Industries (“HAKOM”) about its intent to operate public communication networks or to
provide public communication services at least 15 days prior to the beginning of the performance of its
activities. The form and method of notification are defined by the Ordinance on the manner and
conditions for the provision of electronic communications networks and services issued by HAKOM
on December 15, 2011 (as subsequently amended). Within eight days from receipt of the complete
notification, HAKOM registers the operator in its official register and submits a confirmation notice to
the operator (such confirmation is not an administrative decision and does not itself create rights and
obligations under the ZEK).

An operator is obliged to pay an annual fee to HAKOM, which is calculated by HAKOM on the basis
of the annual turnover generated by an operator from the provision of public communication networks
or public communication services in Croatia, and must be reported to HAKOM by March 31 of each
year. Generally, the annual fee is equal to 0.20% of the relevant operator’s gross yearly revenues that
exceed HRK 7.5 million. In addition to these fees, all operators of electronic communication are obliged
to pay certain other fees and charges, including parafiscal charges defined by the relevant applicable
laws.

_Radio-Frequency Spectrum_

Radio frequencies for the provision of public communication services to end-users in Croatia are
awarded by HAKOM by way of a decision issued on the basis of an undertaken process (public call,
public contest or auction). A decision on the award of radio frequencies is issued for a limited time
period, taking into account appropriate time for amortization of investment, but for no longer than for
20 years. The holder of a decision on award of radio frequency must pay an annual usage fee to HAKOM
as well to the state budget.

_Numbering Plan_

HAKOM adopts the numbering plan with a general act that determines the type, length, and structure
of the numbering elements, their intended use, and manner of use, including numbers for emergency
calls and numbers the use of which is harmonized based on EU regulations. This general act must also
support number portability and the introduction of new electronic communication services.


-----

_Operators with Significant Market Power_

The definition of a SMP operator under ZEK closely follows the relevant definition in the EECC. The
relevant markets susceptible to _ex-ante regulation are determined by HAKOM taking into account_
principles of competition law and the valid EC Recommendation, as applicable from time to time. While
the New EC Recommendation has delisted certain markets that were previously susceptible to ex-ante
regulation, HAKOM continues to impose _ex-ante regulation measures on the following markets_
(determined in the previously valid EC Recommendation):

Market M1/2007 Fixed Telephony Access to the public telephone network at a fixed
location for residential and non-residential
customers

Market M1/2014 FTR Wholesale call termination on individual public
telephone networks provided at a fixed location

Market M2/2014 MTR Wholesale voice call termination on individual
mobile networks

Market M3a/2014 ULL Wholesale local access provided at a fixed
location

Market M3b/2014 Bitstream Access Wholesale central access provided at a fixed
location for mass-market products

Market M4/2014 Wholesale high quality access provided at a fixed
location

Market M14/2003 Wholesale trunk segments of high quality access
services

Market M2/2007 Call origination on the public telephone network
provided at a fixed location

In addition to the above, there are also various further legal and/or regulatory requirements, depending
on the relevant business activity of the operator.

_Electronic Media Act_

In October 2021, the Croatian Parliament adopted the new Electronic Media Act (Zakon o electroničkim
_medijima or “new ZEM”), which came into force on October 22, 2021._

The new ZEM no longer contains the provision on vertical integration as stipulated in the previous
version of the Electronic Media Act, which prohibited a telecommunications operator carrying out
activities of audiovisual and/or radio program transmission to serve as a TV and/or radio broadcaster
and/or a media service provider at the same time. In practice, this meant that entities engaging in
telecommunication operations were not allowed to engage in the transmission of audiovisual and/or
radio programs if they are under common control with a TV and/or radio broadcaster.

With the removal of the provision on vertical integration in the new ZEM, telecommunication operators
carrying out activities of audiovisual and/or radio program transmission in Croatia are now allowed to
also serve as TV and/or radio broadcasters and/or media service providers.

**_Slovenia_**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, Slovenia has not yet implemented the EECC into its
national legislation and therefore the currently applicable laws and regulations described below are
based on the existing Electronic Communication Act (ZEKom-1) and are subject to change. As of the
date of this offering memorandum, no specific timeline is available with respect to the adoption of the
new Slovenian Electronic Communication Act (ZEKom-2) implementing the EECC into Slovenian
legislation.


-----

_Becoming an Operator_

Entities who seek to operate public electronic communication networks (“PECN”) or provide public
electronic communication services (“PECS”) must notify the Agency for Communication Networks
and Services of the Republic of Slovenia (“AKOS”) using a form prescribed by AKOS. Upon the receipt
of a complete notification, AKOS subsequently registers the operator in its official register and sends a
confirmation notice to the operator (such confirmation is not an administrative decision and does not
itself create rights and obligations under the ZEKom-1).

An operator is obliged to notify AKOS in case of (i) any change in the company name or other legal
information contained in the initial notification, within 30 days of such change; (ii) any change in the
starting date of the operation of PECN or the provision of PECS or changes to the geographic area in
which PECN is operated or PECS are provided, prior to their occurrence; and (iii) the planned cessation
of provision of PECN and/or PECS, at least 90 days prior to the planned cessation.

An operator is obliged to pay an annual fee to AKOS, which is calculated by AKOS on the basis of the
annual turnover generated by an operator from the provision of PECS and/or PECN in Slovenia, and
must be reported to AKOS by March 31 of each year.

_Radio Spectrum_

Radio frequencies for the provision of public communication services to end-users in Slovenia are
awarded by AKOS by way of a decision issued on the basis of a public tender. A decision on the award
of radio frequencies is issued for a limited time period, taking into account appropriate time for
amortization of investment, but for no longer than for 15 years. The validity of a decision on the award
of radio frequencies for the provision of public communication services to end-users cannot be
extended. No special rules determining longer duration period or the possibility of extension are
determined in respect of radio spectrum holder rights for wireless broadband services. The holder of the
decision on award of radio frequencies may transfer its right to use such radio frequency to a third-party
with a prior consent of AKOS. However, operators may not accumulate radio frequencies with the
objective of limiting competition on the radio communication market.

AKOS may ex officio change the decision on award of radio frequency in order to ensure effective use
of radio frequency spectrum for the public good or for certain other causes as prescribed by law. In
addition, AKOS may, among other things, annul the decision to award a radio frequency if the award
was granted on the basis of untrue data, if the holder no longer complies with the requirements laid
down in the relevant legislation or the decision itself, or does not begin to use the radio frequency within
the prescribed time period, transfers the right to a third-party, or if the fees for the use of radio frequency
or for the effective use of a finite commodity have not been paid.

The holder of a decision on award of radio frequency must pay an annual usage fee to AKOS. The
amount of the annual fee is based on the coverage and density of population or the radio frequency,
radio frequency band width, the type of radio communications involved, or a combination of the above,
but may not restrict or hinder competition or market entry. To ensure optimal use of radio frequencies,
holders of decisions on award of radio frequencies for the provision of public communication services
must also pay a fee for the effective use of a finite commodity. The minimal amount of such payment
and terms of payment shall be determined in the decision on the initiation of the public tender procedure,
and may not unduly hinder the provision of innovative services and competition.

_Significant Market Power_

The definition of a SMP operator under ZEKom-1 closely follows the relevant definition in the EECC.
ZEKom-1, however, sets out a list of specific criteria it considers when assessing whether an operator
has SMP, including, _inter alia, the market share of the operator and its variations over time; the_


-----

existence of barriers to entry and their effect on the potential competition; the impact of large users on
the power of the operator; the stage of development of the relevant market; and the level of integration.

The scope of measures or regulatory obligations that may be imposed on a SMP operator as part of the
_ex-ante regulation are generally in line with the measures and obligations set out in the EECC, save for_
obligations on the access of civil engineering which are not envisaged in ZEKom-1. ZEKom-1 does not
include any rules allowing SMP operators to offer any commitments to open the deployment of a new
very high capacity network and does not include any exemption in respect of companies operating
exclusively in wholesale markets.

The relevant markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation are determined by AKOS taking into account
principles of competition law and taking into account the EC Recommendation, as applicable from time
to time. While the New EC Recommendation has delisted certain markets that were previously
susceptible to _ex-ante regulation, AKOS continues to impose_ _ex-ante regulation measures on the_
following markets (determined in the EC Recommendation):

Market 1: Wholesale call termination on individual public telephone networks provided at
a fixed location;

Market 2: Wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;

Market 3a: Wholesale local access provided at a fixed location;

Market 3b: Wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for mass market products;
and

Market 4: Wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location.

While it has not yet been publicly disclosed, it has been unofficially indicated that AKOS will continue
to impose ex-ante regulation measures on all above listed markets.

_Symmetric Access Obligations_

AKOS may provide suitable operator access by way of a decision, if it assesses this to be appropriate
under the circumstances. In this respect, AKOS may impose obligations in particular on operators that
control access to end-users to the extent necessary to ensure the connection of both ends, including the
obligation to interconnect networks or, in justified cases and to the necessary extent, impose the
obligation to enable interoperability of operators’ services.

_Numbering Resources_

Numbering resources in Slovenia are managed by AKOS, which adopts the numbering plan by way of
general act determining the type, length, and structure of the numbering elements, their intended use,
and manner of use, including numbers for emergency calls, and numbers the use of which is harmonized
based on EU regulations. This general act must also support number portability and the introduction of
new electronic communication services. Numbering resources may be used by, and can be allocated to,
operators only on the basis of the AKOS’ decision on the allocation of numbering resources.

While the EECC envisages that the NRA may, under certain circumstances, also grant the right to use
for numbering resources to undertakings other than operators, ZEKom-1 limits this solely to (natural or
legal) persons who can prove that they need numbering resources for the provision of activity in the
public interest. This decision on allocation of numbering resources is issued on the basis of a specific
application pursuant to ZEKom-1. Save for when a public tender is carried out, AKOS is obliged to
issue its decision within the time limits complaint with the EECC. Such decision also sets the conditions
for the use of the allocated numbering resources.

A special numbering resources fee is payable to AKOS for the use of allocated numbering resources.

**_Greece_**


-----

The Greek electronic communication sector is mainly governed by L. 4727/2020 (the “2020 Law”)
which transposed the EECC into Greek national legal framework. The 2020 Law also regulates certain
matters (relevant to radio spectrum and satellite orbit and related frequencies rights) that have not been
transposed directly from the EECC. Certain of the main differences between the 2020 Law and the
EECC are summarized herein.

_ΕΕΤΤ_

The Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission (“ΕΕΤΤ”) is the Greek national regulatory
authority for telecommunication and postal markets and is responsible for majority of the tasks entrusted
to the NRAs under the EECC (as transposed into Greek national legislation).

_General Licensing_

Greek national rules are generally harmonized with the provisions of the EECC relating to the general
licensing procedure. However, the general licensing procedure does not extend to:

(i) resale of telecommunications services to users;

(ii) own use of radio equipment terminal on the basis of non-exclusive use of special radio

frequency by the user for reasons not related to economic activity, which does not constitute a

network supply or electronic communications service and is governed by the provisions of the

current legislation concerning terminal equipment and radio equipment; or

(iii) state-owned telecommunication networks.

The interested (natural or legal) persons are required to complete and submit a Registration Declaration
for Engaging in Electronic Communication Activities to EETT under a General Authorization Regime
(notification), including the minimum information necessary to enable BEREC and the ΕΕΤΤ to keep
a Register of electronic communications networks and services providers.

Operators are under an obligation to submit a supplementary or amended Registration Declaration (i)
in order to engage in the provision of additional electronic communication services or/and networks;
(ii) if they terminate the provision of some or all the electronic communication services or/and networks;
and (iii) if any change is made in the details stated in the initial Registration Declaration. Any change
of data shall be notified within fifteen (15) days from its occurrence.

The EETT may impose fees for general licensing to operators on the basis of the turnover of the
provider, a flat-rate charging system, or a combination of the two. Providers of networks electronic
communication networks and/or services are also obliged to pay the EETT annual administrative
charges, which are calculated based on the total gross income in charges zones.

EETT monitors and supervises the providers’ compliance with the existing legislation. In addition,
EETT may request providers that are subject to the General Authorization Regime or enjoy rights of
use of radio spectrum or resources numbering resources, to provide all information necessary to verify
their compliance with the above.

_Radio Spectrum_

EETT and the Greek Ministry of Digital Governance are responsible for ensuring the effective
management of the radio spectrum. In this respect, in 2019 the Greek Ministry of Defence and the
Ministry of Digital Governance adopted the National Band and Frequency Allocation Regulation by a
joint ministerial decision, which provides, inter alia, for (i) national distribution plans for radio in
services; (ii) references to restrictions related to radio-spectrum management; and (iii) reports on the
possibility of using radio equipment in specific radio frequency bands, as well as for radio frequency


-----

bands that can be used by electronic equipment for industrial mechanical, scientific, medical (Industrial,
Scientific, Medical “ISM”) or other applications.

EETT is the competent authority to grant rights of use of radio frequencies. There are certain radio
spectrum bands that do not require the granting of an individual right of use. For all other spectrum
rights, the granting procedure depends on whether or not there is a number limitation on those rights.

For the granting of radio spectrum rights of use without limitations to their number, interested
parties should submit a request to the EETT. Following the examination of the application, which takes
place in order of priority, the EETT grants the applicant the individual right to use certain radio spectrum
bands. In the case of radio spectrum rights of use with limitations to their number, the imposition of
such limit takes place by virtue of an EETT decision. If necessary to ensure the effective use of the
radio spectrum and accommodate the current supply-demand conditions in the market, the EETT
(following a relevant decision by the Minister of Digital Governance) issues a proclamation for a tender
procedure, specifying in detail the procedure and conditions of the invitation to tender. The right of use
is awarded for a specific period of time.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, an amendment of the regulation on the radio spectrum
rights of use is expected.

The 2020 Law provides for a possible exception to the obligation to follow the procedure for granting
of individual rights to use radio spectrum where the granting of individual rights of use of radio
spectrum to providers of radio or television broadcasting content services is necessary to achieve a
public interest objective.

Transfer or timeshare of individual rights to use radio spectrum

Subject to certain specific conditions, providers operating in the Greek territory may transfer or timelease individual rights of use of radio spectrum to other undertakings subject to authorization by EETT.

Procedure for limiting the number of spectrum rights to be granted

Where it is considered that the use of radio spectrum cannot be subject to a general authorization, and
upon considering whether to limit the number of rights to use radio spectrum to be granted, due regard
shall be given, inter alia, to the need to maximise the benefits for users and to facilitate the development
of competition. Accordingly, following a public consultation phase aimed at examining the need to limit
the number of rights of use for radio spectrum, the Greek Minister of Digital Governance may, in its
decision, limit the number of spectrum usage rights to be granted. This decision shall specify the type
of competitive procedure to be followed for their allocation. The Greek Minister of Digital Governance
may review the limitation of the number of spectrum usage rights to be granted, increasing or decreasing
the relevant number.

Radio spectrum supervision

EETT plans, develops and operates a network of fixed and mobile stations spectrum compliance. Any
infringement of the related provisions may be subject to administrative and/or criminal sanctions.

Satellite orbit management

The geostatic or non-orbital positions of satellites and their associated frequencies awarded or assigned
to the country constitute rare resources and public goods with significant social, cultural and economic
value, the management of which constitutes a sovereign right of the Greek State. The assignment of
such rights may only take place through an objective, transparent and impartial tender procedure with
proportionality criteria.


-----

_Significant Market Power_

The definition of a SMP operator under the 2020 Law closely follows the relevant definition in the
EECC. The relevant markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation are determined by EETT in adherence
with the guidelines on market analysis and the assessment of significant market power published by the
European Commission.

While the New EC Recommendation has delisted certain markets that were previously susceptible to
_ex-ante regulation, EETT continues to impose ex-ante regulation measures on the following markets_
(determined in the previously valid EC Recommendations):

Market 1: Wholesale call termination on individual public telephone networks provided at
a fixed location;

Market 2: Wholesale voice call termination on individual mobile networks;

Market 3a: Wholesale local access provided at a fixed location;

Market 3b: Wholesale central access provided at a fixed location for mass market products;

Market 4: Wholesale high-quality access provided at a fixed location; and

Market 14: Leased Line Trunk Segments market.

The EETT has not yet determined whether they shall continue to impose ex ante regulation measures
on the markets listed above.

_Numbering Resources_

The National Numbering Plan (NNP) is issued by the Greek Minister of Digital Governance, and
ensures the provision of adequate numbering resources in all electronic communication services
provided to the public.

The EETT manages the NNP, issues a regulation determining the procedure, the prerequisites and the
details related to the granting of rights of use and the efficient use of all national numbering resources,
assigns, binds, revokes and restricts the rights of use of numbers or sum of numbers, monitors its
implementation and defines the fees for the assignment and use of numbering resources.

The procedure for the granting of right of use of numbering resources shall be objective, transparent,
non-discriminatory, proportionate and open to every operator. EETT is responsible for the assignment
of numbering resources. Numbering resources allocation applications shall be submitted only
electronically on EETT’s digital platform. They are examined in order of priority and shall be completed
within 21 days. The relevant EETT decision is notified to the applicant.

Fees for rights of use for numbering resources

EETT imposes fees for the rights of use for numbering resources which reflect the need to ensure the
optimal use of those resources. The fees are objectively justified, transparent, non-discriminatory and
proportionate in relation to their intended purpose and shall take into account the objectives closely
following the general objectives of the EECC and the objective of ensuring the efficient use of radio
spectrum and satellite orbits.

_Rights of Way_

Telecommunications providers can, upon filing an application, receive the right of installation on
private, public or municipal properties. The authorities granting such rights should do so in a
transparent, impartial and accessible to the public manner. The holder of the right is obliged to pay a
relevant fee that is calculated according to a relevant regulation issued by EETT. No other fee is owed
by the provider.


-----

_Co-locations_

The EETT holds the power to enforce the co-location and sharing of the network infrastructure upon a
telecommunications provider that has already secured the right to use a land. The decision should aim
at the protection of the environment, public health, public security or civil planning goals.

**_Serbia_**

_General_

Under the Serbian Electronic Communication Act (“ECA”), the main piece of legislation regulating the
performance of electronic communication activities and the operation of the networks thereof in Serbia,
a company’s general authorization to conduct its business is in most cases sufficient to provide
electronic communication services. A sector-specific license is required only if the business involves
the exploitation of scarce resources, such as phone numbers or radio frequencies. Therefore, when a
company takes up an activity under the general authorization regime, all it needs to do (subject to
fulfillment of the imposed general conditions (technical and certain others) and payment of the
prescribed fees) is to notify RATEL within 15-days of doing so. In addition, the company is required
to act in compliance with general conditions during its operations and to notify RATEL of any important
changes in its activities, as well as of their termination.

_Significant Market Power Under the ECA_

Under the ECA, an operator is considered to have SMP, if it has, alone or together with other operators,
a dominant position, i.e., a position that enables it to a significant degree to act independently from its
competitors, subscribers and customers. Pursuant to the ECA, if RATEL finds the absence of effective
competition in a relevant market (and a closely related market), it will designate the operator who,
individually or jointly with other operators, has SMP on that market, by taking into account different
market conditions.

If RATEL reaches a decision designating one or more operators as having SMP, RATEL may impose
at least one of the following obligations on the respective entities:

- an obligation to publish data from accounting records, technical specifications, network

characteristics, terms and conditions for supply and use or validity periods of the offer and

prices;

- an obligation to only engage in non-discriminatory conduct;

- an obligation to keep separate accounts for interconnection and access services;

- an obligation to provide access and use of parts of its network infrastructure and associated

facilities to third parties;

- price controls and cost-based accounting;

- an obligation to make available a minimum set of leased lines;

- an obligation to offer operator selection and operator pre-selection services; and


-----

- regulation of the respective operators’ retail services, including an obligation to unbundle

products and services.

_Tariffs_

As a general matter, each operator is free to set its own tariffs. However, if RATEL finds an operator
to have SMP in a relevant market, the operator may become subject to various restrictions, including
price controls, as noted above. If an operator becomes subject to price controls, it must adopt a cost
based accounting system for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access services.
These controls are imposed if, in particular, RATEL determines that the absence of effective
competition enables the operator to charge exceedingly high prices or resort to price squeezes to the
detriment of end-users.

While RATEL has some flexibility in imposing these restrictions, it must take into consideration the
previous investments made by the operator while imposing the aforesaid measures, it must encourage
further investments and it must allow for a reasonable rate of return on investment in view of the risks
involved.

The burden of proof that an operator’s prices comply with the above-mentioned restrictions is on the
relevant operator. Upon RATEL’s request, the operator in question is required to provide a detailed
account of its pricing policy.

A description of the operator’s price calculations must be made publicly available and reviewed
annually by an independent auditor.

_Law on Electronic Media_

Provision of audiovisual media services via electronic communication networks is subject to a license
by the media regulator REM. Such license is valid for a period of eight calendar years and may be
extended. In order to extend the term of the license, the licensee must submit a request for the extension
of the license at least six months before its expiration. The holder of the license must notify REM of
any change in its direct or indirect ownership structure for REM’s verification as to whether the change
of control may lead to violation of the rules on media concentration (concentration of ownership or
management rights in two or more electronic media publishers, or acquisition of more than 50% of
share of daily news publishers with circulation of more than 50,000 copies annually, and audio and
AVM service providers). Failure to abide by media concentration rules may lead to license revocation.

**_Bosnia and Herzegovina_**

_Telecommunications Services_

The Bosnian Law on Communications regulates telecommunications, radio, broadcasting (including
cable television) and associated services and facilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as the
establishment and the activities of the Bosnian Communications Regulatory Agency (“CRA”).

The CRA was established on March 2, 2001 and assumed the competences of the Independent Media
Commission and the Telecommunications Regulatory Agency. The CRA is responsible for developing
rules in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors, the licensing of operators in these sectors, the
planning, management and allocation of the frequency spectrum, the implementation of technical and
quality standards and the determination and maintenance of license fees.

Telecommunications services through fixed-line and mobile networks or internet services may only be
offered if the relevant operator holds a license. A telecommunications operator is required to:


-----

- enter into written subscription contracts with its subscribers;

- provide (free of charge) a brief and plain summary of the tariffs applicable to its subscribers;

- deliver, at the request of the CRA, within a reasonable period of time, business data, network

data and traffic data including confidential data;

- ensure the proper functioning and good working condition of its system and the timely removal

of interferences and failures and notify the CRA without any undue delay of any significant

interruption in the telecommunications connections;

- set up conditions of operation, a description of services and specify the relevant tariffs, all of

which must be presented to the CRA and published in a suitable form; the operator must also

publish any changes to the conditions of operations and tariffs at least one month prior to their

effective date in a suitable form; any change to the content of a contract entitles the contracting

party to terminate its contract with the telecommunications operator within a period of four

weeks from the publication of the change; and

- offer interconnection services to other operators upon their request; if the relevant parties cannot

reach an agreement within a period of six weeks from receipt of the request, each of them may

petition the CRA to mediate the dispute.

The CRA decides upon the grant of a telecommunications license within two months of receiving an
appropriate application. In the event of competitive or comparative selection procedures the CRA may
extend the evaluation period for up to four months to ensure that such procedures are fair, reasonable,
open, non- discriminatory and transparent to all interested parties. The CRA will grant a license if the
applicant possesses the necessary technical competence and if there is no reason to assume that the
applicant will not provide the relevant services in accordance with the license, in particular as regards
quality and supply. In reaching its decision, the CRA takes into consideration the applicant’s financial
strength, its experience in the telecommunications sector and related sectors as well as its relevant
expertise. A licensee may transfer its license in whole or in part only with the consent of the CRA,
which defines the conditions for the transfer of the license.

_Operators with Significant Market Power_

A telecommunications operator with significant market power must allow third parties to access its
public telecommunications network or unbundled parts of such network. The obligation related to
interconnection does not apply if the CRA determines, based on evidence provided by the
telecommunications operator, that it would be inappropriate to require the operator to open its network.
A telecommunications operator with significant market power requires the CRA’s approval to provide
(i) voice telephony services via a fixed-line or mobile network and (ii) leased lines. In addition, a
telecommunications operator with significant market power in the telecommunications market is
required to provide to its competitors open and non-discriminatory access to its services, establish a
cost accounting system that assigns costs to all of its services and permits subsequent audits of this
system in compliance with the CRA rules and the provisions set out in the licenses, and provide a
minimum set of lines for lease to third parties. Such an operator is also prohibited from cross subsidizing
services and is subject to accounting separation of interconnection activities.


-----

In addition, a provider of public fixed-line telephony services that has been designated as an operator
of telecommunications with significant market power on the market of fixed-line public telephony
services must enable unbundled access to the local loop and related facilities on the basis of the
following principles: objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and cost orientation and is subject
to price control.

_Audiovisual Media Services_

The provision of audiovisual media services is subject to a license by the CRA. Such services must be
provided on a non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with the law and the terms of the license. A
licensee may not restrict access to subscribers based on their nationality, religious beliefs, financial
strength or any other grounds nor is it entitled to make a selection of programs in a manner that favors
the interests of only one national or religious community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The licensee is
required to offer the services to all citizens in the technical coverage zone and each person that accepts
the single and non-discriminatory conditions is entitled to enter into a subscription contract. Prior to the
inclusion of any audiovisual media service or a radio media service into a service package, the licensee
is required to obtain written consents from the owners of the program content or their authorized
representatives. The distribution of such services cannot be launched before the relevant consents have
been obtained.

A license for the provision of audiovisual media services is valid for a period of ten calendar years and
may be extended. In order to extend the term of the license, the licensee must submit a request for
extension of the license at least three-months before its expiration.

###### WIND HELLAS’ BUSINESS

**Business Overview**

Wind Hellas is one of the three integrated communication providers in Greece with proprietary mobile
and fixed-line networks. It offers mobile and fixed-line telecommunication, high-speed internet services
and Pay-TV services under a unified brand and on a national basis to over 4.1 million subscribers.

Wind Hellas provides fixed-broadband and fixed-voice services, international roaming and VAS, and
mobile internet services to both residential and business customers and to other telecommunications
operators through its LTE, HSPA and GSM technologies. Wind Hellas offers unlimited data services
to all customers, and its mobile offering includes pre-paid and post-paid mobile services. As of
September 30, 2021, household and business accounts represented approximately 61% of total RGUs.
Wind Hellas owns one of the three proprietary mobile networks in Greece and is the third-largest mobile
provider in Greece, with more than 3.4 million mobile subscribers as of September 30, 2021. It is also
the third-largest fixed-line telephony provider. Its fixed-line offering includes fixed-line telephony and
broadband internet services, serving more than 0.6 million LLU & NGA subscribers as of September
30, 2021. Wind Hellas benefits from an extensive nationwide fiber optic network of approximately
6,162 kilometers (backbone and metropolitan access network) and approximately 600 kilometers of
fiber as part of the recently commenced NGA deployment. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas also
benefits from 328 points of presence in its LLU and RSS network with a coverage of approximately
79% of active lines in Greece and full access to OTE’s last-mile at regulated terms. In addition, Wind
Hellas provides Pay-TV services to residential customers through its video platform, Wind Vision,
which it launched in April 2018 and had 0.1 million platform subscribers as of September 30, 2021.

Wind Hellas continuously invests in its network to support growth initiatives and enhance its service
offering. It also accelerated investments in digital service capability to take advantage of emerging
consumer behaviour patterns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, Wind Hellas
acquired 5G spectrum, which represented a significant milestone and laid the foundation for deploying
its 5G network roll-out while providing visibility on future license payments for seven years starting
from January 2024. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas achieved 4G and 5G network coverage of
98% and 24%, respectively, of the 10.7 million population in Greece and continued investing in its fiber
network, reaching 431 thousand NGA lines deployed.

Wind Hellas has successfully scaled in the market over the past few years, and its total revenue for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2021 was €558.3 million compared to €537.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020. Its WH Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021
was €248.5 million compared to €245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Going forward,
we believe Wind Hellas could leverage other growth opportunities to further improve its performance,
including through offering fixed-mobile convergence bundles, expanding its fiber network and
introducing B2B services.

**History**

Founded in 1992 as STET Hellas, Wind Hellas received its first Greek GSM license in September 1992
and launched commercial services in June 1993. In 2004, Wind Hellas was renamed TIM Hellas, and
in 2005, it was acquired by a consortium of private equity investment funds. Weather Investments
S.p.A. subsequently acquired Wind Hellas in 2007 and renamed it Wind Hellas Telecommunications
S.A. Since then, Wind Hellas has operated under the licensed brand name “WIND.”

In 2007, Wind Hellas merged with Q Telecommunications, which provided pre-paid mobile
telecommunications services, including voice, SMS and certain VAS, and had a fixed wireless access
license and a GSM license. In 2008, Wind Hellas also acquired and merged with Tellas
Telecommunications S.A., which was the first company to provide the Greek public with innovative
fixed-line telephony services, internet access services, combined services of fixed-line telephony and


-----

internet, as well as broadband services. Following the addition of fixed-line telecommunications, Wind
Hellas became a leading integrated telecommunications provider.

In 2010, Wind Hellas began to modernize its networks across Greece in cooperation with Huawei,
investing in HSPA and offering 3.5G services. In 2012, Wind Hellas entered into an exclusive
distribution agreement with Public to distribute all of its products through Public’s network. In addition,
in June 2013, Wind Hellas agreed to partner with Vodafone-Panafon S.A., a member of Vodafone
Group plc, to establish Victus Joint Operation, a 50/50 joint operation to facilitate partial sharing of its
2G, 3G and, since 2017, 4G mobile networks.

In 2015, Wind Hellas started its LTE roll-out plan, which allowed it to quickly close its 4G outdoor
coverage gap with competitors, and in 2016, it embarked on the pilot deployment of fiber roll-out. In
2017, Wind Hellas was awarded 40 Central Office trunks in dense urban areas, covering approximately
453 thousand lines for the development of NGA fiber infrastructure. Since then, Wind Hellas has been
awarded a further 35 thousand lines, which has enabled Wind Hellas to generate wholesale revenues
from leasing lines to other operators as well as benefit from more attractive owner-economics by
moving subscribers to its own network.

In 2017, Wind Hellas launched field trials for its streaming platforms and entered into an agreement
with Nova for access to premium Nova Sports channels through its video platform. The service was
officially launched in 2018, and Wind Hellas’ offering was the first multi-device video proposition in
Greece with Netflix integration. In the same year, Wind Hellas launched a new portfolio offering
bundled mobile and fixed services with an option for additional add-on services such as mobile data,
NGA fiber and Wind Vision.

In June 2020, Wind Hellas secured one mobile lot and three fixed lots in the bidding process of the
consolidated government connectivity procurement program SYZEFXIS II, which aims to provide an
upgraded digital telecommunications infrastructure to all general government entities in Greece. In
December 2020, Wind Hellas acquired 5G spectrum in the bands of 3.4-3.8GHz, 2.1GHz, 694-790MHz
and 24.25-27.56GHz.

In 2020, Wind Hellas Parent contributed Wind Hellas’ tower portfolios in Greece into Vantage Towers
Greece, an entity jointly owned by Vodafone Europe B.V. (“Vodafone”), in exchange for 38% for the
issued share capital of Vantage Towers Greece. In March 2021, Vodafone acquired the 38% share of
Wind Hellas Parent in Vantage Towers Greece and as of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas Parent has
no investment in Vantage Towers Greece.

On August 14, 2021, we signed an agreement with the Seller to acquire Crystal Almond Midco, an
indirect parent of Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. The Wind Hellas Acquisition was approved
by the European Commission on December 21, 2021, and we expect it to be consummated on or about
January 12, 2022.

**Products and services**

Wind Hellas provides a variety of post-paid and pre-paid services, including mobile, fixed-line
telephony, broadband internet (ADSL/NGA fiber) and Pay-TV services, tailored to the needs of both
its residential and business customers. As a fully integrated telecommunications operator, in addition
to offering its products and services on a standalone basis, Wind Hellas also offers them in bundled
packages, which provides customers with the convenience of having a single operator for their
communication and information needs. Over the years, Wind Hellas’ bundled offerings, which Wind
Hellas believes are known for their “simplicity” and “value for money,” have improved in effectiveness
and gained popularity among customers.

**_Mobile_**


-----

Wind Hellas is the third largest mobile provider in Greece, with approximately 3.4 million mobile
subscribers and a market share of approximately 21% by registered mobile subscribers in Greece, in
each case as of September 30, 2021. The Greek telecommunications market is characterized by strict
market discipline that has prevailed in recent years, particularly in the mobile post-paid and pre-paid
segments. Wind Hellas estimates it had total mobile voice usage of 9.5 billion minutes in the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021, compared to 5.1 billion minutes in 2012, reflecting its strengthening
market position.

In addition to its basic mobile telecommunications services, Wind Hellas offers VAS, including
messaging services, mobile internet access, information and entertainment multimedia services,
international roaming, as well as innovative “Internet of Things” and Cloud services. Wind Hellas also
offers a variety of mobile telephony handsets, data cards, SIM cards and accessories to its customers.

Wind Hellas provides services to its mobile subscribers through GSM/GPRS, HSPA and LTE
technology and through its “WIND” and “Q” brands.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas generated mobile telecommunication
services revenue of €205.4 million, representing 52% of its WH Service Revenue in the same period.

_Mobile subscriber base_

Wind Hellas’ mobile subscribers comprise subscribers of voice services (including incoming and
outgoing calls), non-voice services (including SMS, MMS and data services for handsets) and mobile
broadband services (wireless internet access through a laptop, tablet or dongle).

Wind Hellas reports the number of subscribers in its mobile business based on the number of SIM cards
in use and not the actual number of individuals or businesses using its services. Subscribers that pay in
advance for services are counted as pre-paid mobile subscribers, and subscribers that pay periodically
through a contractual agreement are counted as post-paid mobile subscribers. Pre-paid mobile
subscribers are counted in Wind Hellas’ subscriber base if they have activated one of its SIM cards in
the previous twelve months (for new subscribers) or if they have recharged their mobile telephone credit
in the previous twelve months and have not requested that their SIM card be deactivated and have not
switched to another telecommunications operator via mobile number portability during this period (for
its existing mobile subscribers) or because fraudulent activity has occurred. Post-paid mobile
subscribers are counted in Wind Hellas’ subscriber base if they have an active contract unless their SIM
card is deactivated upon their request or because fraudulent activity has occurred.

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas had approximately 3.4 million mobile subscribers, of which
approximately 2.4 million were pre-paid mobile subscribers (registered customers).

**_Fixed-line_**

Wind Hellas’ fixed-line offering include fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services. As an
integrated operator, Wind Hellas offers comprehensive fixed-mobile convergence bundles for
consumers and businesses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas generated fixed telecommunication
services revenue of €128.9 million, representing 32% of its WH Service Revenue in the same period.
LLU & NGA fiber services, a component of Wind Hellas’ fixed-line services, accounted for 29% of its
WH Service Revenue in the same period. In addition, Wind Hellas’ market share based on total LLU
& NGA fiber lines (excluding OTE) increased from approximately 23% as of September 30, 2014, to
approximately 30% as of September 30, 2021, based on Wind Hellas’ analysis of market participant
filings.


-----

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ LLU & NGA subscriber base increased
by approximately 3% year-on-year to 0.6 million subscribers, while its churn rate decreased by
approximately 1% (to 12%) and outgoing ARPU decreased by €0.1, compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020.

_Fixed-line subscriber base_

Wind Hellas reports the number of subscribers in its fixed-line business based upon LLU & NGA. LLU
& NGA subscribers are counted as part of Wind Hellas’ subscriber base if they have an active contract.
All of Wind Hellas’ LLU & NGA subscribers are post-paid customers.

_Consumer Fixed_

Wind Hellas markets fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services to consumers through a
complete portfolio of tariff plans combining speed and bundled minutes options covering all household
needs. Additionally, Wind Hellas provides “value for money” personalized propositions to existing
consumers, promoting high and stable speeds achieved over NGA fiber network, upselling
entertainment service (e.g., Wind Vision) and consumer convergence household proposition through
mobile cross-selling.

Wind Hellas’ fixed consumer base reached 0.6 million subscribers as of September 30, 2021. As of
September 30, 2021, NGA fiber penetration of the consumer base increased to 44%, up by 21.1
percentage points compared to December 31, 2019, demonstrating Wind Hellas’ strategy to focus on
NGA speeds and superior internet experience, while gradually moving away from ADSL technology.
NGA lines accounted for approximately 63% of new fixed consumer additions as of September 30,
2021.

_Business Fixed_

Wind Hellas offers fixed-line telephony and broadband internet services to business customers tailored
to their needs and the relevant market segments (professional, SoHo, SMEs, large corporations and
public sector). Wind Hellas’ business product offerings include WIND Business Fiber and corporate
networking solutions, and a newly launched Cloud private branch exchange (“PBX”) proposition. In
addition, Wind Hellas also provides national and international wholesale services to telecommunication
providers, carriers, and VAS/IN services.

The NGA fiber & LLU subscriber base within Wind Hellas’ fixed-line business has been expanding
rapidly and reached 0.6 million subscribers as of September 30, 2021, while outgoing ARPU increased
to €20.9 primarily due to an increasing penetration of NGA fiber access lines.

**_Fixed-line and mobile convergence_**

Wind Hellas markets fixed-broadband internet and telephony services through a full portfolio of tariff
plans combining speed and bundled-minutes options covering all household needs. Additionally, Wind
Hellas provides “value for money” personalized propositions to existing customers, promoting high and
stable speeds achieved over NGA network, upselling its entertainment service (Wind Vision – IPTV)
and consumer convergence household proposition through mobile cross-selling. Wind Hellas’ fixedline offerings include fixed-line telephony and broadband internet offerings. As an integrated operator,
Wind Hellas offers comprehensive fixed-mobile convergence bundles for consumers and businesses.
In particular, Wind Hellas provides Greek households with a variety of bundled service offerings,
including double-play, triple-play and quadruple-play options. Its bundled services comprise mobile
and fixed-line telephony services, broadband internet services and Wind Vision, which provide
customers with the convenience of having a single provider for their communication and information
needs at a discount compared to purchasing individual services. Wind Hellas focuses on providing highend data-centric plans to its customers through its “more for more” and “unlimited” data plan strategy


-----

that are specifically tailored to the needs of Consumer Converged Households and business accounts.
Wind Hellas has developed a combined portfolio that provides substantial value and benefits and is
distinct to standalone products in line with this strategy. In particular, its “W” standalone mobile
portfolio served as a basis for the new Wind One bundled product offering with three tariff levels,
including a high-end unlimited data offer.

As of September 30, 2021, the churn rate of Wind Hellas’ Consumer Converged Household (i.e., the
sum of tax numbers with at least one consumer of mobile voice and one consumer of LLU & NGA fiber
products) was 12% compared to 18% as of December 31, 2018. Wind Hellas’ Consumer Converged
Household base and penetration rates have exhibited substantial growth since 2009. Wind Hellas’
Consumer Converged Households recently increased from approximately 230 thousand as of December
31, 2019, to approximately 273 thousand as of September 30, 2021, representing a 18% increase. In
addition, Consumer Converged Households’ average revenue per account (“ARPA”) was higher than
the sum of average standalone mobile and average standalone fixed ARPA. As of September 30, 2021,
ARPA stood at €49.7 in the Consumer Converged Households as opposed to €23.0 in the standalone
mobile product offering and to €20.8 in the standalone fixed-line product offering.

**_Wind Vision_**

Wind Hellas offers Pay-TV services to residential customers through its video platform, Wind Vision.
The video platform was launched in April 2018, offering rich content including, linear TV channels,
integrated third-party video on demand applications, as well as other unique features and functionalities
for enhanced content viewing. Wind Vision is offered through a DTT/IP hybrid set-top box, which is
WiFi and Bluetooth-enabled, 4k and HDR-capable, and runs on an Android TV platform, giving access
to more than 7,000 applications optimized for TV through the Google Play Store. The service is also
available on iOS and Android-based portable devices (smartphones and tablets), enabling a
‘multiscreen’ experience through a unified user interface. Wind Hellas is the first operator in Greece to
fully integrate Netflix into its video platform, followed by Vodafone TV; while the rest of the Pay-TV
platforms in Greece are still not certified to offer Netflix via their set top boxes. Although Netflix is
available in most of the Smart TVs, Wind Vision remains the only platform in Greece offering a fully
integrated user experience with Netflix, enabling via billing integration the capability to opt-in to the
Netflix service without using a credit card. Wind Vision offers two packages to existing or new fixedline customers, with a complete content line-up of well-known thematic linear channels. The “full”
package also includes premium sports content, through a wholesale distribution agreement for the local
Novasports channels. The factors that differentiate Wind Vision’s offering include the extensive feature
set available at launch (including popular functionalities such as ‘Voice Search’, program ‘Restart’ and
‘Catch-up’, personal cloud recordings, etc.) and a comprehensive roadmap. In 2020, Wind Hellas added
Chromecast, a web-player extending the ‘multiscreen’ experience to laptop and desktop PCs, and
upgraded its platform operating system to Android ‘P’ release. In addition, Wind Hellas entered into a
cooperation agreement with Amazon to integrate the ‘Prime Video’ application into its user interface.
In 2021, a number of additional features were added, including a Bluetooth-enabled remote control with
microphone, user-set TV program ‘Reminders’, ‘User-generated’ TV channel lists, on-screen ‘TV
Messages’. The Greek public broadcaster’s popular application ‘ERTflix’ was also fully integrated into
Wind Vision set top box.

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas had 0.1 million video platform subscribers. Wind Hellas’ video
platform generated revenues of €4.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

**Business divisions**

Wind Hellas provides mobile and fixed-line services throughout Greece and considers its business
operations split into three separate divisions: Consumer, Business and Wholesale.

**_Consumer_**


-----

Wind Hellas’ Consumer division comprises pre-paid mobile, post-paid mobile, fixed-line and
broadband services as well as Wind Vision. The Consumer division is further split into five distinct
areas: (i) household, which includes all of Wind Hellas’ strategic positioning, (ii) post-paid only, (iii)
fixed-line only, (iv) the ‘WIND’ pre-paid brand, and (v) the ‘Q’ pre-paid brand.

Wind Hellas believes that it will experience the most significant growth in its Consumer division
through its converged offering of mobile, fixed-line and Wind Vision bundled offerings, such as Wind
One, which was launched in 2019.

Despite the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, Wind Hellas’ customer base in its
Consumer division increased by 1% to approximately 819 thousand customers as of September 30,
2021 compared to approximately 808 thousand customers as of December 31, 2019. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ Consumer division generated revenues of €303.3 million,
accounting for 76% of its overall revenues in the same period.

_Consumer pre-paid mobile services_

Wind Hellas offers pre-paid mobile services under two brands: the ‘WIND’ brand, which is the natural
entry point into Wind Hellas’ product perimeter and targets mainly the younger population, and the ‘Q’
brand, which targets a 25 years old+ audience primarily.

Wind Hellas’ pre-paid brands are strongly focused on value management, coupled with highly effective
acquisition and customer relationship management (“CRM”) strategies, and are on the shift to highervalue products in line with its “more for more” proposition. In addition, Wind Hellas’ pre-paid brands
focus on digital capabilities via the development of state-of-the-art mobile applications, with the aim of
(i) reinforcing simplicity via digital-first single-minded propositions, (ii) pursuing best-in-class digital
consumer experience across the customer journey and (iii) engaging users digitally with the brand.

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ customer base had 1.0 million pre-paid mobile subscribers
(one-month active customers), accounting for 59% of its overall consumer mobile subscriber base,
which is a decrease of 4% from 1.1 million and a decrease of 13% from 1.2 million pre-paid mobile
subscribers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Wind
Hellas’ pre-paid mobile services generated outgoing revenues of €71.9 million, accounting for 25% of
its Consumer division outgoing revenues in the same period, and an outgoing ARPU of €7.6.

_Consumer post-paid mobile services_

Wind Hellas offers a wide range of post-paid mobile services. Wind Hellas’ consumer post-paid mobile
tariff plans consist of a monthly fee, bundled minutes, SMS and data additional monthly charges for
any traffic over the bundled usage. Wind Hellas aims to provide “value for money” services and bundled
products, with “W” being its leading plans. In 2018, Wind Hellas launched its “W” portfolio, which it
built around customer experience principles such as simplicity and data stimulation in the product
portfolio design. In particular, the WIND post-paid mobile portfolio consists of three core tariffs,
including a high-end unlimited data offer aimed at fueling data consumption and positioning WIND as
the leading data-focused operator. Additionally, the “W” portfolio design provides attractive upsell
opportunities for Wind Hellas’ customer base, in line with its strategy to extract value from its customer
base and monetize data consumption.

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ customer base had 0.7 million post-paid mobile consumer
subscribers, accounting for 41% of its overall consumer mobile subscriber base, which is an increase of
7% from 0.7 million and 10% from 0.6 million post-paid mobile subscribers as of December 31, 2020
and 2019 respectively. Over the years, Wind Hellas’ churn rate has significantly improved in both fixed
and mobile post-paid, reaching 12% and 10%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30,
2021, compared to 16% and 13%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. This
improvement was due to the implementation of Wind Hellas’ household strategy and the migration of


-----

most of its subscriber base to long-term contracts, with 75% of its subscriber base in contracts of at least
24 months as of September 30, 2021. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’
post-paid outgoing mobile services generated revenues of €102.1 million, accounting for 36% of its
overall Consumer division revenues in the same period, and an ARPU of €15.9.

**_Business_**

Wind Hellas’ Business division comprises post-paid mobile, fixed-line and broadband services. Wind
Hellas serves the full range of business customers: SoHo, small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”),
corporate and government entities, with services catered to their specific needs. Wind Hellas’ “W
Business” portfolio includes Greece’s first business price plan with an unlimited data allowance. With
WIND ONE Pro, Wind Hellas has launched the most advanced Cloud PBX proposition, allowing fixedline telephony access anywhere through a mobile app, and providing a “consumer grade” ease-to-use
self-management portal. With its mobile data and “Internet of Things” propositions in combination with
the recently launched 5G network, Wind Hellas believes it is well-positioned to benefit from the
increased digitization across all sectors. In addition, Wind Hellas has recently expanded into the
Information and Telecommunication Technologies (“ICT”) space, which represents a sizeable market
opportunity, also driven by the fact that approximately €4 billion from the EU Recovery and Resilience
Facility are expected to be channelled towards digitization projects in the public sector in Greece.

Despite the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, Wind Hellas’ customer base in its Business
division increased by 8% to 84 thousand customers as of September 30, 2021 compared to 78 thousand
customers as of December 31, 2019.

**_Wholesale_**

Wind Hellas’ Wholesale division comprises NGA fiber wholesale, wholesale voice, transit and
wholesale VAS services. Following the decision of the Greek National Telecommunications and Post
Commission (the “NTPC”) in 2017 via its Vectoring Plan to assign specific areas for NGA roll-out to
each operator, Wind Hellas has been able to generate wholesale revenues by leasing lines in its own
NGA network to other operators, while reducing LLU costs by moving subscribers to its own network.
For more details, please refer to “—Network and Facilities—Network Strategy.”

As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ had 92 thousand wholesale customers. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas’ wholesale revenues were €35.5 million, accounting for 9% of
its WH Service Revenue in the same period.

**Distribution network**

Wind Hellas distributes its products and services through a wide range of distribution channels, covering
the whole of Greece. These channels include Wind exclusive stores, stores operated by Public’s retail
chain, as well as other major retail outlets with whom Wind Hellas has commercial agreements in place,
such as the Dixons/Kotsovolos retail chain. In addition, Wind Hellas uses online sales channels,
including its own website and the website of numerous affiliated partners, as well as telemarketing
activities for CRM campaigns. An extensive network of field agents and pre-paid agents, covering all
54 prefectures of Greece ensures national and targeted regional sales capabilities for pre-paid
distribution and fiber door-to-door sales. In addition, the Business segment is served through a direct
sales force that targets corporate business customers, as well as an indirect sales force for SMEs and
SoHos.

**_Wind stores_**

Wind Hellas operates a closely managed Wind-branded distribution network of franchisees across
Greece. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas had 195 Wind stores across all prefectures and major
cities of Greece (mainland and islands), exclusively selling Wind products and services. Wind Hellas
has undertaken several initiatives to strengthen its brand image and increase customer satisfaction and


-----

efficiency in recent years. In 2018, it launched a full-scale store renovation program and renovated 185
stores. The renovation program included relocating stores to more attractive locations, rationalizing the
store network footprint, optimizing overall rent expenses by taking advantage of real estate
opportunities, and implementing a frontline IT system upgrade and integration to enable best-in-class
CRM activities. Moreover, Wind Hellas made significant investments to create an NGA fiber and Wind
Vision-related section within its shops to promote its new product offerings. On the back of all these
initiatives, sales generated from Wind stores have increased to an average monthly contribution of 70%
of Wind Hellas’ total sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, while Wind Stores remained
open despite the lockdown measures implemented in Greece in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
they have collectively experienced a drop in traffic of approximately 25%. However, this was
counterbalanced by improved sales conversion rates (i.e., the ratio between successful sales and
customer visits at Wind stores), resulting in a 10% increase in annual sales, which has kept Wind stores
sales contribution at 70% of overall sales.

**_Stores of Public_**

In 2012, Wind Hellas entered into a 15-year exclusive commercial agreement with Public to distribute
products and services through its stores in Greece.

Public is a major retailer in Greece for smartphones and tablets and TVs, with a fast-growing electronics
distribution online network platform, offering a wide selection of products including audio, video,
books, computing and mobile. As of September 30, 2021, Public operated a network of 52 stores in
Greece covering all major cities. Wind Hellas’ key priority is to develop its fixed and TV propositions
further through the network of Public, taking advantage of its high traffic and TV hardware sales, with
a particular focus on innovative and appealing bundle offers. In 2020, this retail channel was negatively
impacted by the lockdown measures implemented in Greece in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For a significant portion of the year, retail stores remained closed or were impacted by restrictive
shopping measures, which resulted in a drop in its sales contribution, which however was absorbed by
sales via online channels.

**_Online sales and digital activities_**

Wind Hellas’ online sales and digital CRM initiatives have increased in recent years and have driven
its online presence and enhanced customer experience. Online pre-paid top-up revenue increased by
24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with online top-ups comprising 27% of its total
pre-paid recharge revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to 22% and 15%
in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Wind Hellas has also developed a so-called “Phygital” channel, combining features of both digital and
physical sales channels by allowing customers to respond to social media digital campaigns with a
“click-to-call” request and receive a call-back from an outbound telesales agent to service their requests,
completing the relevant application and sending the contract for signature. Wind Hellas significantly
accelerated its online customer acquisition both on a digital basis and through inbound “click-to-call”
traffic through its Phygital channel. Digital and Phygital channels combined accounted for
approximately 10% of Wind Hellas’ overall post-paid sales in the nine months ended September 30,
2021, compared to approximately 5% and 3% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, the Phygital channel was ramped up by expanding
online campaigns on affiliated partners’ website sites, to counterbalance the drop in sales of its doorto-door sales channels, which were negatively impacted by the lockdown measures implemented in
Greece. Sales from affiliated partners’ websites represented approximately 52% of Wind Hellas’ total
digital and Phygital sales and 5% of its overall sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. In
connection with the re-opening of Wind Hellas’ door-to-door channels following the ease of the


-----

lockdown measures, Wind Hellas’ overall sales capacity increased compared to before the beginning
of the pandemic.

**Branding and marketing Branding**

Wind Hellas operates under the “WIND” name and brand under a license agreement with Wind
Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. The “WIND” brand was established in June 2007 and nowadays represents
one of the key players in the Greek telecommunication market. In recent years, Wind Hellas has
succeeded in enhancing its brand image and is becoming acknowledged as a dynamic and daring brand.
Wind Hellas positions itself as a trusted and fully integrated telecommunication operator with a holistic
product offering and a differentiated brand experience, built around the performance, trust and
reputation of the WIND brand.

**Customer service**

Wind Hellas has developed a simplified user-friendly product and service offering and a customer
service platform that enables it to offer best-in-class customer experience.

Wind Hellas focuses continuously on improving its customer service to further increase customer
satisfaction and decrease churn rates. Wind Hellas has dedicated teams that proactively manage
relationships with customers. It has refined its customer service processes within the last few years
across all of its divisions and currently monitors all customer service performance measures closely. In
particular, Wind Hellas has invested in upgrading its call center, installed natural languageunderstanding systems to optimize call routing and introduced self-care web services to enhance the
online customer experience. As a result, in recent years the number of total incoming calls has declined,
the average handling time of incidents has improved, and the number of repeat calls has declined in line
with an increase in first-call resolution.

In 2020, Wind Hellas’ call center exhibited high levels of customer satisfaction in terms of overall call
center experience, with “effective response” being its key positive differentiating factor. Moreover,
Wind Hellas has significantly improved its customer satisfaction across all segments and as of
December 31, 2020, its overall customer satisfaction level for consumer and business segments as well
as for technical support was 91%. In 2020, Wind Hellas had to transition all of its customer care agents
from an on-premises to a work-from-home set-up due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, it
managed to improve all the most important customer care KPIs by introducing a flexible cooperation
system between inbound customer care teams and outbound saving teams to handle call volume spikes
using an organized system of same-day call-backs. As a result, Wind Hellas is now able to sustain a
30% work-from-home set-up, whereby agents rotate on a weekly basis between work-from-home and
on-premises, which unlocks significant cost savings.

In 2020, Wind Hellas established an asynchronous digital chat team, which shows improved
productivity compared to phone agents and presently handles approximately 15,000 chats per month.
During the year, Wind Hellas expanded this team through a blended agents initiative (permitting both
phone and digital chats) which presently uses Facebook’s messenger platform, but can be expanded to
include Viber and other OTTs. To improve business continuity, decrease disruption risks and reduce
operating expenses, Wind Hellas also established a complimentary customer care team outside of
Greece, which accounts for approximately 25% of total calls.

**Network and facilities**

Wind Hellas has made significant investments in its mobile network over the years despite the economic
difficulties of Greece, and currently owns a complete spectrum portfolio. Starting in 2010, Wind Hellas
began upgrading its mobile network to Huawei’s SRAN equipment. In addition, the Victus Joint
Operation has been providing Wind Hellas with a solid platform to expand and improve its 2G/3G/4G
coverage, improve quality and generate significant cost savings and operating expense reductions
compared to expanding the network independently.


-----

In 2011, Wind Hellas renewed its rights to use GSM 900 MHz frequencies. In 2014, it also acquired
800 MHz and 2600 MHz frequencies, followed by a fast LTE roll-out. In November 2017, Wind Hellas
renewed its rights to use 1,800 MHz and was assigned three lots of 2x5 MHz for a total amount of €59.1
million, for a duration of 17 years and 10 months. In February 2017, the NTPC completed the
assignment procedure for the 26 GHz spectrum. Wind Hellas was assigned a license for one block of
2x56 MHz for a total amount of €1.0 million, for a duration of 15 years. In December 2020, Wind
Hellas acquired 5G spectrum, which represented a significant milestone and laid the foundation for
deploying its 5G network roll-out while providing visibility on future license payments for seven years
starting from January 2024.

Wind Hellas expanded its LTE sites from approximately 200 as of December 31, 2014, to more than
3,141 LTE sites as of September 30, 2021. These upgrades have expanded coverage and improved
network quality, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of calls dropped while effectively reducing
the operational costs of its network. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas estimates that its 5G
network covered approximately 24%, its 4G network covered 98%, its 3G network covered 95% and
its 2G network covered 99% of the approximately 10.7 million population of Greece, and Wind Hellas
has sufficiently addressed the coverage gap compared to its competitors.

Wind Hellas’ network architecture provides a solid base for quality service. DWDM backbone network
interconnects all major locations of its core network, supporting the evolution to full IP transport, and
the backbone transmission network employs approximately 5,450 kilometers of high resilience ring
structured fiber optic cables across Greece. Wind Hellas currently has an efficient and fully resilient
optical backbone network that fully covers its IP transport needs for both fixed-line and mobile
broadband services. It also has the potential to evolve to support even higher bandwidth needs. Wind
Hellas’ core network is modernized and fully supports its current and planned IP and LTE requirements.
As of September 30, 2021, approximately 600 kilometers of fiber was built as part of its NGA fiber
optic deployment.

On the fixed-line front, Wind Hellas benefits from approximately 328 points of presence in its LLU and
RSS network with a coverage of approximately 79% of active lines in Greece and full access to OTE’s
last-mile at regulated terms, in each case as of September 30, 2021.

Following the decision of the NTPC on the VDSL Vectoring plan in 2017, Wind Hellas was awarded
40 Central Office trunks in dense urban areas, covering approximately 453 thousand lines for the
development of NGA fiber infrastructure using FTTC Super Vectoring 35b and FttH/GPON
technologies. Since 2019, Wind Hellas was assigned an additional scope of approximately 35 thousand
lines by the NTPC, reaching a total of approximately 488 thousand vectoring lines. At the same time,
Wind Hellas deploys an extended (unregulated) FttH network in the inner ring of its Central Offices,
covering approximately 115 thousand lines. Wind Hellas estimates to cover almost 97% of active lines
using FttC/VDSL Super Vectoring and FttH/GPON technologies.

Wind Hellas manages to maintain network availability and network accessibility at very high levels as
a result of careful capacity planning and prudent site selection for directed expansion.

**_Mobile overview_**

Wind Hellas’ network is sufficiently versatile to support its VAS while simultaneously meeting
increased traffic demands and performance requirements. Its mobile network currently offers mobile
consumer services, such as voice, SMS, MMS and data services in all radio access network
technologies. Wind Hellas’ newly modernized network uses dual Carrier High Speed Downlink Packet
Access (“HSDPA”), LTE Carrier Aggregation and 5G ENDC (E-UTRAN New Radio – Dual
Connectivity) Radio Access Technology.

**_Radio network_**

Wind Hellas’ radio network has evolved to an SRAN architecture, having replaced all 2G Ericsson and
3G Nokia Siemens Network legacy base transceiver stations with Huawei’s multi-technology (SRAN)
equipment. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas reached 3,342 unique macro base station locations
throughout Greece. Wind Hellas’ RAN modernization started in 2010 and was bolstered in 2014
primarily due to the Victus Joint Operation, which brought capacity expansion, the addition of new
functionalities and the enhancement of Wind Hellas’ network infrastructure. This modernization was
also supported by the latest generation radio access technologies, namely single cabinet/SRAN
equipment and 3G coverage expansion, with new broadband offerings (42 Mbps). Wind Hellas’ RAN
modernization project has facilitated spectrum re-farming and the deployment of the LTE 800MHz,
LTE 1800MHz and LTE 2600MHz spectrum bands. Since 2014, L1800 re-farming has been initiated
on 5 MHz and starting in 2016, L1800 re-farming to 10 MHz has been extended to the rest of its
network. Wind Hellas also uses LTE Carrier Aggregation and in 2020, it introduced 5G technology on
the newly acquired 2100MHz and 3600MHz spectrum bands. ENDC technologies used by Wind Hellas
are enabled to support up to 1.5G and 4.4G carriers aggregation while the Dynamic Spectrum Sharing
(DSS) functionality is enabled on the 2100MHz spectrum band to support both 4G and 5G data services.
In addition, Wind Hellas introduced 4x4 antenna Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) functionality
on its mid-bands to further enhance its data coverage and capacity while introducing high order 64x64
MIMO at 3600MHz.

_Mobile transmission_

Wind Hellas continued to modernize its transmission network and radio network. Approximately 80
kilometers of fiber optic network (“MAN”) interconnects with its master locations (i.e., where there is
a core network presence). In addition, Wind Hellas uses circuits over DWDM to provide the required
intra-connectivity between remote core network locations.


-----

Backbone network consists of a combination of DWDM circuits and a high nationwide capacity (trunk)
microwave links (approximately 210) utilizing SDH or pure IP.

An extended transmission microwave access and aggregation network presently contains over 3,300
microwave links. In addition to microwave access, Wind Hellas utilizes MAN for sites connectivity.
As of September 30, 2021, approximately 585 sites are backhauled through fiber and IP MPLS
equipment (140 in point of connection (“POC”) locations and 445 FttS). IP MPLS network is deployed
in the core network nodes (28 IP MPLS nodes) and in the nodes that concentrate high traffic volume
(about 115 POC locations, with approximately 140 nodes) and finally in the FttS locations servicing
the site traffic (approximately 275 nodes).

_Mobile core and VAS network overview_

Wind Hellas has also developed its split architecture mobile circuit switch to include more capabilities
and a more modern network design. In 2020, it completed the transformation of the former network of
eight mobile switching servers (“MSS”) nodes and 12 Media Gateways (“MGWs”) to four new MSS
blade cluster technology nodes and eight MGWs.

All circuit switching core functionalities have been consolidated into the MSS blade cluster technology.
For subscriber management, Wind Hellas uses Ericsson’s modernized User Data Consolidation
(“UDC”). UDC enables centralization based on Data Layered Architecture. This provides a centralized
subscriber data repository to different applications (CUDB) while the business logic runs on front-end
entities. The legacy home location registry (HLR) function for 2G/3G subscribers and the High-Speed
Synchronization (HSS) function for 4G subscribers are currently running over front-end logic.

Furthermore, Wind Hellas developed an IP Multimedia System (“IMS”) network serving both mobile
(through the “Voice over LTE” service) and fixed-line subscribers. The Voice over LTE service is
commercially viable since 2019 and subscribers are gradually migrating on it. In addition, Wind Hellas’
“Voice over Wifi” Service introduction is ongoing and is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter
of 2021.

Wind Hellas’ mobile data network is deployed over Ericsson’s legacy Evolved Packet Core (“EPC”)
solution, which is a triple-access core supporting GPRS, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access
(WCDMA) and LTE simultaneously. The EPC offers an optimized network architecture, which, in
combination with LTE technology, results in higher bit rates, faster throughput, and lower latency. Since
the end of 2020, the EPC network has been configured to benefit from 5G capabilities, for example,
even higher bit rates. Wind Hellas’ mobile data network is geo-redundant, physically deployed in two
different sites in Athens. Additionally, it has been recently upgraded to support narrowband-“Internet
of Things” technology.

_VAS network_

Wind Hellas provides VAS services to subscribers (SMS, MMS, voice mailbox, etc.). Moreover, the
Ericsson NGIN platform offers mobile and fixed intelligent network services, such as maximum call
duration, premium numbers, dynamic international routing and location dependent services.

**_Fixed-line and core network_**

Wind Hellas’ fixed-line network provides voice and internet services to subscribers and corporate
customers. Wind Hellas has local equipment in OTE’s local sites across Greece for voice and internet
capabilities providing high bandwidth rates to end-users. Wind Hellas’ fiber optic access network
interconnects the majority of physical sites (200), while 94 are backhauled via leased lines and 34 via
microwave radio links. Wind Hellas offers “Voice over Broadband” (“VoBB”) and internet service with
high bandwidth rates to end-users by ADSL2+, VDSL2, and SHDSL technologies. In addition to the


-----

expanded LLU Network, in 2017, Wind Hellas started the deployment of its NGA fiber network for
ultra-high speeds utilizing vectoring techniques and GPON networks.

All of Wind Hellas’ fixed-line voice services are currently served by a common IMS system that offers
geo-redundancy and high availability. The common IMS system, which also serves mobile Voice over
LTE services, is deployed in four sites in Athens and Thessaloniki (two sites in Athens and two sites in
Thessaloniki). Fixed-voice services offered to Wind Hellas’ customers are old black line voice/LLU,
VoBB/NGA residential, SoHo, SME customers and Integrated Services Digital Network Primary Rate
Interface (“ISDN-PRI”) and SIP Trunking. At the end of 2019, Wind Hellas introduced the
Cisco/Broadworks servers’ platform, integrated with the IMS system to provide unified communication
and Cloud PBX services launched in April 2020. The Cisco/Broadworks platform is also used to host
Fixed ISDN-PRI (E1) Services, which until the third quarter of 2020 were served through legacy Timedivision multiplexing switches.

**_Fixed-line transmission and IP backbone_**

Implemented in 2008, the DWDM backbone network connects all major locations of Wind Hellas’ core
network. Its transmission backbone network benefits from an extensive fiber optic deployment of
approximately 5,450 kilometers, including approximately 1,900 kilometers of exchanges with Nova
and Vodafone Greece. The DWDM network is implemented nationwide. A significant portion of this
network, namely in the Peloponnese area and west backbone Athens-Thessaloniki, is currently capable
of providing up to 88λ of 100G each, while 44λ are installed. The rest part of backbone network – east
backbone Athens-Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki-Alexandroupoli and Chania-Heraklio in Crete – is
implemented with legacy DWDM equipment, capable of providing up to multiple λ(16, 32, 48) of
10/100G capacity. The initial DWDM modernization plan is scheduled to be completed in 2022 and the
remaining portions of the network are expected to be modernized according to traffic growth needs.
This is expected to lead to a unified NG-DWDM network, capable of supporting 100G and 200G circuit
with efficiency and cost effectiveness, given protection capability and high network availability. High
capacity circuits (STM 16, 1G, 10G and 100G) are activated through DWDM network, addressing the
needs of core fixed-line and mobile networks as well as corporate and wholesale. A legacy SDH
network is also implemented over the same optical fiber network (over DWDM), but has been gradually
reduced and is expected to be dismantled in the coming years.

Wind Hellas’ IP backbone network consists of a next-generation transport network of routers and
switches able to support converged voice and data services over IP and is a fully redundant network
based on IP MPLS technology. Wind Hellas’ core network in Athens and Thessaloniki has been recently
modernized to support high-density 100G connectivity, while the modernization of the network in
Patras and Larissa is in progress and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. New equipment
from Nokia is replacing the existing Juniper nodes. The IP backbone offers layer three and layer two
services for both its fixed-line and mobile networks.

Wind Hellas’ metro Ethernet network offers data services to its fixed-line subscribers. It is a fully
redundant network based on 100G fiber optic technology and is deployed in two metro core and six
metro aggregation sites in Athens. Metro Ethernet services are also available in Thessaloniki, Patras,
Kalamata, Larissa and Crete.

A fully modernized metro Ethernet network is available in Thessaloniki, Kalamata and Tripoli, using
state-of-the-art network equipment from Cisco Systems. Wind Hellas has also recently redesigned the
metro aggregation network in Larissa, Patra and Crete to support traffic growth and improve network
availability. Wind Hellas is also in the process of redesigning its metro access network across Greece
by extending MPLS to the access to increase capacity, improve operational efficiency and support new
services.

Wind Hellas’ OSS environment includes numerous applications, each responsible for their own part of
the business’ operation. OSS applications are function-specific and are used for technical customer


-----

support such as incident management and intelligent workflows that drive troubleshooting actions.
Being focused on the network and services, Wind OSS applications are used by network planners,
service designers, service operations, network operations, network engineering teams and technical
customer support.

**_Network strategy_**

Wind Hellas’ mobile network strategy is tailored to accommodate the increasing demand for data in the
mobile market. Wind Hellas’ goal is to be a first-tier operator in terms of network quality, with a primary
focus on 4G Carrier Aggregation and 5G. Wind Hellas has significantly increased its coverage in rural
and urban areas with lower costs by network sharing through the Victus Joint Operation with Vodafone
Greece. Under the Victus Joint Operation, Wind Hellas shares approximately 100% of rural sites and
approximately 60% of urban sites, which will provide a net gain of over 800 locations by project
completion compared to 2014.

Following the successful spectrum auction in 2014, Wind Hellas uses the acquired 800MHz band as a
key element of its strategy for quickly extending LTE coverage across Greece. Wind Hellas uses the
1800MHz band as a coverage and capacity layer while the 2600MHz band is primarily used for
capacity. Through its network-sharing project, Wind Hellas not only strengthened its 2G (900/1800
MHz) and 3G (2100MHz) footprint in line with competitors, but also leveraged its nationwide LTE
deployment. Following the successful 5G spectrum auction in 2020, Wind Hellas’ plans to fully utilize
its mid-bands (1800MHz, 2100MHz and 2600MHz) to maximize its 4G/5G capacity and 5G coverage
while continuing its frequency re-farming project (gradual for 1800MHz and via 3G shutdown for the
2100MHz) to adequately meet the rising demand for data traffic. Moreover, 5G at 3600MHz is deployed
on selected areas of commercial interest offering excellent data services, while 5G at 700MHz is mainly
deployed at rural areas for wide 5G coverage. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas has established
over 350 5G sites.

Since November 2017, Wind Hellas has started deploying NGA and offering related ultra-fast
broadband service to its customers. Wind Hellas believes that its NGA fibre investment will support
the change of its position in the fixed-line market, driven by an increase in the number of high-speed
customers. At the same time, Wind Hellas aims to introduce flexibility in its technology mix to
maximize its return on investment.

Wind Hellas has completed the modernization of several elements of its network infrastructure
including its mobile voice circuit-switch core and is in the process to complete the first phase of its
DWDM network. It has deployed IMS, migrating customers and interconnections from TDM to IP and
has introduced VoLTE. In the coming years, Wind Hellas plans to continue with the modernization of
its IP core network, its VAS systems, its Domain Name Systems (DNS) and the rest DWDM,
introducing new features and capabilities.

Wind Hellas also plans to introduce a 5G standalone (SA) network architecture through Ericsson 5GC
nodes. Through the introduction of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) Cloud, Wind Hellas aims
towards the gradual “cloudification” of its network and the introduction of increasingly intelligent and
more closed-loop and data-driven OSS solutions to achieve operational efficiency and maximize
customer experience. This is combined with its data center strategy to concentrate the core controlling
elements (control plane) in two sites and payload network elements (user plane) to two more sites, while
the remaining owned sites will be used as radio and transmission only concentration points. This data
center strategy is expected to lead to network optimization and operating expenses savings through the
optimization of four owned sites and the evacuation of two rented sites, one of which was finalized in
2021, while the other is to follow in 2022.

Through various pilot projects, Wind Hellas investigates additional options for Fixed Wireless Access
(FWA) while its network strategy is also focused on the growing demand for “Internet of Things” and


-----

vertical solutions, and it seeks to actively prepare the organization for large-scale projects such as 5G
corridors and smart power meters.

**The Vantage Towers Disposal**

In December 2020, Wind Hellas Parent, the direct shareholder of Wind Hellas Telecommunications
S.A., contributed Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A.’s tower portfolios in Greece, comprising
approximately 5,200 towers, into Vantage Towers Greece, an entity jointly owned by Vodafone, in
exchange for 38% for the issued share capital of Vantage Towers Greece and an aggregate payment of
€112.5 million from Vodafone. Through the Vantage Towers Disposal, Wind Hellas unlocked
significant value in its infrastructure, secured the long-term maintenance and development of its passive
tower assets and at the same time strengthened its active network sharing agreement with Vodafone
Greece. In March 2021, Vodafone acquired the 38% share of Wind Hellas Parent in Vantage Towers
Greece for a consideration of €287.5 million, which, together with the aggregate payment of €112.5
million made by Vodafone, brought the total value received by Wind Hellas Parent for the Vantage
Tower Disposal to €400.0 million. As of September 30, 2021, Wind Hellas Parent has no investment in
Vantage Towers Greece. As part of the Vantage Towers Disposal, Wind Hellas and Vodafone signed a
new long-term MSA, with an initial term of eight years, which can be extended, subject to certain
conditions, to a maximum of 32 years. Under the MSA, Vantage Towers Greece will be the preferred
supplier of new towers for Wind Hellas and Vodafone Greece, each of which has agreed to commit as
an anchor tenant on 250 new sites (500 in total) to be built by Vantage Towers Greece over five years
which started from November 17, 2020.

For more details on the Vantage Towers Disposal, please refer to “Wind Hellas’ Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting_
_Comparability of Wind Hellas’ Results of Operations—The Vantage Towers Disposal.”_

**The Victus Joint Operation**

In 2014, Wind Hellas and Vodafone-Panafon S.A., a member of Vodafone Group plc, established
Victus Joint Operation. The main objective of this 50/50 joint operation is to manage the radio access
and transmission networks (RAN) of its parent companies and implement a partial active radio network
sharing (RAN sharing) to facilitate partial sharing of 2G, 3G and 4G mobile networks, mostly in rural
and limited urban areas of Greece. The Victus Joint Operation started its operations the same year, with
the first shared sites established at the end of 2014. The sharing project between Vodafone Greece and
Wind Hellas’ rural and urban networks is expected to be completed in 2022, after which each party will
maintain independent spectrum usage. Following the Vantage Towers Disposal, Wind Hellas has also
put in place a five-year framework for cooperation with respect to a shared 4G/5G network
modernization and coverage enhancement.

**Fiber Asset Separation**

On January 3, 2021, Wind Hellas transferred its fiber network business, including its 6,162 kilometers
fiber optic network and certain other related assets, and related wholesale activities by way of demerger
into FiberCo, a newly established and separate subsidiary of Crystal Almond Midco. We estimate the
fiber network business contributed €10.2 million to WH Adjusted EBITDAaL for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021, and €5.4 million to WH Last Two Quarter Adjusted EBITDAaL basis for
September 30, 2021.

Following completion of the carve-out of Wind Hellas’ fiber assets and in order to fund the fiber rollout, FiberCo, as borrower, will enter into a senior term loan facility providing loans for an aggregate
amount of up to €92 million (up to 50% of which will be provided through the European Commission’s
Recovery and Resilience Facility) and a revolving credit facility for the issuance of letters of guarantees
and/or letters of credit for an aggregate amount up to €16 million (which combined amount shall not
exceed an aggregate amount of €100 million) with Eurobank S.A. and certain other financial
institutions, as lenders, and Wind Hellas Parent, as third party security provider. For a description of


-----

this financing, please refer to “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Wind Hellas’ Fiber
_Assets Financing.” FiberCo is an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Bridge Facilities and therefore is_
not subject to the covenants included therein. On the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, FiberCo
is expected to be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the existing Indentures and the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, and therefore not to be subject to the covenants therein. In addition, FiberCo
will be an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the SSN Indenture and therefore will not be subject to the
covenants included therein.

**Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

On July 13, 2017, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a super senior revolving credit
facility agreement (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”) with, among others, UniCredit
Bank AG, London Branch as facility agent, UniCredit Bank AG, London Branch as English security
agent, UniCredit Bank Serbia JSC Belgrade as Serbian security agent, UniCredit Bank Serbia JSC
Belgrade as payment agent and the financial institutions named therein as arrangers and lenders. In
connection with the 2019 Refinancing, pursuant to an additional facility notice dated May 3, 2019, the
Company received additional commitments from certain Existing Revolving Credit Facility Lenders in
an aggregate amount equal to € 100 million in relation to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
increasing the commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility from €100 million to €200
million with effect from May 14, 2019. Pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement to the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated 31 July 2020 (with an effective date of 5 August
2020), among other things, (a) the maturity of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility was extended to
July 15, 2025 (with such maturity automatically being reduced to (i) February 1, 2024, if the Existing
2024 SSNs are not fully refinanced by such date or (ii) February 15, 2025, if the Existing Floating Rate
Notes are not fully refinanced by such date) and (b) the commitments under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement were increased to €250. On July 29, 2021, the Company received additional
commitments from certain lenders in respect of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate
amount of €75 million, increasing the total commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
from €250 million to €325 million, in connection with the Existing Revolving Credit Facility 2021
Increase. The facilities under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are referred to as the
“Existing Revolving Credit Facility.”

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower thereunder in
euros, U.S. dollars and (other than in respect of loans by a Serbian Lender (as defined below)), Sterling
or any other currency which is readily available and freely convertible into euro, by the drawing of cash
advances, the issuance of letters of credit, bank guarantees and/or the establishment of ancillary
facilities. The Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be used for (directly or indirectly) financing or
refinancing the general corporate purposes and/or working capital requirements of the Group
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, capital expenditure and/or acquisitions).

In addition to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
includes the ability to incur additional facilities either as new facilities or additional tranches of the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain conditions being met.

Due to Serbian foreign exchange regulations and the National Bank of Serbia registration requirements,
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for (i) loans to borrowers incorporated in
Serbia (or its affiliates) (“Serbian Borrowers”) to be made only by a bank duly incorporated under the
Serbian banking and company laws and lending out of an office in Serbia (“Serbian Lender”) and (ii)
loans to borrowers which are not Serbian Borrowers to be made only by banks or entities which are not
Serbian Lenders. Payments between such Serbian Lenders and Serbian Borrowers shall be made
through a payment agent.

The final maturity date of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility following the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility Extension and 2020 Increase is July 15, 2025 (with such maturity automatically being
reduced to (i) February 1, 2024, if the Existing 2024 SSNs are not fully refinanced by such date or (ii)
February 15, 2025, if the Existing Floating Rate Notes are not fully refinanced by such date) (the
“Maturity Date”), and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized until the date falling one
month prior to the Maturity Date.

**_Interest and Fees_**


-----

Loans under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per
annum equal to LIBOR or, for loans denominated in euro, EURIBOR, plus a margin of 3.50% per
annum (which is subject to reduction in accordance with a ratchet linked to the leverage ratio). Loans
made by a Serbian Lender to a Serbian Borrower will bear an additional margin of 1.10% per annum.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility until the end of the availability period for the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 35% of the margin applicable to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility from time
to time. Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is required to be guaranteed by each Material Subsidiary
(defined to include any member of the Group with more than 5% of the consolidated EBITDA
calculated on a last twelve months basis or gross assets of the Group) and additional members of the
Group required to ensure that guarantors represent at least 80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the
Group calculated on a last twelve months basis and 80% of the gross assets of the Group subject to and
in accordance with the agreed security principles set out in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility is secured by certain material assets of such guarantors subject
to and in accordance with the agreed security principles set out in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

The agreed security principles in the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provide that certain
assets will not be pledged (or the liens not perfected):

- if providing such security would be prohibited by general statutory limitations, financial assistance,
capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “earnings stripping,” “controlled
foreign corporation” or “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims and
similar matters or providing security would be outside the applicable pledgor’s capacity or conflict
with fiduciary duties of directors or cause material risk of personal or criminal liability after the use
of reasonable endeavors to overcome such obstacle;

- if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the lenders;

- if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of the entity in
question (the “Relevant Entity”) in a particular category of assets, only the material assets in that
category will be subject to security;

- if certain security may be provided by the Relevant Entity granting a promise to pledge coupled
with an irrevocable power of attorney as opposed to a definitive legal mortgage or pledge over the
relevant asset;

- if it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security
over certain categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets;

- if providing such security requires consent before such assets may be secured or where providing
such security would give a third-party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits
and/or obligations of the borrower, guarantors or any of its subsidiaries in respect of those assets or
require any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to
certain conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

- if providing such security would have a material adverse effect (as reasonably determined in good
faith by such subsidiary) on the ability of such subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in


-----

the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the indenture and any requirement under the agreed
security principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject
to this principle;

- if the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes relating to the provision of
security exceeds an agreed amount;

- if the assets are, or the relevant member of the Group is, located outside the security jurisdictions,
which are Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands and Luxembourg;

- in the case of security from or over, or over assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any
minority interest or any entity that is not wholly-owned; and

- in the case of assets subject to security in favor of a third-party.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and
warranties (subject to customary qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being
repeated).

**_Covenants_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and
related definitions (with certain adjustments) that are set forth in the indenture governing the Existing
Notes. In addition, the Existing Revolving Facility Agreement requires the Group to comply with a
springing financial covenant consisting of a maximum Leverage Ratio.

**_Events of Default_**

The Existing Revolving Credit Facility contains events of default which are, with certain adjustments,
the same as those applicable to the Senior Secured Notes and set forth in the section entitled
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Events of Default.” These events of default (which are
subject to certain materiality exceptions and cure periods) entitle the Majority Lenders (as defined
therein) to accelerate all or part of the utilization and terminate their commitments and to enforce the
guarantees and security under or in relation to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

**Bilateral Facilities**

From time to time, we enter into bilateral facilities with certain of our local lenders. Following the

secured or unsecured basis (subject to certain restrictions) and may be effected in whole or in part by

or replacement indebtedness is treated in the same manner as the Senior Facilities (meaning that for the

the Parent shall be entitled to require that all or any part of the liabilities in relation to Hedging Liabilities
and/or the Operating Facility Liabilities shall rank in right and priority of payment pari passu with that
Priority Facility (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may result in such Hedging Liabilities and/or, as
the case may be, Operating Facility Liabilities ranking ahead of the Senior Notes liabilities, the
Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent
Financing Liabilities) in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements.

Any Priority Facility implemented pursuant to a Debt Refinancing shall comply with, among others,
the following limitations:

_Ranking of a Priority Facility_

No liabilities or obligations in respect of any Priority Facility may rank in right and priority of payment
ahead of the Senior Lender Liabilities (other than amounts of the type set out in paragraphs (i) and (ii)
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”).


-----

Subject to the paragraph above and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing
Agreements, any Priority Facility shall rank in right and priority of payment as determined by the
Parent.

_Enforcement: Priority Facility_

The right of the lenders or other creditors in respect of a Priority Facility to:

(b) instruct the Security Agent to enforce the security;

(c) give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the security as they see fit; and/or

(d) otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group,

shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other Secured Parties
than, those customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Facility (if any), in each case as
at the date such Priority Facility is contractually committed by the relevant member(s) of the Group and
as determined by the Parent (with any such determination to be conclusive).

_Option to Purchase_

(b) The Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided with
an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility
consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation to the
Senior Lender Liabilities as set out under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior
_Secured Liabilities—Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior_
_Financing Creditors.”_

(c) The Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative(s) shall be
provided with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority
Facility consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right as set out under
the paragraph captioned “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement—Option to Purchase: Senior
_Parent Creditors.”_

_Supplemental Security_

Without prejudice to the provisions set out under the caption “—Ranking and Priority” and “—
_Application of Proceeds” and the other rights of the Debtors under the Intercreditor Agreement and the_
debt documents, if any member of the Group enters into any hedging agreement or Operating Facility
Document at any time after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (which is not already secured by the
Relevant Original Transaction Security), any Debtor may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, at any time grant to the relevant Hedge Counterparty or, as the case may be, Operating
Facility Lender Supplemental Security securing all or any Hedging Liabilities arising under the relevant
hedging agreement or, as the case may be, all or any Operating Facility Liabilities arising under the
relevant Operating Facility Document. A Debtor may grant Supplemental Security to any secured
creditor in connection with all or any part of any New Debt Financing.

The Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries agree that Supplemental Security may be
granted by any Debtor in order to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities, any Operating
Facility Liabilities and/or any New Debt Financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set out this caption shall:

(b) restrict the rights of the Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries to enforce and/or
to release all or any part of the Relevant Original Transaction Security in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents; or


-----

(c) restrict, limit or prejudice the rights and other benefits of the Debtors or any member of the
Group under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

Each of the Secured Parties agrees not to take any action to challenge the validity or enforceability of
the Supplemental Security by reason of it being expressed to be second ranking (or any other lower
ranking).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Senior Parent Liabilities and Security” below,
the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Debtors (other than any Senior
Parent Debt Issuer to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted
Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or the borrower) to the Primary
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank in right and priority of payment in the following
order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(b) _first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing_
Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender
Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities, the Senior Arranger Liabilities, the
Second Lien Arranger Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes
Trustee, the Second Lien Agent Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee
pari passu and without any preference amongst them; and

(c) _second, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari_
passu and without any preference amongst them,

The liabilities owed by any Senior Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of
Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the
issuer or the borrower) to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank pari passu
in right and priority of payment without any preference amongst them.

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security shall secure the liabilities (but only to the extent
that such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

(b) _first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing_
Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Senior Arranger
Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee, the Second
Lien Agent Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee pari passu and
without any preference amongst them;

(c) _second, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities_
and the Second Lien Arranger Liabilities pari passu and without any preference amongst them;
and

(d) _third, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari_
passu and without any preference amongst them.

_Senior Parent Liabilities and Security_

The Senior Parent Notes liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities owed by a Senior
Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted
Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the
borrower) are senior obligations of that Senior Parent Debt Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding


-----

sentence, the Senior Parent Notes Creditors and the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors agree that,
until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, they may not take any steps subject to the Security
Documents in connection with any Enforcement Action, other than as expressly permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set out in the preceding paragraph shall not impair the right
of the Senior Parent Creditors and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors to institute suit for the
recovery of any payment due by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer in respect of the Senior Parent Liabilities
and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities (in each case to the extent relating to liabilities in
respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt
Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower).

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-group liabilities and the liabilities of the Group to
an investor are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders, but does not purport to rank any of those liabilities as
between themselves.

_Additional and/or Refinancing Debt_

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders acknowledge in the Intercreditor Agreement that the
Debtors (or any of them) may wish to incur incremental borrowing liabilities (including guarantees of
such liabilities) or refinance or replace borrowing liabilities (including incurring guarantee liabilities in
respect of such refinancing or replacement). Such liabilities are intended to rank pari passu with any
other liabilities and/or share pari passu in any security and/or to rank behind any other liabilities and/or
to share in any security behind any such other liabilities.

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders undertake in the Intercreditor Agreement (at the cost
of the Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and facilitating
such financing, refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security (provided it is not prohibited
by the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements at such time) to take place in a timely manner. In
particular, but without limitation, each of the secured parties authorizes and directs each of its respective
agents and the Security Agent to execute any amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor
Agreement and such other debt documents and/or (subject to certain pre-conditions) release and retake
of security required by the Parent to reflect, enable and/or facilitate any such arrangements (including,
as regards the ranking of any such arrangements).

If a Debtor incurs any new, additional or increased liabilities under any Secured Debt Document and/or
in connection with any Debt Refinancing, at the option of the Parent, the relevant Debtor may (but
subject to the relevant Debt Financing being elected to be secured in accordance with the applicable
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the agreed security principles) grant to the relevant
Secured Parties in respect of all or any part of such Debt Financing additional security by executing
additional security documents which will benefit from the order of priority and ranking set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities at any time.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Creditors, the Operating Facility Lenders,
the Parent and the Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the finance documents in
relation to the Senior Facilities (the “Senior Facilities Finance Documents”), the Senior Notes, the
Permitted Senior Financing Debt, the Second Lien Facility (the “Second Lien Facility Finance
Documents”), the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents and/or any Operating Facility in


-----

accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent required
under them).

_Security and Guarantees: Senior Secured Creditors_

The Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders may take, accept or receive the benefit
of:

(b) any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Liabilities in addition
to the shared security provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain agreed
security principles:

(i) the security provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not
already a party in that capacity);

Creditor or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor may take certain Enforcement Action without the prior
written consent of an Instructing Group (as defined below).

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, after

or a Debtor, each Senior Lender, Operating Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor and/or Permitted
Senior Financing Creditor may, to the extent it is permitted to do so under the relevant Debt Documents,
take certain Enforcement Action and/or claim in the winding up, dissolution, administration,
reorganization or similar insolvency event or process in relation to that Debtor for liabilities owing to
it (but no Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may direct the Security Agent to enforce
the common security in any manner).

_Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Financing Creditors_

Senior Notes Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration
event which is continuing, by giving not less than ten (10) days’ notice to the Security Agent (with the
first notice to prevail in the event that more than one set of Creditors serves such a notice), require the
transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees), in accordance with the applicable transfer provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement, of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the
Senior Lender Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities (a “Senior Liabilities Transfer”) if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms
of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Operating Facility Documents;

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Operating Facility Documents are complied with, other than:

(iii) the Senior Facility Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, is paid an amount equal to the
aggregate of:


-----

(A) any amounts provided as cash cover by the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors for
any letter of credit (as envisaged in paragraph (ii)(B) above);

(B) all of the Senior Lender Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all
amounts that would have been payable under the Senior Facilities Agreement if the
Senior Facilities were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that
payment; and

(C) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Senior Facility Agent
and/or the Senior Lenders and/or the Security Agent as a consequence of giving
effect to that transfer;

(iv) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid an amount equal to the aggregate of:

all amounts that would have been payable under the Operating Facility Documents
if the Operating Facilities were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of
that payment; and

(B) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Operating Facility
Lenders and/or the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(v) as a result of that transfer:

(A) the Senior Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a Debtor under
the Senior Facilities Finance Documents; and

(B) the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a
Debtor under the Operating Facility Documents;

(vi) an indemnity is provided from each of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors (other than any
Senior Agent) or from another third-party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders and the
Operating Facility Lenders in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender and
Operating Facility Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may
be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender or Operating Facility Lender in consequence
of any sum received or recovered by any Senior Lender or Operating Facility Lender from
any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed
back from any Senior Lender or Operating Facility Lender for any reason; or

(vii) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior
Lenders or the Operating Facility Lenders, except that each Senior Lender and Operating
Facility Lender shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer
that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to
authorize the making by it of that transfer; and

(viii) the Senior Parent Creditors have not exercised their rights to purchase as described under the
provisions set out in the paragraph captioned “—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors”
or having exercised such rights, have not failed to complete the acquisition of the relevant
Senior Secured Liabilities in accordance with such provisions.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors may only require a
Senior Liabilities Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of the Hedging Liabilities in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no Senior Liabilities Transfer may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors), the Senior
Facility Agent and the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify that Senior Agent of the foregoing
payable sums in connection with such transfer.

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, no Debtor shall make (and
the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and no Second Lien Secured
Creditor may receive from any other member of the Group, any Permitted Second Lien Payment (other
than, for the avoidance of doubt, a roll up or capitalization of any amount and Second Lien Agent
Liabilities, and payments permitted under (b) to (f) under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien
_Liabilities Payments”) if:_

(b) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(c) an insolvency event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes
Indenture and/or any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (a “Material Event of Default”) is
continuing, from the date which is one Business Day after the date on which any Senior Agent
delivers a notice (a “Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance
in relation to that Material Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Senior
Parent Agents until the earliest of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of Second Lien Liabilities, if a Second Lien Standstill Period
is in effect at any time after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, the
date on which that Second Lien Standstill Period expires;

(iii) the date on which the relevant Material Event of Default has been remedied or waived
in accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Second Lien
Agents cancelling the Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(v) the Senior Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent or a Second Lien Agent takes Enforcement
Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the
immediately prior Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice
may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Material Event of Default more than 75 days after
the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Material Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the
right of the Agents to issue a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of
circumstances. No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served by an Agent in respect of a
Material Event of Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Second Lien Debt Documents as a result of the issue of a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i)
the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement) as a


-----

consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien Debt Document;
or (ii) the issue of a Second Lien Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Second Lien
Secured Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which
shall continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Debt Document by the operation of the provisions set
out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Secured
_Creditors and Second Lien Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any_
time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Debt Documents
shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding
and/or, as the case may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Secured Creditors an amount equal to any
Payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents and which would have
been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other Debt
Document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of Payments shall be waived and
any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default
shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien
Secured Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

(i) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require
the enforcement of any security; and/or

(ii) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in
relation to the Second Lien Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement” below, provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be_
taken except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to
direct such action.

**_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_**

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured
_Creditors,” the restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on_
_Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(i) an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement, a “Second Lien
Event of Default”) (the “Relevant Second Lien Default”) is continuing;


-----

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Second Lien Default specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien Default from the relevant Second
Lien Agent;

(iii) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Second Lien Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Second Lien Standstill
Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Second Lien Event of Default, the relevant Second Lien Agent
may by notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the
existence of such Second Lien Event of Default.

_Second Lien Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period
beginning on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent serves a
Second Lien Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Second Lien Event of
Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date;

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) take any
Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor,
provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined herein) ends pursuant to
this paragraph, the Second Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action
in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement
Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors)
against such Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor and not against any other
member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or a particular
Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a
cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of
the Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior
Noteholders) and any Senior Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Facility or on any
Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the
amounts outstanding on that Second Lien Facility or on that Permitted Second Lien Financing
Debt, as the case may be (provided that, unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred
or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity
does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after July 27, 2017).

_Subsequent Second Lien Facility Defaults_

The Second Lien Secured Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in
caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if,
at the end of any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien
Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Second Lien Event of Default.


-----

_Enforcement on Behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Agents that it is enforcing Security created pursuant
to any Security Document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor, no
Second Lien Secured Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the
caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” against that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien
Guarantor (or any Subsidiary of that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor) while the
Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in accordance with the instructions of an
Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement
or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Second Lien Agent(s) (on behalf of the Second Lien
Secured Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
Senior Notes Indenture or in relation to any Permitted Senior Financing Debt which is continuing, by
giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Second Lien
Secured Creditors (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and
obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, any Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of
the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes
Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior
Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant
Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant
Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility
Liabilities);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the
case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any
Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted
Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities) and/or
any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities
remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) are complied with, in each
case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the applicable Senior Notes
Trustee (on behalf of the relevant Senior Noteholders), the applicable Senior Creditor
Representative (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) and the
Operating Facility Lenders is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent
liability to the Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Second Lien Secured Creditor (other than any Second Lien
Agent) (or from another third-party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes
Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders) in a
form reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior
Financing Creditor and Operating Facility Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and
liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor,
Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum
received or recovered by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing


-----

it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor,
Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender for any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or the Operating Facility
Lenders, except that each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor and Operating Facility Lender shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on
the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all
necessary action to authorize the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second
Lien Secured Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time,
they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any
reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of
Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

At the request of a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured Creditors), the Senior
Facility Agent, any relevant Senior Notes Trustee, any relevant Senior Creditor Representative and the
Operating Facility Lenders shall notify the Second Lien Agents of the foregoing payable sums in
connection with such transfer.

Creditors in respect of the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities,
in accordance with the Senior Parent Notes Indenture and the Permitted Parent Financing Documents,
as applicable.

**_Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, and until the Second Lien
Discharge Date, except with the Required Second Lien Consent, no Senior Parent Debt Issuer shall
make (and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and neither the
Senior Parent Notes Trustee, any holder of Senior Parent Notes or the Permitted Parent Financing
Creditors may receive from any other members of the Group, any Permitted Senior Parent Payment
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, a roll up or capitalization of any amount and certain amounts
due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its own account, payments funded by amounts not received
from another member of the Group or payments funded by Permitted Parent Financing Debt and/or the
proceeds of any indebtedness incurred or pursuant to any Senior Parent Notes) if:

(b) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or


-----

(c) an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture and/or
any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (a “Senior Event of Default”) (other than a Senior
Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which
any of the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor
Representative (together, the “Senior Agents”) delivers a payment stop notice (a “Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Event of
Default to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative until the earliest of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent
Financing Liabilities, if a Parent standstill period is in effect at any time after delivery
of that payment stop notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

(iii) the date on which the relevant Senior Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee and the Senior Parent Creditor Representative cancelling the Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice;

(v) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date; and (vi) the date on which the Security Agent,
the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative take
Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative waive this
requirement, (i) a new Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360
days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice; and
(ii) no Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Senior
Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Senior Event
of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the
right of the Senior Agents to issue a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event
or set of circumstances. No Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Agent in
respect of a Senior Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agents at the time at which
an earlier Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent
Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence
of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in
any Senior Parent Notes Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing Documents, as applicable) as a
consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Notes Indenture
and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice
(as defined below) on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from the liability
to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior
Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the
provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent


-----

_Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any_
time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Notes Indenture
and any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior
Parent Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Senior Parent Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default, that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding
and/or, as the case may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior
Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any Senior Parent
Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which would have been
Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Payment Default, then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision
under any other debt document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be waived and any Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which may have been
issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further
action being required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the relevant Senior Parent Debt
Issuers and other Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes finance documents
and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their respective terms from time
to time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group:

(i) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the
enforcement of, any security; and/or

(ii) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation
to the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of any member of the
Group under the Senior Parent Notes finance documents and/or Permitted Parent Financing
Documents, except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—
_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” below, provided, however, that no such action required_
by the Security Agent need be taken except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled
under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

**_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_**

The restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on
_Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(i) an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and any
Permitted Parent Financing Agreement, as applicable, each a “Senior Parent Event of Default”)
(the “Relevant Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;


-----

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent Default from the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as the case may be);

(iii) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent
Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee
or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a “Senior Parent
Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such Senior Parent Event
of Default.

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period
beginning on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent serves a
Senior Parent Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Senior Parent Event
of Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Parent
Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Parent Notes and/or any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior
Parent Guarantor”), provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant
to this paragraph, the Senior Parent Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in
relation to the Senior Parent Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured
Parties against such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a
particular Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of
a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of
the Majority Senior Lenders), the Second Lien Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Second Lien Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior
Noteholders), any Senior Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) and any Second Lien Creditor Representative (acting on
the instructions of the Majority Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors) has been obtained;
and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding on any Senior Parent Notes or on any
Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts
outstanding on the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case
may be (provided that (i) unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise
agreed by the Majority Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall
on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after July 27, 2017; and (ii) if any Second Lien
Debt has been incurred, unless the Second Lien Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as
otherwise agreed by the Majority Second Lien Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity
does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after July 27, 2017).

_Subsequent Senior Parent Event of Default_


-----

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption
“—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default even
if, at the end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Parent
Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Parent Agents that it is enforcing security created pursuant
to any security document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor may take
any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent
_Enforcement” above against that Senior Parent Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Senior Parent_
Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in accordance with the
instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect
such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Subject to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below any of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative (on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under
any of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes or in relation to any Permitted Senior Financing
Debt which is continuing, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the
transfer to the Senior Parent Creditors (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights,
benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities
if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of
the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), the Second Lien
Facility Agreement (in the case of the Second Lien Lenders Liabilities), any Senior Notes
Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior
Notes liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant
Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities), any Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement pursuant to which any
relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the
Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents
pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of
the Operating Facility Liabilities) (as applicable);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the
case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), the Second Lien Facility Agreement (in the case of the
Second Lien Lenders Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior
Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes liabilities), any Permitted Senior
Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities
remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities), any Permitted
Second Lien Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant Operating
Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) are
complied with, in each case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the Senior Notes Trustee
(on behalf of the relevant Senior Noteholders), the applicable Senior Creditor Representative
(on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Creditors), the Operating Facility
Lenders, the Second Lien Facility Agent (on behalf of the Second Lien Lenders) and the
applicable Second Lien Creditor Representative (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditors) is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Second Lien Lenders, the Senior Noteholders,
the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and
the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to the Parent or any
other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Parent Creditor (other than any Senior Parent Agent)
(or from another third-party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders, the Second Lien Lenders, the
Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders) in a form reasonably satisfactory to
each Senior Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor and Operating Facility Lender in respect
of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior
Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor,
Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any
sum received or recovered by any Senior Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor,
Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid
back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor,
Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender for any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
the Second Lien Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors,
the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors or the Operating Facility Lenders, except that
each Senior Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor and Operating Facility Lender shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate
power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the making by it
of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor
Representative (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior
Secured Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the
Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

At the request of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative (on
behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors), the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee, any
relevant Senior Creditor Representative, the Operating Facility Lenders, the Second Lien Facility Agent
and any relevant Second Lien Creditor Representative shall notify the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and
any Senior Parent Creditor Representative of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such
transfer.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member
of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group
in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall (in the case of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender,
only to the extent that such distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject
to the provisions set out below under the caption “—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress
event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject
to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to
the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member
of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured


-----

Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged by
way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that
member of the Group, any Creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which benefited from that setoff shall (in the case of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such
distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out
below under the caption “—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by
the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment
instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the
amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”
below and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below, if the Security
Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any
of the liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that
the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor (or, following an acceleration
event which is continuing, any member of the Group), each Creditor and each Operating Facility Lender
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
against that member of the Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the
Group’s liabilities; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each Creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent (acting in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) reasonably requests in order to give effect to
the matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the
Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” section or if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the_
Intercreditor Agreement) requests that a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender take that action,
undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power
of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) may reasonably require, although neither the Senior Notes
Trustee nor the Senior Parent Notes Trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of
attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender receives or recovers from any member of the Group:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or, following the occurrence of a Senior Distress
Event which is continuing, any Senior Lender Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Senior Notes
liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities;


-----

(ii) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event;
_Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it_
which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, other than as referred to in the second paragraph
of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress
event (including as a result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the
Group other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
member of the Group); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of
a distress event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below the caption “—Application of Proceeds;”

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set
out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds;” or

(v) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account
of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and
which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
member of Group, that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender will, subject to certain exceptions:
(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions and
any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
(y) subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information the Security
Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or
recovered by way of set-off, subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant
information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an
Instructing Group; (ii) if required as set out in the third paragraph of this section, the Majority Second

_Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” above, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, may give_


-----

or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the
security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to
enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group,
and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the
Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Second
Lien Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under the provisions under
the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above.

Prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security
Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an
Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a
distressed disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which
the Majority Senior Parent Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under
the provisions under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above.

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no secured party shall have any
independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any rights or
powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent in the manner
contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—

Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not
given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Second Lien
Creditors; or

(d) prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the

the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions,

Agent may elect to take no action).

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than the Senior Notes Trustee
and the Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each Operating Facility Lender shall agree with the Security
Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial
or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar
proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The Security
Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive,


-----

reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed
to that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to
require that the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that
any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security
or of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the
secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security Agent, then
that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in accordance with
instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and
for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender).

**_Consultation Period_**

(b) Subject to paragraph (d) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce
the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other Enforcement
Action, the creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented in the Instructing
Group concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each
other creditor representative, each other Hedge Counterparty, each Operating Facility Lender
and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group
for a period of not less than 30 days from the date on which details of the proposed instructions
are received by such creditor representative(s), Hedge Counterparties, Operating Facility
Lenders and the Security Agent (or such shorter period as each creditor representative, Hedge
Counterparty, Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation
Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be
entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or refrain or cease
from enforcing the security or take any other Enforcement Action.

(c) Subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event conflicting instructions are received from any other
Instructing Group, the Security Agent shall enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing
the security or, as the case may be, take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance
with the instructions given by an Instructing Group referred to in paragraph (a)(i)(A) of the
definition of Instructing Group as set out above (in each case provided that such instructions
are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents) and the terms of all instructions given by any other Instructing Group shall be
deemed revoked.

(d) Prior to the Senior Lender Discharge Date, if:

(i) the Senior Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the first
Consultation Period;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the security (or a transaction
in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three-months of the end of the first
Consultation Period; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any
enforcement of the security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement
Action at that time, then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the


-----

Majority Senior Creditors (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent
with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
security documents).

(e) Subject to paragraph (c) above, no Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in
accordance with paragraph (a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement Action
prior to the end of a Consultation Period (in each case provided that such instructions are
consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the Creditors represented in the
Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor
representative, the Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such
consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the security
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security,

and, where this paragraph (d) applies:

(1) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or
preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of
which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in relation to the
matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

(2) the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first
received.

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of any instructions from an Instructing
Group to enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the security or, as the case may
be, take any other Enforcement Action, the Security Agent shall provide a copy of such
instructions to each Agent, Hedge Counterparty and Operating Facility Lender (unless it
received those instructions from that person).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors acknowledges that,
in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the
First/Second Lien Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed
to the Senior Parent Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the
exploitation, management or realization of any of that security shall, subject to the section entitled
“Distressed Disposals” below, be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security
Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):


-----

(i) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the
subject of:

(A) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Senior
Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, the Second Lien Facility
Agreement, any Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes
Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing
Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the Group, but without prejudice to
any obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide
replacement security); or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement
pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(ii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver
in respect of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any
obligations or take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the
extent not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

(iii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member
of the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor (or will cease to be a Debtor simultaneously with
such release); and

(iv) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the
extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of
any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any
Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor (including in connection with the resignation
of that Debtor or the Debtor being designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the Security Agent (on
behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Parent) promptly release (or procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries (and its and their
assets) from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals” section, the
Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal
or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(ii) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in
accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements, and the Security Agent shall be
entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without the
need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating
Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into and deliver such documentation
and/or take such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release
or other matter described above.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Parent in
accordance with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and provided that the requested
action is not expressly prohibited by any of the other Debt Financing Agreements), the Security Agent
and the other Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, the
relevant Additional Security Provider and/or the Parent) promptly execute any guarantee, security or
other release and/or any amendment, supplement or other documentation relating to the Security


-----

Documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and the Security
Agent is authorized to execute, and will promptly execute if requested by the Parent, without the need
for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender, any such release or document on behalf of the Creditors and the Operating Facility
Lenders). When making any request pursuant to this paragraph (d) the Parent shall confirm in writing
to the Security Agent that such request is in accordance with the terms of a Debt Financing Agreement
(and the requested action is not expressly prohibited by way of any of the other Debt Financing
Agreements) and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under
the Secured Debt Documents.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Debt Document, nothing in any Security Document
shall operate or be construed so as to prevent any transaction, matter or other step not prohibited by the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Debt Financing Agreements (a “Permitted Transaction”).
The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) hereby agrees (and is irrevocably
authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any Party) that it shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly execute
any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document
(or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any Security Document) as is requested by the Parent
in order to complete, implement or facilitate a Permitted Transaction.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or
reduction of the Senior Liabilities then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent
of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Finance Documents and such application
shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other
discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right
of any member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment,
redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent permitted
or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at
the cost of the Parent):

(i) release the security; and

(ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities,
undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being
effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become
enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by
enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or
(c) being disposed of to a third-party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, or the Parent and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured
Party or Debtor):

(i) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter
into any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of


-----

any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent,
be considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing
liabilities, its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets; and

(C) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that
Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain
creditor representatives;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor, to release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part
of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that
holding company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain
creditor representatives;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed
by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will
be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part
of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other
provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of: all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary
Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders and all or part of any other liabilities and the
Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and
Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with


-----

the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all
or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that
Disposed Entity in respect of the intra- group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group
liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors
to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those
obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those intra- group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving
Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group
liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of
constituted charged property), as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant
security interest and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if
that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take
reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security
Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities
in order to achieve a higher price).

Where Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect
to have those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities transferred to the
Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at
the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to execute
such documents as are required to so transfer those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or
Other Liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following two paragraphs, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by
or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless
the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer
or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or
disposal is made pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to
participate or where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in
respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement,
provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect
of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select
or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded
to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any Second
Lien Liabilities will be released or disposed of, or any security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will
be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) each Second Lien Agent has approved the release; or


-----

(b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(ii) all claims of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to
performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group
(if any) all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of
the Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such
sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates) and all security under
the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale,
provided that if each of the Senior Facility Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee and any
Senior Creditor Representative (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if any
such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its Affiliates
and not released and discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security
Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser
or one of its affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled
to participate; or

(B) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion
in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection
therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant
circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability
of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of
such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no
obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the first date on which the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt has occurred, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the
guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or
any security over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be
released and/or the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities will
be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

- the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative has approved
the release; or

- where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of the Senior Parent Debt Issuer
are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders
(other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments)

-----

pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not
assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security interests under
the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with
such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good
faith):

such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates
and not released or discharged; and

(II) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security
Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser
or one of its affiliates; and

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled
to participate; or

(II) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion

therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant
circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability
of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of
such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no
obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

**_Application of Proceeds_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that secured parties may only benefit from Recoveries (as defined
below) to the extent that the liabilities of such secured parties has the benefit of the guarantees or
security under which such Recoveries are received and provided that, in all cases, the rights of such

Senior Secured Creditor to obtain the relevant guarantees or security interests.

of Application;”

(ii) in accordance with paragraph (ii) of the section captioned “—Application of Proceeds—Order
of Application;”

(iii) in accordance with paragraphs (iv) to (vi) of the section captioned “—Application of
Proceeds—Order of Application,” provided that payments will be made on a pro rata basis and
pari passu between each of the payments referred to in paragraphs (iv) and (to the extent relating
to Liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where
the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower) (v);

(iv) if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any Secured Debt
Document, in payment to any person to whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority
to any Debtor; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors_**

If, for any reason, any Senior Creditor Liabilities, Senior Notes Liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the
resulting losses are not borne by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility
Lenders in the proportions which their respective exposures at the relevant enforcement date bore to the
aggregate exposures of all the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders at
the enforcement date (or, in the case of Recoveries resulting from the realization or enforcement of all
or any part of the security or a transaction in lieu thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of priority
contemplated in under the section “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”), the relevant
Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders will make such payments among


-----

themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses
are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the order of priority
contemplated under the section “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”).

**_Turnover of Enforcement Proceeds_**

If:

(b) Security Agent or the relevant Agent is not entitled, for reasons of applicable law, to pay
amounts received pursuant to the making of a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss or the enforcement of the security to the Senior Secured Creditors and
the Operating Facility Lenders but is entitled to distribute those amounts to Creditors (such
Creditors, the “Receiving Creditors”) who, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, are subordinated in right and priority of payment to the Senior Secured Creditors
and the Operating Facility Lenders; and

(c) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date has not yet occurred (nor would occur after taking into
account such payments), then the Receiving Creditors shall make such payments to the Senior
Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders as the Security Agent shall require to
place the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the position they
would have been in had such amounts been available for application against the Senior
Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities, provided this shall not apply to any receipt or
recovery that has been distributed by:

(i) a Senior Notes Trustee to the Senior Noteholders in accordance with the Senior Notes
Finance Documents;

(ii) a Senior Parent Notes Trustee to the Senior Parent Noteholders in accordance with the
Senior Parent;

(iii) a Senior Creditor Representative to the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors in
accordance with the Permitted Senior Financing Documents;

(iv) a Second Lien Creditor Representative to the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditors in accordance with the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents; or

(v) a Senior Parent Creditor Representative to the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors in
accordance with the Permitted Parent Financing Documents, unless the Senior Notes
Trustee, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, the Senior Creditor Representative, the
Second Lien Creditor Representative or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as
applicable) had received at least two Business Days’ prior written notice (in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) that an acceleration event or an insolvency event in
relation to a Debtor had occurred or that the receipt or recovery falls within the
provisions set out under the caption “—Turnover” prior to distribution of the relevant
amount.

**_Group Pushdown_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, generally, provides that on, in contemplation of, or after, a public equity
offering (an “IPO Event”) of any member of the Group (other than (x) a subsidiary of a borrower or
issuer which is restricted from being designated as such by the relevant Debt Financing Agreement and
is not replaced prior to such a public equity offering with another Group entity or (y) a subsidiary of the
Parent) or any of its holding companies (the “IPO Entity”), at the Parent’s option:

(i) the Group shall comprise only the IPO Entity and its restricted subsidiaries from time to time
(subject to the exclusions set out in the definition of Group);


-----

(ii) the IPO Entity shall take on the Parent’s role under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings or other provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement shall apply to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a
Debtor or otherwise);

(iv) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether
in its capacity as a Debtor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term of the
Intercreditor Agreement or a default or an event of default;

(v) each holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from
all obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents (including any
security granted by any such holding company); and

(vi) unless otherwise notified by the Parent:

(A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement and all
obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date
specified by the Parent that person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement
as an investor and shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreement as an investor); and

(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement as an investor, such amendments being a “Group Pushdown.”

In the event that any person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement
as an investor as a consequence of the above paragraph, any term of any debt document which requires
or assumes that any person be an investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Parent must provide written notice to the Security Agent in order to implement a Group Pushdown.
Such a notice may be revoked prior to the IPO Event to which it relates provided that (where requested
by an Instructing Group) any security which was released is reinstated and any investor which was
released from its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement accedes again.

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or
replacement of it and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent to facilitate or reflect any of
the matters contemplated by the preceding paragraph and the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
to promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to
any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any security document) as is
requested in order to complete, implement or facilitate such matters.

**_Required Consents_**

may be amended or waived only with the written consent of:

(viii) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging agreement, that

adversely affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of that Hedge Counterparty and is an
amendment or waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that Hedge Counterparty
under the applicable hedging agreement, as notified by the Parent to the Security Agent at the
time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(ix) if an Operating Facility Lender is providing one or more facility to a Debtor under an Operating
Facility Document, that Operating Facility Lender (in each case only to the extent that the

notified by the Parent to the Security Agent at the time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(x) certain investors (as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(xi) the Parent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment or waiver of any Secured Debt Document that is made
or effected in connection with any Debt Refinancing (see “—Debt Refinancing”), any incurrence of
additional and/or refinancing debt (as referred to in “—Ranking and Priority—Additional and/or
_Refinancing Debt”) or Non-Distressed Disposal (see “—Proceeds of Disposals—Non-Distressed_
_Disposals”) or in connection with any other provision of any Secured Debt Document (provided that_
such amendment or waiver is not expressly prohibited by the terms of any other Secured Debt
Document) shall be binding on all parties to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Parent and the Security
Agent without the consent of any other party, to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in
each case of a minor technical or administrative nature or as otherwise for the benefit of all or any of
the Secured Parties. Any amendment, waiver or consent which relates only to the rights or obligations

Agreement and the Parent.

anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

**Bank Line of Credit in Relation to a Guarantee for UEFA Broadcasting Rights**

In July 2021, Raiffeisen Bank International AG Vienna (“Raiffeisen”) and United Media entered into a

of issuing bank guarantees in relation to the purchase of broadcasting rights for exclusive content,
including UEFA content such as Premier League and La Liga, and the acquisition of other exclusive
content rights (such as sports, series and movies) or other similar content. As security for the repayment
of amounts outstanding under this facility agreement, Adria Midco B.V. issued a corporate guarantee
in favour of Raiffeisen. As of the date of this offering memorandum, United Media issued a bank
guarantee for the benefit of UEFA in the amount of €3,600,000 in relation to broadcasting rights for

**Wind Hellas’ Fiber Assets Financing**

Following completion of the transfer of Wind Hellas’ fiber network business into FiberCo, a newly
established and separate subsidiary of Crystal Almond Midco, on January 3, 2022, FiberCo, as
borrower, will enter into a senior term loan facility providing loans for an aggregate amount of up to


-----

€92 million (the “Capex Facility”) and a revolving credit facility for the issuance of letters of guarantees
and/or letters of credit for an aggregate amount up to €16 million (the “Fiber Assets RCF” and, together
with the Capex Facility, the “Fiber Assets Facility”) with Eurobank S.A. and certain other financial
institutions, as lenders, and Wind Hellas Parent, as third party security provider. Amounts made
available under the Fiber Assets Facility shall not exceed €100 million in aggregate.

The Capex Facility will have an overall term of ten years, with an availability period of five years. It
shall be repaid in equal instalments on June 30 and December 31 of each calendar year starting on the
first repayment date falling no less than six months after the date on which the Capex Facility has been
utilized in full or cancelled, subject to a 40% payment on the maturity date. Subject to certain conditions
precedent to drawdown and utilization, including compliance with certain ratios between total debt and
the number of FttH home passed and/or connected in the relevant periods as well as a total debt to equity
ratio of at least 30%, amounts borrowed under the Capex Facility shall be used to finance (i) capital
expenditures for the development, construction, design, start-up, roll-out, lease-out, operation,
maintenance, conversion, acquisition of any fiber network or parts thereof in Greece, as well as certain
permitted acquisitions, and (iii) transaction costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred therewith. Up
to 50% of the borrowing capacity under the Capex Facility shall be provided through the European
Commission’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (the “RRF”), within the framework of, and subject to
the provisions of, the RRF programme. Some of the conditions to drawdown and utilization of amounts
borrowed under the Capex Facility will cease to apply upon a merger between Wind Hellas and Nova
or the execution of a long term services agreement meeting certain specific terms between Wind Hellas
and Nova.

The Fiber Assets RCF will have an overall term of seven years (subject to a refinancing option of one
year), with an availability period lasting until six months prior to the maturity date. The Fiber Assets
RCF shall be repaid at the end of each interest period (quarterly or semi-annual at the selection of
FiberCo). Subject to certain conditions precedent to drawdown and utilization, amounts borrowed under
the Fiber Assets RCF shall be used for the issuance of letters of guarantees and/or letters of credit. In
addition, an ancillary facility may be made available in the form of a letter or credit or letter of
guarantee. Amounts available under such ancillary facility shall reduce the available commitments
under the Fiber Assets RCF.

The Capex Facility and the Fiber Assets RCF will be secured on a pari passu basis on certain assets of
FiberCo. The Fiber Assets Facility will bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR (floored at
zero) plus an applicable margin, which will decrease following the first repayment date and may
decrease if and as long as the Capex Facility is eligible for assignment to the European Central Bank,
subject to certain conditions.

The Fiber Assets Facility will be subject to compliance with a financial covenant applicable after the
end of the available period comprising the (i) ratio of total debt to pro forma consolidated EBITDA,
which cannot exceed the thresholds determined in the Fiber Assets Facility for each quarter, and (ii)
ratio of pro forma consolidated cash flow available for debt service to finance charges and scheduled
repayment of principal amount of secured debt, which should not be less than 1.05x in any period up to
the maturity date with respect to the Capex Facility.

The Fiber Assets Facility will include customary representations and warranties, information covenants,
undertakings and similar provisions. The Fiber Assets Facility will also contain certain EBITDA grower
baskets and is subject to customary events of defaults, including in relation to certain breaches of
obligations under the master service agreement implemented by and between Wind Hellas and FiberCo.
Certain fees and expenses will be payable by FiberCo to the lenders and the agent under the Fiber Assets
Facility, including fees for the provision of services rendered in connection with the financing of Wind
Hellas’ fiber roll-out. A commitment fee will also be payable on the aggregate undrawn amount of the
Fiber Assets Facility during its availability period. For a description of the Wind Hellas’ fiber assets
separation, please refer to “Wind Hellas’ Business—Network and facilities—Fiber Asset Separation.”

**Brief Description of the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance:

- be senior obligations of the Issuer, secured by the Collateral described below under “—
_Security” on a first-priority basis (subject to certain exceptions) along with obligations under_
the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
(although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will, and certain future hedging agreements and certain other indebtedness that is
secured by the Collateral may, receive priority over the Senior Secured Notes with respect to
any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral);

- be senior in right of payment to any indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

**_The SSN Guarantees_**

The SSN Guarantees will, upon issuance:


-----

- be the senior obligations of the relevant Guarantor, which will be secured by the Collateral
described below under “—Security for the Senior Secured Notes” on a first-priority basis
(subject to certain exceptions) along with obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes
and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (although any liabilities in respect of
obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will, and certain future
hedging agreements and other indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral may, receive

action over the Collateral);

- be senior in right of payment to any indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to its SSN Guarantee;

are secured by property or assets that do not secure its SSN Guarantee to the extent of the value
of the property and assets securing such obligations;

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the
relevant Guarantor that do not Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes;

- be subject to limitations described herein, in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_SSN Guarantees and the Security Interests” and in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the New_
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each SSN Guarantee and security interest will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries (including the Issuer) will be Restricted
Subsidiaries, and as of the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, will include the Target Group, except
that one or more entities of the Target Group, including entities holding the Wind Hellas fiber assets as
well as other entities that had previously been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries by Wind Hellas
are expected to be designated as one or more Unrestricted Subsidiaries as of the Wind Hellas
Acquisition Closing Date. See “Summary—The Transactions—The Wind Hellas Acquisition.” In the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Company
will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the covenants in the SSN Indenture.

As of September 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, on a consolidated basis,
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would have had €4,664 million of outstanding
indebtedness, €4,580 million of which is represented by the Senior Secured Notes and the Existing
Senior Secured Notes. See “Capitalization.”

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue €980 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes on the Issue
Date, comprising €580 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate SSNs and €400 million in
aggregate principal amount of FRNs. The Fixed Rate SSNs will mature on, 2030. The FRNs will
mature on, 2029. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.


-----

**Interest**

**_Fixed Rate SSNs_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate SSNs will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Fixed
Rate SSNs will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each and, commencing on,
2022. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record of the Fixed Rate SSNs on
the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on the Fixed Rate SSNs will accrue from the date of
original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest
on the Fixed Rate SSNs will be computed on the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day
months.

**_FRNs_**

Interest on the FRNs will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal outstanding on the
FRNs (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus %, as determined by an
agent appointed by the Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the SSN Indenture (the
“Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be Elavon Financial Services DAC.

Interest on the FRNs will be payable quarterly in arrears on each,, and of
each year, commencing on, 2022. If the due date for any payment in respect of any FRNs is not
a Business Day or a business day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder
thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day or
business day at such place, as the case may be, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay. If a regular record date is not a Business Day, the record date
shall not be affected. The Issuer will pay interest to the Holders of record of the FRNs on the Business
Day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. The FRNs will bear interest from the
Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination
Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the
FRNs in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be
calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the FRNs outstanding at the
commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in
the Interest Period concerned divided by 365; provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of
FRNs outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest
one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being
rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All
euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with
one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest
Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be
binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any
liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made, or intended to be made, by
the Calculation Agent.

If the Issuer determines that the EURIBOR rate is no longer being calculated or administered, or it
becomes illegal for the Calculation Agent to determine any amounts due to be paid, as at the relevant
Determination Date, any alternative rate which has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for
the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as
identified by the Issuer, in consultation with an Independent Financial Advisor appointed by the Issuer,
and promptly thereafter notified by the Issuer to the Holders and the Calculation Agent, the Paying
Agent and the Trustee shall be the new rate replacing EURIBOR (the “EURIBOR Successor Rate”);
_provided, however, that if the Independent Financial Advisor determines that there is no clear market_
consensus as to whether any rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage, the Independent


-----

Financial Advisor shall determine an appropriate alternative rate, and the decision of the Independent
Financial Advisor will be binding on the Issuer, the Calculation Agent and the Holders, and the Issuer
shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the
Paying Agent, at least ten Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such EURIBOR Successor
Rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any
kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate.
Holders shall be bound by any such EURIBOR Successor Rate without any further action or consent
by the Holders of the Trustee; provided, further, that any such alternative rate adopted pursuant to this
paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0.00%. Following the adoption of an alternative rate
pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the SSN Indenture shall be deemed
(provided that the EURIBOR Successor Rate does not, without the prior agreement of the Trustee, the
Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, have the effect of increasing the obligations or
duties, or decreasing the rights or protections, of the Trustee, Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent
under the SSN Indenture) to refer to such alternative rate.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the Holder of any FRNs, provide the interest
rate then in effect with respect to the FRNs. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the FRNs to
receive payments on such FRNs are subject to applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System.

Interest on the FRNs will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days
elapsed. The Applicable Rate on the FRNs will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted
by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the SSN Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the FRNs:

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except (x) in respect of the first Interest
Period, for which the Determination Date will be the Issue Date and (y) in the event that EURIBOR is
not available for any Interest Period (or portion thereof) as may be required to calculate the interest
payable in order to redeem any or all FRNs in respect of any notice of redemption delivered in
accordance with the provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to use
the Determination Date for the prior Interest Period (as notified by the Issuer to the Trustee, Paying
Agent Calculation Agent and the Holders in such redemption notice); provided that if the redemption
date is delayed requiring the Issuer to update the notice of redemption, the Issuer will also reset the
Determination Date in accordance with this definition.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum)
for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR1 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels
time, on the Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If
Reuters Page EURIBOR1 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the
Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the eurozone inter-bank
market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage
per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks
in the eurozone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a three-month
period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at
least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic
mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each
of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for
loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two
such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If


-----

fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect
with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

“eurozone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” in respect of the FRNs means the period commencing on and including an interest
payment date and ending on but excluding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception
that the first Interest Period in respect of the FRNs shall commence on and include the Issue Date and
end on and exclude, 2022.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (a) €1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative
for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR1” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or if no such page is available, Bloomberg page “EBF” or such
other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the
information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes**

The SSN Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €580 million in aggregate
principal amount of Fixed Rate SSNs and €400 million in aggregate principal amount of FRNs will be
issued in this Offering. From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the SSN Indenture
(including the covenants described under the headings “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”), the Issuer will be permitted to issue_
an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes and additional senior secured notes
of other series (any such notes, “Additional Senior Secured Notes”) under the SSN Indenture, which
shall have terms substantially identical to the Senior Secured Notes or another series of senior secured
notes issued under the SSN Indenture (as applicable), except in respect of any of the following terms
which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee (copying the Paying Agent),
or at the election of the Issuer, a supplemental indenture:

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Secured Notes
shall bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of
determining such interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue,
the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such
dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of Holders thereof to whom
such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be denominated
and the currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such Additional
Senior Secured Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole
or in part;


-----

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof,
the denominations in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued and
redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes (and any Additional Senior Secured Notes subsequently issued under the
SSN Indenture), and any other additional notes of another series issued under the SSN Indenture will
be treated as a single class for all purposes under the SSN Indenture, including, without limitation,
waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the SSN
Indenture; provided that unless such Additional Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, are issued with a
separate identification number, such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be fungible with the relevant
series of Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references to the “Senior Secured Notes” for all purposes of the SSN Indenture and this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” include references to any Additional Senior Secured Notes
and any other series of senior secured notes that are issued under the SSN Indenture and book-entry
interests therein.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, on the Global
Senior Secured Notes will be payable through one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Relevant Clearing System, which will credit the account specified
by the Holder (being the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one
or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by the Paying Agent by wire transfer to
the Holders entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive Registered Senior
Secured Notes. See “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes.”

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Senior Secured
Notes for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent will
be Elavon Financial Services DAC.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”).
The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be
Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent, as applicable, will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes outstanding
from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes
without prior notice to the Holders. The Issuer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as
Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially be issued as follows:

- Fixed Rate SSNs sold to U.S. persons and within the United States, in each case, to qualified
institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented


-----

by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A
Global Fixed Rate Notes”) and FRNs sold to U.S. persons and within the United States, in each
case, to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “144A Global Floating Rates Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Fixed
Rate Notes, the “144A Global Senior Secured Notes”).

- The 144A Global Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with, and registered
in the name of the nominee for, the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream.

- Fixed Rate SSNs sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Fixed Rate Notes”) and FRNs
sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the
Regulation S Global Floating Rate Notes, the “Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes” and,
together with the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes, the “Global Senior Secured Notes”).

- The Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with, and
registered in the name of the nominee for, the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through
such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be
subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described
more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes
only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the SSN
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Senior Secured Note representing the Fixed Rate SSNs (the
“Fixed Rate Global Senior Secured Notes”), and no Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Fixed Rate Global Senior Secured Notes (the “Fixed Rate
Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes”), may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry
Interest in any Global Senior Secured Note representing the FRNs (the “Floating Rate Global Senior
Secured Notes”) or any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest in the Floating Rate Global Senior Secured Notes (the “Floating Rate Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes”), and no Book-Entry Interest in the Floating Rate Global Senior Secured Notes
and no Floating Rate Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note may be transferred or exchanged for
any Book-Entry Interest in any Fixed Rate Global Senior Secured Note or any Fixed Rate Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Note.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, ownership of Book-Entry
Interests in Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any
sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such


-----

resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing,
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the SSN Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note from which it was
transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note to which it was
transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions,
if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Secured Note to
which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum
denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and
other documentation required by the SSN Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based
upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the SSN Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the SSN Indenture will require the
transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental
charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in
connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15-days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15-days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Definitive
Registered Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed in part; or

(3) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer (each, as defined herein).

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat
the Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**SSN Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior secured basis, (i) on the Issue Date, by the


-----

Company, (ii) within 120 days following (and not including) the Issue Date, by the Existing Subsidiary
Guarantors and (iii) within 180 days (and not including) following the Issue Date, by the Wind Hellas
Guarantor (such guarantee, or any other Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes provided from time to
time, a “SSN Guarantee”).

The Guarantors and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation are as follows:

Adria Midco B.V ................................................................................... Netherlands

Adria Serbia Holdco B.V ....................................................................... Netherlands

Adria Cable B.V ..................................................................................... Netherlands

Adria Media B.V .................................................................................... Netherlands

Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l. .................................................................... Luxembourg

Bosnia Broadband S.à r.l........................................................................ Luxembourg

Telemach d.o.o ....................................................................................... Slovenia

Telemach UG d.o.o ................................................................................ Slovenia

Telemach BH d.o.o. Sarajevo ................................................................ Bosnia and Herzegovina

United Group Bulgaria EOOD ............................................................... Bulgaria

Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD .............................................................. Bulgaria

Bulgarian Telecommunications Company EAD .................................... Bulgaria

Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. ................................................ Greece

Each SSN Guarantee will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles, which include restrictions on
the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, foreign-exchange controls and similar
matters. Each SSN Guarantee will also be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law. By virtue of these limitation,
a Guarantor’s obligation under its SSN Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its SSN
Guarantee. In particular, the SSN Guarantee granted by the Wind Hellas Guarantor will be limited to
the proceeds of Bridge Facilities that have been used for the Wind Hellas Indebtedness Refinancing
with certain Greek law limitations, in each case, as described in “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security Interests.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—Each SSN Guarantee and security_
_interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “—Our subsidiaries_
_located in Serbia, as well as other subsidiaries representing a significant portion of our revenue and_
_EBITDA, will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, and each of the SSN Guarantees will be_
_structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-guarantor_
_subsidiaries.”_

The SSN Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

- except in the case of the SSN Guarantee by the Company, upon a sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of ownership
interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does
not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such
sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the SSN Indenture, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein);

- except in the case of the SSN Guarantee by the Company, upon the designation in accordance
with the SSN Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;


-----

- upon defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- except in the case of the SSN Guarantee by the Company, with respect to a Guarantor that is
not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to
the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability
with respect to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and (ii) is not Guaranteeing
any other Credit Facility or Public Debt of the Company or another Guarantor at the time;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- as described under the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness”;_

- with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction not prohibited by “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors” and the SSN Indenture; or_

- with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor
pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer,
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary.

Substantially all the operations of the Company and the Issuer are conducted through their Subsidiaries.
Claims of creditors of Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors
and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and
minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries, generally will have priority with respect to the
assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
including the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each SSN Guarantee therefore will be effectively
subordinated to creditors (including trade and secured creditors) and preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company. For the nine months ended and as of September
30, 2021, (i) the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding the Target Group) generated 44% of the
Company’s consolidated revenue and 59% of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, (ii) the
Company’s Subsidiaries (including the Issuer and the other Guarantors, but excluding the Target Group)
had a net loss of €34 million, compared to a consolidated net loss of €61 million for the Company and
(iii) the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 43% of the Company’s consolidated total assets
(excluding goodwill). Within 180 days following (and not including) the Issue Date, the Wind Hellas
Guarantor is expected to accede to the SSN Indenture as Guarantor. For the nine months ended and as
of September 30, 2021, the Wind Hellas Guarantor comprised substantially all of the WH EBITDA and
gross assets of Wind Hellas. However, the SSN Guarantee granted by Wind Hellas Guarantor is
expected to be limited to the amount of the proceeds from the Bridge Facilities that are provided to
Wind Hellas in connection with the Wind Hellas Indebtedness Refinancing, in addition to other
limitations under applicable law. See “Use of Proceeds.”

The Company’s subsidiaries organized in Serbia, North Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Malta,
Cyprus, Switzerland and Canada, and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries organized in Slovenia,
Bulgaria and Greece, will not guarantee the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Although the
SSN Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of
Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
SSN Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities
that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the SSN Indenture.
See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have granted or (as applicable) will
grant in favor of the Security Agents liens and security interests, subject to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, over certain of
their assets, as listed below:

On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer and the Company, as applicable, have granted or (as applicable)
will grant security over, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection
requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens:

- shares of the Issuer, Adria Serbia Holdco B.V. and Adria Cable B.V.;

- certain bank accounts of the Issuer and the Company; and

- certain receivables owing to the Issuer (collectively, the “Initial Collateral”).

In addition, pursuant to Security Documents to be entered into within 120 days following (and not
including) the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees are expected to be secured
by the following assets, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection
requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens:

- shares of Adria Media B.V., Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l., Bosnia Broadband S.à r.l., Telemach
d.o.o., Telemach UG d.o.o. and Telemach BH d.o.o. Sarajevo;

- shares or ownership stakes of Serbia Broadband—Srpske Kablovske Mreže d.o.o. Beograd
(Voždovac) owned by Adria Serbia Holdco B.V.;

- certain bank accounts of Adria Serbia Holdco B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria Media B.V.,
Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l., Bosnia Broadband S.à r.l. and Telemach BH d.o.o. Sarajevo;

- blank signed bills of exchange and bills of exchange authorizations issued by Telemach d.o.o.
and Telemach UG d.o.o.; and

- certain receivables owing to Adria Cable B.V., Slovenia Broadband S.à r.l., Bosnia Broadband
S.à r.l. and Telemach d.o.o. in respect of intercompany loans (collectively, the “Post-Closing
Collateral”); and

- the shares of each of United Group Bulgaria EOOD, Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD and
Bulgarian Telecommunications S.A., subject, in each case, to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens (the
“Vivacom Collateral” and, together with the Initial Collateral, the Post-Closing Collateral and
any and all other assets from time to time in which a security interest has been or will be granted
pursuant to any Security Document to secure obligations under the SSN Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes, the “Collateral”).

For a summary of the Agreed Security Principles, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

The Collateral granted in relation to the Senior Secured Notes also secures or will secure the liabilities
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes and
may secure Operating Facilities and Hedging Agreements and other indebtedness (including any
Additional Senior Secured Notes and any other series of senior secured notes issued under the SSN
Indenture). Pursuant to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain Operating Facilities and certain


-----

Hedging Obligations permitted to be incurred under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and permitted to be secured on the Collateral on a super priority basis (see “—Certain_
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”) will receive priority over the Holders with respect to any_
proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral. Subject to certain conditions,
including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest,” the Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future_
issuances of its Indebtedness (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes) or Indebtedness of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, as not prohibited under the SSN Indenture and
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral,
after all liabilities in respect of obligations under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
certain Operating Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations have been discharged from such
recoveries, will be applied pro rata in payment of all liabilities in respect of obligations under the SSN
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes and any other Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the SSN Indenture and
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (including the Existing Senior Secured Notes).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the_
Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its
Indebtedness, including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, or Indebtedness of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, as permitted under the SSN Indenture.

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case
pursuant to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, for the benefit of all holders of the Issuer’s obligations
secured by such Collateral. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence
governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement will
provide for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel
debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Netherlands.
The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN
_Guarantees and the Collateral—Each SSN Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the SSN_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.” For a description of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, see_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia,
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. The Liens on the Collateral, and the ability of the
Security Agent to realize upon the Collateral, will be limited as necessary to recognize certain
limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of
Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance, foreign-exchange controls or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Security Interests.” In addition, the enforcement of the_
Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the
enforceable amount of the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and a Guarantor’s
obligation under its SSN Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the SSN
Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the
_Collateral—Each SSN Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on_


-----

_enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity and enforceability.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Collateral
provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate
the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the_
pledgors of the Collateral will be permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances
of Indebtedness of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Senior Secured
Notes, not prohibited by the SSN Indenture.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection
with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the
sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the SSN Indenture and the Security Documents
following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders and
the obligations owed under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior
Secured Notes, any Operating Facilities and any Hedging Obligations. By its nature, some or all of the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. In addition, the
Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional
Senior Secured Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the
SSN Indenture. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured
_Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the_
_extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and_
_future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Senior Secured_
_Notes; in the event that the Collateral is enforced, the lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit_
_Facility, counterparties of certain hedging obligations and creditors for other super priority_
_indebtedness will be paid with the proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral in priority to the holders_
_of the Senior Secured Notes.”_

In addition, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will place limitations on
the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some or all of the Collateral. These limitations may
include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions
or only at a price confirmed by a valuation in certain circumstances. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes has, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder
will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without
limitation, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights,
powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security
Documents), together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute
each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be
executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and


-----

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The SSN Indenture will provide that the Security Documents may be enforced only upon an acceleration
of the amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes following an Event of Default. The SSN Indenture
will also provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the
right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee, the Holders and any other secured
parties. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the
Trustee under the SSN Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents) provide instructions to the Security
Agent in respect of the Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders may, individually or collectively,
take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Trustee
and the Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Trustee and the Security Agent will agree
to any release of the security interests created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the
SSN Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders.

The SSN Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture, as applicable,
will be secured by security interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes and the SSN Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Release of Liens.”

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only to the extent required or necessary) will take any action
required to effectuate any release of Collateral required by a Security Document:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes issued under the SSN Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance
with the SSN Indenture;

(2) upon release of a SSN Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such SSN Guarantee
granted by such Guarantor) in accordance with the SSN Indenture;

(3) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any
Person other than the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the
_Company”) that is not prohibited by the SSN Indenture (with respect to the Lien on such_
Collateral) or (b) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consistent with the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee or Security Agent, if the Lien granted in favor
of the Credit Facility, Public Debt or such other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance
with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(7) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection
with a solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of


-----

the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the SSN Indenture (including in accordance with “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”), the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or_
the relevant Security Documents.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary,
the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders.

The Issuer, the Company, the other Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may also,
among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct
ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the
Lien under the Security Documents which has become worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or
useful in the business; (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets in the ordinary
course of business; and (iii) any other action permitted by the Security Documents or the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the
request of the Company or the Issuer, enter into with the Company or the Issuer (as applicable), the
relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
representatives) one or more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement,
amendment or other modification of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor
Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are
not materially less favorable to the Holders) and substantially similar as applies to sharing of the
proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security; provided that such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the
Trustee or the Security Agent under the SSN Indenture or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company or the Issuer (as applicable) shall furnish to the Trustee
such documentation in relation thereto as it may reasonably require. As used herein, a reference to the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the Holders
to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments.”_

The SSN Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent
of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1)
cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount
or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is
Incurred in compliance with the SSN Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to
such agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured
Notes), (5) make provision to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens in accordance with the terms
of the SSN Indenture or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect
the Holders in any material respect.


-----

The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Existing Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms
of such Existing Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may
only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment
does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under
the SSN Indenture or Existing Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The SSN Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be
deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and
to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into the Existing Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the Company or the Issuer
shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a
“Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the SSN Indenture and the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date
specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that: (i) references to the Company and
Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity
and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same
entity; (ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at
the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity (or the Issuer, if so elected); (iii) each reference in the
SSN Indenture and/or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) to the “Company” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity
(to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise, and provided further that
nothing in this paragraph (1), including the deeming construct contemplated by this subparagraph (iii) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be
the Company or the Issuer, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result
in a breach of any covenant or other term in the SSN Indenture or a Default or an Event of
Default); (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of
Default in the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO
Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no
event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the SSN Indenture or
a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall
be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the SSN Indenture, the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security
granted by any such holding company; (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Company or the
Issuer: (A) each person which is party to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
and all obligations and restrictions under the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) (and from the date specified by the Company or the Issuer
that person shall cease to be party to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and shall have no further rights or obligations under
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party


-----

to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor; and (viii) in the event that any person is released from or does not become party to the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor as
a consequence of this paragraph (1), any term of the SSN Indenture and/or the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or
assumes that any person be an Investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be
subject to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or
otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event
of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this provision).

(2) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the SSN
Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents required by the Company or
the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Company or the Issuer in order to
facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (1) above; provided that such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent (as applicable), does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of
the Trustee or the Security Agent (as applicable) under such amendment, replacement or other
document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized
and instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such
amended or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and
shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Company or the Issuer).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary
of the Company notified to the Trustee by the Company or the Issuer in writing as the person
to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant Initial Public Offering,
provided that: (i) the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary which will issue
shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that Initial Public Offering (or a holding
company of such Restricted Subsidiary); and (ii) the Company or the Issuer may not designate
a Subsidiary of the Issuer as the IPO Pushdown Entity.

(4) If the Company or the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and Security Agent
pursuant to paragraph (1) above in relation to a contemplated Initial Public Offering, it shall be
entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant
Initial Public Offering by written notice to the Trustee and Security Agent. In the event that any
Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph (4): (i) the provisions of subparagraphs (1)(i) to (1)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii)
if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (1) above in reliance on that Pushdown
Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company or the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security
Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any person party to the Existing Intercreditor
Agreement as an “Investor” has been released from the Existing Intercreditor Agreement
pursuant to sub-paragraph (1)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, and the Trustee
has received notice of such “Investor” released parties, the Trustee shall request by prior written
notice to the Company or the Issuer and that person, that person shall as soon as reasonably
practicable accede to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this paragraph (4) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the
Company or the Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or
contemplated Initial Public Offering; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not
be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term in the SSN Indenture or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any


-----

action or step taken by any person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that
Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Optional Redemption**

series as the Fixed Rate SSNs); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate SSNs (excluding
the principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under the SSN Indenture

_FRNs_


-----

At any time prior to, 2023, the Issuer may redeem the FRNs, in whole or in part, at its option,
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100.000% of
the principal amount of such FRNs plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest

interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the FRNs redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Any
redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness or a Change
of Control) as set out in the notice of redemption. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed;
_provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days_
prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such
notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Company, its Subsidiaries (including the Issuer) and its and their Affiliates may repurchase Senior
Secured Notes at any time and from time to time. Any such purchases may be made through open
market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or
exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as
the Company, its Subsidiaries (including the Issuer) and its and their Affiliates may determine.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any class of the Senior Secured
Notes, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of at least 90% of
the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such class validly tender
and do not withdraw their Senior Secured Notes and the Issuer (or any other person making such tender
offer) purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such class validly tendered and not withdrawn, the
Issuer (or such other person making such tender offer), within 30 days of such purchase, may redeem
all (but not less than all) of the Senior Secured Notes of that class that remain outstanding following
such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to any other holders in such tender offer (other than any
early tender premium, incentive payment or similar payment), plus, to the extent not included in the
purchase price, accrued and unpaid interest. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such class have validly
tendered and not withdrawn such Senior Secured Notes, Senior Secured Notes owned by an Affiliate
of the Company or by funds controlled, managed or advised by any Affiliate of the Company, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been tendered for the purposes of such
tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes prior to their maturity date.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of a class of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments


-----

to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required
by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements; provided that no Senior Secured Note
of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured
Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Registrar or any other agent will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but
not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at the address
of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the SSN Indenture.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and
to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice
to the Holders and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change
in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case
of a Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note, a new Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note
redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note. In the case of a Global Senior Secured Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an
amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on Senior Secured Notes
or portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem a class of Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon
giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable)
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption
Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer or a Guarantor determines in good
faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings
(including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction,

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined in “—Withholding Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts (as defined in “—Withholding
_Taxes”) with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking_
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of


-----

a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable but not including assignment of the obligation to
make payment with respect to the Senior Secured Notes). In the case of redemption due to withholding
or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(as defined in “—Withholding Taxes”) at the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax
Law must become effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption
due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law
must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,
unless the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of a Successor Company (as
defined herein) or the predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be delivered in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make
such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes were then
due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts
remains in effect. Prior to the delivery or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or a Guarantor or a successor to either, where applicable,
will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer or a
Guarantor or a successor to either, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting
forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been
satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the
Issuer or a Guarantor or a successor to either, where applicable, has or have been or will become
obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply _mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any_
jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered
to be a resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor makes any
payment on the Senior Secured Notes or any SSN Guarantees, and any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination,
defeasance or discharge of the SSN Indenture.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor or any successor entity to either (a “Payor”) in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any SSN Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding
or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account
of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the Netherlands or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein
having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made by
the Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for
tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of
clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),


-----

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by a Payor or the Paying Agent
with respect to any Senior Secured Note or SSN Guarantee, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including
any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which
would have been received by such Holder in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note
or SSN Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed
present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior
Secured Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of,
or possessor of power over, the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident
for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from
the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment
in respect thereof;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to
the Holder or beneficial owner after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be made) to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar
claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by
a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but only to the extent the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any SSN Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, value added, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar
tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future
regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section
1471(b) of the Code and any intergovernmental agreements (and related legislation or official
administrative guidance) implemented with respect to the foregoing;

(6) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021); or_

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without
such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Secured Note
for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant
payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of
the Senior Secured Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.


-----

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Notes,
to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership
or the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Notes would not have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes
directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with
applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor and will provide such certified copies, or if,
notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such certified copies are not
available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Trustee. Such certified copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on
any Senior Secured Note or any SSN Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee (copying the Paying Agent) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact
that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant
payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the
relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as
practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent
will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever in either the SSN Indenture or this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” there are
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes, such reference
shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other property or
similar taxes, charges or levies that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration or enforcement of any Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Indenture, the Security Documents
or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a
transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes) and the Issuer agrees to indemnify the Holders for
any such Taxes paid by such Holders.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the SSN Indenture
and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is organized or
any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.


-----

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the
Issuer to repurchase all of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes (in denominations equal to € 100,000
aggregate principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior
Secured Notes of €100,000 or less may only be purchased in whole and not in part) at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase; provided, however, that
the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Secured Notes as described under this “Change
_of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem_
all of the Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice
(the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the
Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right
to require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to
the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest
payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) and record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the SSN Indenture, that a
Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change
of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in
the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Senior Secured Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying
Agent the Global Senior Secured Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior
Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and


-----

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes accepted for
purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly
wire to each Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes so tendered the Change of Control
Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be
authenticated) and mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes a new Senior
Secured Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate
principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and
to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change
of Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the SSN Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s
right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to consummate a transaction (including the
acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) that would constitute
a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth under this “—Change of Control” section applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the
consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change
of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured
Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this
covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules)
conflict with provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require
a repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the SSN Indenture
by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer may rely on any no action letters issued by the SEC indicating that
the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain
conditions.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. For example, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following
the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources.
Under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control of the
Company would require the repayment of such debt, and under the Existing Indentures and the PIK
Indenture, the occurrence of a change of control of the Company would require the Issuer to make an
offer to purchase the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the PIK Notes. As a result, there can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required repurchase of the
Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the PIK Notes. In addition, certain events
that may constitute a change of control under other indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreements may not constitute a Change


-----

of Control under the SSN Indenture. Certain indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries may
prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Senior Secured Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide
that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the
exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes could
cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does
not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not have the ability to raise the_
_funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a_
_change of control as required by the SSN Indenture and the change of control provision contained in_
_the SSN Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate_
_events. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all_
_outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_
_tender.”_

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control under the SSN Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Issuer’s
ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such_
restrictions in the SSN Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in
such covenants, however, the SSN Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may
afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Specified Change of Control Event feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers
and the Issuer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and the decision whether to
make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above will in such circumstance be
made in the good faith judgment of the Issuer.

The provisions of the SSN Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written
consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Company and any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such
Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds
thereof), the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Company is less than 6.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:


-----

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit
Facility (including letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any Credit
Facility), and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a maximum aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of (a) €970 million
and (b) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any

Incurrence of such Indebtedness is not prohibited under the terms of the SSN Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness
of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that:_

is not a Guarantor or the Issuer, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of
payment to prior payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration
or otherwise) and the performance in full of its obligations under the SSN Indenture to
the extent required by the Existing Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results
in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness
to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in
each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior
Secured Notes) and the SSN Guarantees, and the Existing Senior Secured Notes and related

the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and
the application of the proceeds therefrom, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of
any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant and (d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (i) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or another Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated,

Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to each of clause (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that
at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (a) either the Company would have been


-----

able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
or the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company would not be greater than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction, in either case after
giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5);

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company);

(7) Indebtedness represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations,

time outstanding the greater of €73 million and 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA;

with past practice, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar
instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice; provided, however, that upon the drawing

business or consistent with past practice and (d) any customary cash management, cash pooling
or netting or setting off arrangements in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice;

disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than
Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or
assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided
that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such
Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market value of noncash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent
changes in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
connection with such disposition;

(10)

(a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion,
will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be
required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second
paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) [Reserved];

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;


-----

are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause
(1), (7), (11) or (14) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness shall be calculated as described under the definition of
“Indebtedness”;

(8) if at any time the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have Incurred any
then outstanding item of Indebtedness originally incurred under clauses (1), (7), (11) and (14)
of the second paragraph of this covenant pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, such
item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(9) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a
“cash sweep” or “clean down” provision or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that
provide that Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for
the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first
Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or
commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (25) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the
Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the SSN Indenture, including without
limitation for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, or usage of clauses (1) through (15) of the second paragraph
of this covenant (if any) for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance
and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option,
either be determined (a) on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or
increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such
date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such Consolidated
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other
provision of the SSN Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or
reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or other provision of the
SSN Indenture at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters
of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed
or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on
a date pursuant to the operation of this sub-clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1)
through (15) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred
and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any


-----

such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Issuer may revoke such
determination at any time and from time to time; and

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at
the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction
shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus
premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, defeasance, costs and fees
in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first
committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if
such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than
euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such eurodenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal
amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued
and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro
Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on, in the case of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Issue Date, or in the case of the Target Group, the
Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the Issue Date or the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, as applicable; and (c) if and
for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency
in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the
amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment
required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such
amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not
covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for the benefit of its employees
to the extent funded by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to January 1, 2019 of any

any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted
Subsidiaries (valued, in each case, as provided in the definition of
“Investment”) not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted
Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under this clause (iv), was
included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments
referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c); provided, however,
that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for


-----

purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the
Company’s or Issuer’s option) included under this clause (iv); and

of this clause (c).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would
otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to
sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts
result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities received in
contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control
pursuant to the definition thereof were it not a Specified Change of Control Event, (2) the purpose of
the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified
Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash
Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in
connection with such event in accordance with the requirements of the SSN Indenture.

Upon the occurrence of any Specified Change of Control Event following the Issue Date, all amounts

Company; _provided, however, that to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair_
market value of property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of Capital Stock,
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of
the first paragraph of this covenant;

the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above, and that in each case,
constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;

provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series
of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary

Restricted Subsidiary from any future, present or former Management Investors of the

an amount not to exceed with respect to such Taxes, unless otherwise required by Dutch tax
rules in respect of a fiscal unity, the amount of any such Taxes that the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries would have been required to pay on a separate company basis or on a
consolidated basis if the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries had paid tax on a
consolidated, combined, group, affiliates or unitary basis on behalf of an affiliate group
consisting only of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that the remainder of
any such distribution to any Parent Holding Company not used for such Taxes shall be returned
to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The
fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of
any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the
Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company acting in good faith.

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment
(or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments
described in clauses (1) through (19) of the fourth paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of
“Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment
(or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on
the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any
manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one or more of the
clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
in a Permitted Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer,
the Company, any Parent Holding Company or any of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to
transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Holding Company and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action
by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest
therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the
“Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1)
Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured
Notes and the SSN Indenture (or a SSN Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured
equally and ratably with (or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness)
such Indebtedness for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured and (b) in the case of any property or
asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens (provided that a Lien to secure Indebtedness


-----

pursuant to clauses (1), (6) or (14) of the second paragraph of the “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
covenant may have priority with respect to the proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral not materially
less favorable to the Holders than that accorded to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
pursuant to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement).

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding
paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release
_of Liens.”_

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase
in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability
of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or the Company;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or the Company; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or the Company,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility or other documents identified
as “Finance Documents” pursuant to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, (b) the
Existing Indentures or the PIK Indenture or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in each case,
in effect at or entered into on, in the case of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the
Issue Date, or in the case of the Target Group, the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating
to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which
such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on
which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred
as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection


-----

with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; _provided that, for the purposes of this_
clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement
or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any (A) encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or
instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial
Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an
agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however,
that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in
any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders
taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or
Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification
relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Company or
an Officer of the Issuer or the Company) and (B) any encumbrance or restriction arising as a
result of a Permitted Tax Restructuring;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the SSN Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the SSN Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions
restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges
or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the SSN Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint
venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property
or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;


-----

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially
less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement,
together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date, (ii) in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or
the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company) or where the Issuer determines when
such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect,
in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior
Secured Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation
_on Liens”; or_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer
or the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value
to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer
or the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person
assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness)
received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of
cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or
is required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) to prepay,
repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility or
any other Credit Facility or the Existing Indentures, the PIK Indenture or the SSN
Indenture (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof), plus accrued and
unpaid interest and any applicable redemption premium to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption, within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of
such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_
_however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption_
of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in


-----

the case of any revolving Indebtedness including, but not limited to, the revolving credit
facility made available under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) to be
permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid,
purchased or redeemed; (ii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu
Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest and any applicable redemption
premium to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; provided
that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary shall redeem, repay or repurchase Pari
Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Issuer
either (A) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes on an
equal or ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Indebtedness redeemed, repaid or
repurchased pursuant to this clause (ii) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Senior Secured
Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” and/or (y) purchasing Senior
Secured Notes through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions
at market prices (which may be below par) and/or (B) makes (at such time or
subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders to purchase
their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness redeemed, repaid or repurchased pursuant to this clause (ii) (which offer
shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for purposes hereof); (iii) to purchase
Senior Secured Notes through open market purchases or in privately negotiated
transactions at market prices (which may be below par); (iv) to make (at such time or
subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders to purchase
their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer
for purposes hereof) or (v) to redeem Senior Secured Notes as described under “—
_Optional Redemption”; or_

(b) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit
to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional
Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that
any such investment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the
Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company that is executed or approved
within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is
consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however,
that any such capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a
commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Company or an
Officer of the Issuer or the Company that is executed or approved within such time will
satisfy this requirement, so long as such capital expenditure is consummated within
180 days of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, (1) pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clauses (a) through (d) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the SSN
Indenture and (2) the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest
in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net Available Cash attributable to any given Asset
Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the
Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset


-----

Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be
applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the
Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Issuer or to a
Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and
statutory duties of the relevant directors), (y) a contribution or distribution of any or all of the Net
Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Issuer or to a Restricted
Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax
consequences, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, or (z) a contribution or distribution of
any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by the Company or a Subsidiary to the
Issuer or to a Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is subject to
a contractual encumbrance or restriction affecting the distribution and such encumbrance or restriction
is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries,” the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be_
applied in compliance with this covenant.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in clause (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the SSN Indenture. On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, or
at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the SSN
Indenture exceeds €30 million and has not been committed in accordance with clause (3)(b) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to
all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any
such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out
of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and, in the case of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, at an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the SSN Indenture or the agreements governing
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes,
subject to the other covenants contained in the SSN Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds,
the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to
be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal
amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by
converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date
selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the
extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are
denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the
net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually
received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into such currency.


-----

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a
period of not less than five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer
Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period
(the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent they elect, Pari Passu
Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer
Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer,
or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn and, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the
Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase
price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and
accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or
amend the Global Senior Secured Note), and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent), upon delivery of
an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred
by book-entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal
to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior
Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000.
Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by bookentry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities (other than contingent
liabilities) of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) or
Indebtedness or other liabilities (other than contingent liabilities) of a Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection
with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary
are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together


-----

with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at
that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €126 million and 2.0% of Total Assets (with
the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at
the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured
Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the SSN
Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules)
conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the SSN
Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”)
involving aggregate value in excess of €20 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained
in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an
Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €30 million,
the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer or the Company.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or

plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent Holding Company, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’
plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement,
savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of
officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer
or the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice
or entered into in connection with or as a result of the Transactions, the United Group
Acquisition Transactions, the Tele2 Transactions, the Vivacom Transactions, the Optima
Telekom Transactions, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility 2021 Increase, the 2020
Financing Transactions, the 2019 OpCo Refinancing Transactions or the 2017 Refinancing
Transactions and any transactions of a similar nature to the foregoing that occur after the Issue
Date;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;


-----

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent
Holding Company; _provided that such Parent Holding Company shall have no material_
liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the
Company and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the
SSN Indenture;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any

the foregoing that occur after the Issue Date and the entry into and performance of obligations
of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising
out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument
in effect as of or on, in the case of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Issue Date,
or in the case of the Target Group, the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, as these
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or

not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect and the entry into and
performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public

Board of Directors of the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than
those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or

Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the

of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Company in their reasonable
determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any

obligations under the terms of, any equityholders’ agreement (including any registration rights
agreement or purchase agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of, in the case of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Issue Date, or in the case of the Target Group,
the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date and any similar agreement that it may enter into
thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after, in the case of the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Issue Date, or in the case of the Target Group, the Wind Hellas
Acquisition Closing Date will only be permitted under this clause to the extent that the terms
of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders
(taken as a whole) in any material respect as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company;

(16) (i) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (and

Subsidiary generally to other non-affiliated third-party investors on the same or more favorable
terms and (ii) payments to Affiliates in respect of securities of the Company or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries contemplated in the foregoing sub-clause (i) or that were acquired from

with the terms of such securities;

(17) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in
connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any

_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or entered into with any Business Successor, in each case,_
that the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the
Company determines in good faith is either fair to the Issuer or the Company or otherwise on
customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions;


-----

Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” and pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted
Subsidiaries;

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the
following reports:

(1) within 120 days following the end of the fiscal year of the Company beginning with the year
ending December 31, 2021, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following
information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the most
recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow
of the Company for the most recent two fiscal years, including customary footnotes to such
financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b)
unaudited _pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the_
Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income
statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year (other than the Optima Telekom
Acquisition and the Wind Hellas Acquisition); (c) an operating and financial review of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies, with a similar scope to that
included in the Offering Memorandum; (d) description of the business, management and
shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material
contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material
risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters of the Company beginning
with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022, quarterly reports of the Company containing the
following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow of
the Company for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date, and the comparable prior-year period of the Company, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited _pro forma income statement information and_
balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available),
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter (other than the
Optima Telekom Acquisition and the Wind Hellas Acquisition); (c) an operating and financial


-----

review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations,
financial condition, and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company,
and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and
contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any
senior executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any
other material event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly,
a report containing a description of such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS
as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then
in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set
forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier
periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided for in this covenant, no report need
include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company. The filing of an Annual
Report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in (1) will satisfy such provision. At the
Company’s election it may include consolidated financial statements of a Parent Holding Company in
lieu of those for the Company; provided that, if the financial statements of a Parent Holding Company
are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the
financial statements of the Parent Holding Company and the Company shall be included for any period
after the Issue Date. Following an Initial Public Offering on the Capital Stock of the Company or any
parent thereof and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements
of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting
requirements of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information
required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company
or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited
reconciliation to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph or in the third paragraph of this covenant, the Company
shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on
such website as may be then maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide
substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company) or (b) to the extent
the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company
determines in good faith that the Company cannot make such reports or statement available in the
manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of the Company’s
commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports or statement to the Holders and, upon request,
prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes. The Company will also make available copies of
all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long
as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Authority so require.

In addition, so long as the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which
the Company or the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt
therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3 2(b), the Company shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request,


-----

prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant
to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for
information purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the
SSN Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer and the Company_

Neither the Issuer nor the Company will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or
lease all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province of Canada, Norway, Switzerland or a Permissible Jurisdiction and the Successor
Company (if not the Issuer or the Company, as the case may be) will expressly assume (in each
case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer
or the Company, as the case may be, under the Senior Secured Notes or the SSN Guarantee and
(b) all obligations of the Issuer or the Company, as the case may be, under the Security
Documents (and, to the extent required by the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;

(3) in the case of a transaction involving the Company, immediately after giving effect to such
transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00
of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” or (b) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Successor Company would not_
be greater than the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company was immediately prior to
giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer complies with the SSN
Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the SSN Indenture relating to such consolidation,
merger or transfer have been satisfied and that the SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes,
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Issuer or the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms.
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate without
independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
(or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as
a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”


-----

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer or the
Company, as the case may be, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer or the Company instead
of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer
or the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Issuer or the Company, as the case may be.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer or the Company, as the case may be, under the SSN Indenture but in the case of a lease of
all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under
such Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—
_Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and, other than_
with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant, (a)
any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part
of its properties and assets to the Issuer or the Company, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other
Restricted Subsidiary and (c) the Issuer, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake
the Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the
transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer or the Company may consolidate or otherwise
combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of the Issuer or the Company, reincorporating the Issuer or the Company in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer or the Company.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict the
Transactions, including the merger or liquidation of the Target or the Wind Hellas Parent after the Wind
Hellas Acquisition Closing Date.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Guarantor that is a Subsidiary of the Issuer (a “Subsidiary Guarantor”) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction;
or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes (in each case subject
to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all


-----

of the obligations of the Guarantor under its SSN Guarantee and the
Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement); and
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has
occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way
of consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition
of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other
than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the SSN Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B) and the provisions described above under “—The Issuer and
_the Company” (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted_
Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties
and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Subsidiary
Guarantor and (c) the Subsidiary Guarantors may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a
Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor
reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the
Subsidiary Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the SSN Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Senior Secured Notes: “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on_
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,”_
“—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Company,” and “—
_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness,” and, in each case, any related default provision_
of the SSN Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of
any effect with regard to actions of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken during
the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute
a Default or Event of Default. The “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted
as if it has been in effect since the date of such Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have
occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made during the continuance of the Suspension
Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension
Event will be classified, at the Company’s or Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses
set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted
to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior
to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would


-----

not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue_
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during the_
continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” and (b) any
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in
clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distribution from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the_
continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

In addition, the SSN Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the
Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions
in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status
as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event. The Trustee
shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify the Holders if the
Senior Secured Notes achieve an Investment Grade Status. The Company shall notify the Trustee that
the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied; provided that no such
notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be
effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable,
upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment
Grade Status.

**_Limited Condition Acquisition, Irrevocable Repayment and Certain Compliance Calculations_**

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or
Irrevocable Repayment, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the SSN
Indenture which requires that no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing
or would result from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Company
or the Issuer, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the
date the Definitive Agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is
entered into after giving pro forma effect to the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company or the Issuer has exercised its option under the
first sentence of this paragraph, and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the date the
Definitive Agreement for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment was
entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable
Repayment, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing
for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited Condition
Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is permitted hereunder.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or
Irrevocable Repayment for purposes of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of the SSN Indenture which requires the calculation
of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio; or

(2) testing baskets set forth in the SSN Indenture,


-----

in each case, at the option of the Company or the Issuer (the Company’s or the Issuer’s election to
exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment,
an “LCA Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, may
be deemed to be the date the Definitive Agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition or
Irrevocable Repayment is entered into (the “LCA Test Date”). If, after giving pro forma effect to the
Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment and the other transactions to be entered into
in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as
if they had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period the Company could have taken
such action on the relevant LCA Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket
shall be deemed to have been complied with.

If the Company or the Issuer has made an LCA Election, then in connection with any subsequent
calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to the Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens,
or the making of Asset Dispositions, mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or
following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited
Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is consummated or the Definitive Agreement for such
Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment is terminated or expires without
consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, any such ratio or
basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition or
Irrevocable Repayment and other transactions in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. If the Company or the Issuer
has made an LCA Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or
tested as of the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket,
including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the Person subject to such
Limited Condition Acquisition or Irrevocable Repayment, at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations.

If (x) any restriction, basket, threshold or permission is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount (the “fixed component”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (in either
case, the “grower component”) and (y) the grower component of the applicable restriction, basket,
threshold or permission exceeds the applicable fixed component at any time, the fixed component shall
be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower component reached from time to time
and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower component.

If (x) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into
pursuant to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket and (y) at a later time would
subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based basket, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such
action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such
ratio-based basket.

If any amount is incurred or utilized under any ratio-based basket, such amount shall be permitted
notwithstanding any subsequent decline in the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio or any other financial ratio or metric.

**_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor (other than the Issuer) shall Guarantee any Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Company or a
Guarantor Incurred after (and not existing on, or provided for or required to be granted under written
agreements existing on), in the case of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Issue Date and,
in the case of the Target Group, the Wind Hellas Acquisition Closing Date, under any Credit Facility
or any Public Debt, unless such Restricted Subsidiary executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the SSN Indenture pursuant to which such


-----

Restricted Subsidiary will provide a SSN Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be obligated to Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such SSN Guarantee may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) any breach
or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or
shareholders or the partners of such partnership); (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses; or (d) an inconsistency with
the Agreed Security Principles or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. At the option of the Company
or the Issuer, any SSN Guarantee may contain limitations on such guarantor’s liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those
that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future SSN Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released at the option of the Company
or the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with
the SSN Indenture if such guarantor had not been designated as a guarantor or (ii) there is no
Indebtedness of such guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could
not have been Incurred in compliance with the SSN Indenture as at the date of such release if such
guarantor were not designated as a guarantor as at that date. The Trustee shall take all necessary actions
to effectuate any release of a SSN Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any
action that would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or
affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to
materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and
the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any
Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited
by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” _provided, that the Company and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled
“—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged,
transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the SSN Indenture, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge, transfer or release of
any Collateral or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the SSN Indenture, the Existing
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents
may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or
released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
assets) (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) for the purposes of
Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) to add to the Collateral; (iv) to make any other change thereto
that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect or (v) to amend, extend, renew, restate,
supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets) any Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking
a Permitted Reorganization and/or Permitted Tax Restructuring or a transaction not prohibited by the
covenant set forth under “—Merger and Consolidation”; provided, however, that in the case of clause


-----

(iv) and (v) above, no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement or modification or release (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Company or the Issuer
delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor
or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (2) a certificate from
the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency
of the person granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release, (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (3) an Opinion of
Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or
release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same asset),
the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets) and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the
Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the SSN Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured
Note issued under the SSN Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by
the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with
any of the Company’s or the Issuer’s obligations under the covenants described under “—
_Change of Control” above or under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”_
above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Senior Secured Notes which will constitute
an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(4) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written
notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the SSN
Indenture;


-----

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created
after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity (the “cross
acceleration provision”),

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of
€117 million and 12% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the Company, a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer, the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of
the Company), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of €117 million and 12% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any
amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments
are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final and
due (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value
in excess of the greater of €58 million and 6% of Consolidated EBITDA shall, at any time,
cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Security Document, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement and the SSN Indenture) for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the SSN Indenture or the release
or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the SSN Indenture,
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer, the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for ten days (the “security default provisions”);
and

(9) any SSN Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such SSN Guarantee or the SSN Indenture)
or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or
disaffirms in writing its obligations under its SSN Guarantee and any such Default continues
for ten days (the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), the Issuer
does not cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this
paragraph after receipt of such notice; _provided_ that such notice of Default may not be given with


-----

respect to any action taken and notified to the Trustee and Holders more than two years prior to such
notice of Default or Event of Default.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may,
and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to
be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration
of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under
“—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior
Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in
full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of
the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court
of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

Any notice of Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described
in clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of
Default under the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e)
of the first paragraph of this section) or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under
the first paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) of the first
paragraph of this section), notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under the first
paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) of the first paragraph
of this covenant) or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default the first
paragraph of this section (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) of the first paragraph
of this section) (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing
Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the
Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable,
the “Relevant Clearing System”) or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being
instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which
representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed
repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the
Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder
Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably
request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position
Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case
in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any
Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial
owner of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any
relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate (which shall be provided to the Holders) certifying that the Issuer (i) believes in good faith
that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its
Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent
jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its
Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically
stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such


-----

matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from
acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a
Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction
rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its
Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of
such Verification Covenant. If there is any breach of the Position Representation or failure to satisfy its
Verification Covenant in accordance with a final and non-appealable court determination or order, then
for purposes of determining the requisite level of consent for such Noteholder Direction, that breaching
Holder’s position shall be treated as “not outstanding” for purposes of determining the denominator in
the calculation of the requisite level of consent (and their position may not also be included in the
numerator); and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by
the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly
provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect
that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration
rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice
of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted
from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If
the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act
in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s
participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the SSN
Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with
such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described
above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction (provided that
the relevant Position Representations are provided in accordance with the provisions of the preceding
paragraph) or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the SSN Indenture without
verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not
be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the
foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under
the SSN Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement as the Trustee may determine in good faith (provided
that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud). The
Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder
has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position
Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to
determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification
Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or
investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make
any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any derivatives or Net Short position
or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on its rights, protections and benefits under the SSN
Indenture at all times, including without limitation, for actions that are taken and subsequently annulled.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured
Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part
of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under
the SSN Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured
Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not
less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind
any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission


-----

would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon any such
waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed
to have been cured for every purpose of the SSN Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Subject to the provisions of the SSN Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the SSN Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have
offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability,
fees or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the first
paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or
Verification Covenant;

(2) Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the first paragraph of this section,
Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant,
of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability, fees or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is
inconsistent with such request within such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee. The SSN Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required
in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of
its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
SSN Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or
that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the SSN Indenture,
the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it against all losses,
liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action.

The SSN Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed
of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60
days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long
as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written
notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.


-----

The SSN Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is secured and/or indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly,
in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of
security or indemnification to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the SSN
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents
and the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The SSN Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) if any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to
deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the SSN Indenture, such Default or
Event of Default, shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such
covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the
prescribed period specified in the SSN Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any time periods prescribed in the SSN Indenture to cure any actual or
alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default
or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured
Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect the Fixed Rate SSNs or the FRNs or
another series of senior secured notes issued under the SSN Indenture, only the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate SSNs or FRNs (and not the consent of
the holders of the majority of all senior secured notes issued under the SSN Indenture), as the case may
be, shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes affected (provided, however, that if any amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect the Fixed Rate SSNs, the FRNs or
another series of senior secured notes issued under the SSN Indenture, only the consent of the holders
of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate SSNs, FRNs or
other series of senior secured notes issued under the SSN Indenture, as the case may be, shall be
required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior
Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note;


-----

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change
the time at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described
above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior
Secured Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment
of principal or interest on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the
due dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the SSN Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes”
that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material
respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss
of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any
obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay
Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release (i) any security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral or (ii) any
SSN Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Document, the
SSN Indenture or the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and
a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, the SSN Indenture shall not include any provision incorporating, giving
effect to, or otherwise reflecting the provisions of Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the_
relevant Note Document or reduce the minimum denomination of the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer, the Company
or any Guarantor under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior
Secured Notes;

(4) add to the covenants for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred
upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Issuer or the Company or an Officer of the Issuer or the Company) for the issuance of
Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(7) add Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, add security to or for the benefit of
the Senior Secured Notes, or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or


-----

retaking of any SSN Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents)
with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge
or retaking is provided for under the SSN Indenture, the Existing Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the SSN Indenture of a
successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Note Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, (i) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, in any property which is
required by the Security Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to
grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security
interest is not prohibited by the SSN Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with or (ii) as otherwise provided in_
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”; or

(10) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets._

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to receive and rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates
and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the SSN Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the SSN Indenture by any
Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes (or a series thereof)
will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The SSN Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating
the offer or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

A Senior Secured Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer, the Company, an Affiliate
of the Company, or any fund or other entity controlled, managed or advised by any direct or indirect
shareholder of the Company (or, in each case, any successor thereof) holds the Senior Secured Note;
_provided that in determining whether the holders of the requisite majority of outstanding Senior Secured_
Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder,
Senior Secured Notes owned by the Issuer, the Company, an Affiliate of the Company, or any fund or
other entity controlled, managed by or advised by any direct or indirect shareholder of the Company
(or, in each case, any successor thereof) shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding if a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such ownership at least two Business
Days prior to the date of such determination. Prior to the receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall be
entitled to assume that none of the Senior Secured Notes are owned by the Issuer, the Company, an
Affiliate of the Company, or any fund or other entity controlled, managed by or advised by any direct
or indirect shareholder of the Company (or, in each case, any successor thereof). For the avoidance of
doubt, provision of such notice shall not be an obligation of the Company or the Issuer.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes and the SSN Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of
Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in


-----

connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration
of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance
of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the
foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Company”
and clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and default provisions relating to_
such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the
Company, the Issuer and its Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee
provision and the security default provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant
defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such
Senior Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, payment of such Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Company” and clauses
(A), (B) and (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—
_Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (other than with respect to the Issuer), (7), (8) or (9) under “—_
_Events of Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured
Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that
beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of
legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling received from, or
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal
income tax law since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided
for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The SSN Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will be
discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or


-----

exchange of the Senior Secured Notes, or any other provisions in the SSN Indenture that survive
satisfaction and discharge of the SSN Indenture as expressly provided for in the SSN Indenture) as to
all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and
certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the
funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b)
all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become
due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are
to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent)
by the Trustee for this purpose), euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, as applicable in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness
on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have
become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the
Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the SSN Indenture; (4) the Issuer has
delivered irrevocable instructions to both the Paying Agent and the Trustee under the SSN Indenture to
apply the deposited money towards payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the SSN Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of_
the SSN Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
If requested in writing by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders
prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders
shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date
(which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and
payment to Holders prior to Stated Maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any
negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators and Shareholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance
of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee, the Security Agent and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited will be appointed as Trustee under the SSN Indenture. The SSN Indenture
will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer
of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically
in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
SSN Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own
affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee and the Security Agent to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the SSN Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The SSN Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee or the Security Agent may retire or
be removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee or the Security
Agent may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then


-----

outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and
(2) that if the Trustee or the Security Agent at any time (a) has or acquires actual knowledge of a conflict
of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or acting as Security
Agent or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee or the Security Agent,
or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee or the Security Agent and appointment of a successor Trustee or a successor
Security Agent.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The SSN Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee or the Security Agent
for any loss, liability, taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud
on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the SSN Indenture.
Each of the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any
Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel, as applicable, in formulating its opinion or in taking any
action (including, without limitation, release of a SSN Guarantee or Collateral) under the SSN
Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel, as applicable, without
need for investigation or verification, except as may otherwise be provided for under the terms of the
SSN Indenture.

The Trustee, the Security Agent, any Paying Agent and all other such agents will be permitted to engage
in other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee, the Security
Agent or any other agent becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Senior Secured Notes,
it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, the Security
Agent, any Paying Agent or any other such agent.

**Notices**

Any notice or communication sent to a Holder of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes shall be
in writing and shall be validly given if mailed or delivered by (i) first-class mail, postage prepaid, (ii)
by hand delivery to the Holder at the Holder’s address or (iii) electronically delivered, in each case as
it appears on the registration books of the Registrar, with a copy to the Trustee. At the Issuer’s request,
the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall mail or deliver such notices or communications to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes in the Issuer’s name and at the Issuer’s expense. For so
long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Senior Secured Notes, all notices to Holders
will be delivered to the Relevant Clearing System in accordance with the applicable procedures of the
Relevant Clearing System, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
paragraph, which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and if and for so long as the rules of Authority shall so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of
any notice with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

Each notice or communication shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or,
if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided
that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such
publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder
of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
If a notice or communication is given via the Relevant Clearing System, it will be deemed to have been
duly given on the day the notice is given to the Relevant Clearing System.

If a notice or communication is provided in the manner provided in the preceding three paragraphs, as
applicable, it is duly given, whether or not a Holder or holder of a beneficial interest in the Senior


-----

Secured Notes receives it. Failure to send a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall
not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will
be prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees, as the case
may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether
as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the windingup or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect
of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to
the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able
to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt
or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under
any Senior Secured Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained
by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify
the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase.
For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter
stated therein for the Holder or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These
indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and
will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note, any SSN Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in
a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for
permission to be granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange. There can be no
assurance that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will
be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and
settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if
any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the
SSN Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the SSN Indenture,
the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the SSN
Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States. The SSN Indenture
will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint Corporation Service Company as its agent
for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the SSN Indenture and the Senior
Secured Notes brought in the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New
York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the
parties thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the SSN Indenture (including the SSN
Guarantees) and the Senior Secured Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). The
Security Documents, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and
constituted in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Bulgaria.

-----

approved by any managing director(s) or by a majority of the directors or managers (excluding

“Bund Rate” means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of the Federal
Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled and

redemption date to the applicable date set forth above is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct
obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund

(1) since the beginning of such period, such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary has disposed of
any company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business
(any such disposition, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio is such a Sale, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be
reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets
which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the
Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable thereto for such period; provided that if any
such sale constitutes “discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated Net

an adjustment pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above if made by such Person or a Restricted
Subsidiary since the beginning of such period, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be
calculated after giving _pro forma effect thereto, including anticipated synergies and cost_
savings, as if such Sale or Purchase occurred on the first day of such period; and

(4) since the beginning of such period, a transfer of shares of, or other transaction has occurred or
is contractually committed with respect to, such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary, that
constitutes an event that is contemplated by the definition of “Specified Change of Control
_Event” (any such transaction, a “Specified Change of Control Transaction”), and solely for the_
purpose of making the determination pursuant to “Specified Change of Control Event,”
Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto
(including anticipated synergies and expenses and cost savings expected to be obtained from
the Specified Change of Control Transaction) as if such Specified Change of Control
Transaction (including such synergies and expenses and cost savings) had occurred on the first
day of such period.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Leverage,
Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Income
Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as

been initiated by such Person or its Restricted Subsidiaries as though such cost savings programs had
been fully implemented on the first day of the Relevant Testing Period, (b) in determining the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination, _pro forma effect shall be given to any_
Incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of
Indebtedness or causing any Reserved Indebtedness Amount to be deemed to be Incurred during the
Relevant Testing Period as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the Relevant Testing
Period, (c) pro forma effect shall be given to anticipated acquisitions which have become subject to
Definitive Agreements, (d) Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” as of the date of determination
shall be excluded, (e) the discharge on the Determination Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that
the discharge of such Indebtedness results from proceeds Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
shall not be given effect, (f) calculations shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run-rate effect
of carriage contracts that have been entered into on or prior to the date of determination but which have
not yet been fully reflected in the Relevant Testing Period (as determined and calculated by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of such Person or the Company) as if entered into on the first

###### BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United
States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the
Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Senior Secured Notes may only be offered or sold within the United States pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Ownership of interests in the respective Global Notes (the “Book-entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through
such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive certificated form.

Book-entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in the book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form
(“Definitive Registered Notes”). The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or
pledge Book-entry Interests. In addition, while the Senior Secured Notes are in global form, holders of
Book-entry Interests will not receive physical delivery of the Senior Secured Notes in certificated form
and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Senior Secured Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream (or the common depositary’s nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the
Global Notes for all purposes under the SSN Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. In addition,
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Bookentry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes
under the SSN Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book-entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of
such Book-entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We
understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Senior
Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective


-----

participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange
or depositary requirements; _provided, however, that no Book-entry Interest of less than € 100,000_
principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments
to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. We will make payments of all
such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as
described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes.” If any such deduction or withholding is
required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”
above, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by
any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-entry Interests after such deduction or withholding to
equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such
Global Note or Book-entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We
expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the SSN Indenture, the Issuer, Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, Registrar or
any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the applicable Global Note (i.e. the
common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose
of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, Trustee, Paying
Agent, Transfer Agent, Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or
liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-entry Interest, or Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant;

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant
or indirect participant relating to payments made on account of a Book-entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “stock name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-entry
Interests are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream


-----

will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in
respect of the Global Notes.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to
persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder
of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set out in the SSN Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Book-entry Interests may only be transferred in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any
applicable jurisdiction.

Through the 40-day distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global
Note denominated in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the SSN Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule
144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions”
and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions. After the expiration of the 40-day period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule
144A Senior Secured Note without compliance with these certification requirements.

Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-entry
Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the SSN Indenture, owners of the Book-entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

- if the owner of a Book-entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through
either Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the SSN Indenture, and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the SSN Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or the Transfer Agent. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one
Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of
the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no


-----

Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than € 100,000 will be issued. We will bear the cost
of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Senior Secured
Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Senior Secured Notes or (iii) any date fixed for selection
of the Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn)
for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset disposition offer. In the event of the
transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar may
require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as
described in the SSN Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and
permitted by the SSN Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated
and is surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee
(or an authentication agent appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note
if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of
both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar appointed
pursuant to the SSN Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered
Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive
Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer, pursuant to the
provisions of the SSN Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-entry Interests in the Global
Notes only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided
in the SSN Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable
to such notes. Please see “Transfer Restrictions.”

Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will
be payable at the office of the Issuer’s paying agent in London.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar and their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership
of the Senior Secured Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered
office of the registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Senior Secured Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the applicable series of Notes;
however, owners of the Book-entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the
maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by
that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying


-----

Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations
or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of
such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-entry System**

The Senior Secured Notes represented by their respective Global Notes are expected to be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes representing the Senior Secured
Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent,
the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or
Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under
the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Senior Secured Notes will be made in euro. Book-entry Interests owned
through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against
payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

###### TAX CONSIDERATIONS

**Taxation in the Netherlands**

This section outlines the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, settlement,
redemption and disposal of the Senior Secured Notes. It does not present a comprehensive or complete
description of all aspects of Dutch tax law which could be relevant to a holder of Notes (a “Noteholder”).
For Dutch tax purposes, a Noteholder may include an individual or entity that does not hold the legal
title of the Senior Secured Notes, but to whom or to which, the Senior Secured Notes are, or income
from the Senior Secured Notes is, nevertheless attributed based either on this individual or entity owning
a beneficial interest in the Senior Secured Notes or on specific statutory provisions. These include
statutory provisions attributing the Senior Secured Notes to an individual who is, or who has directly
or indirectly inherited from a person who was, the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust,
foundation or similar entity that holds the Senior Secured Notes.

This section is intended as general information only. Prospective Noteholders should consult their own
tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of any acquisition, holding or disposal of the Senior Secured
Notes.

This section is based on Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published
and in effect on the date of this offering memorandum, including the tax rates applicable on that date,
without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without
retroactive effect.

Any reference in this section made to Dutch taxes, Dutch tax or Dutch tax law should be construed as
a reference to any taxes of any nature levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions
or taxing authorities or to the law governing such taxes, respectively. The Netherlands means the part
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands located in Europe.

This section does not describe any Dutch tax considerations or consequences that may be relevant where
a Noteholder:

(i) is an individual and the Noteholder’s income or capital gains derived from the Senior Secured
Notes are attributable to employment activities, the income from which is taxable in the
Netherlands;

(ii) has a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or a fictitious substantial interest (fictief
_aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer within the meaning of chapter 4 of the Dutch Income Tax Act_
2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally, a Noteholder has a substantial interest in the
Issuer if the Noteholder, alone or—in the case of an individual—together with a partner for Dutch
tax purposes, or any relative by blood or by marriage in the ascending or descending line
(including foster children) of the Noteholder or the partner, owns or holds, or is deemed to own
or hold, certain rights to shares, including rights to directly or indirectly acquire shares, directly
or indirectly representing 5% or more of the Issuer’s issued capital as a whole or for any class of
shares or profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) relating to 5% or more of the Issuer’s
annual profits or 5% or more of the Issuer’s liquidation proceeds;

(iii) is an entity that, although it is in principle subject to Dutch corporate income tax under the Dutch
Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969) (the “CITA”), is not
subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is fully or partly exempt from Dutch corporate income
tax (such as a qualifying pension fund as described in section 5 CITA and a tax exempt
investment fund (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 6a CITA);

(iv) is an investment institution (beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 28 CITA; or


-----

(v) that is an entity which is a resident of Aruba, Curacao or St. Maarten and fully or partly conducts
a business through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative
(vaste vertegenwoordiger) in Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba to which the Senior Secured Notes
are attributable.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Any payments made under the Senior Secured Notes will not be subject to withholding or deduction
for, or on account of, any Dutch taxes, unless withholding Tax is imposed under the Dutch Withholding
Tax Act 2021 (Wet Bronbelasting 2021) (as described below).

A Noteholder will not be subject to withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Dutch Taxes,
unless a Noteholder is a Related Entity and:

(i) is resident in a state that qualifies as a low taxed jurisdiction or a jurisdiction that is listed on the
European Union list of non-cooperative jurisdictions (“Listed Jurisdictions”); or

(ii) is resident in another state, but the interest under the Senior Secured Notes is allocated by the
Noteholder to a permanent establishment situated in one of the Listed Jurisdictions; or

(iii) is considered tax transparent under the laws of its residence state, not being one of the Listed
Jurisdictions, and is not able to make use of an applicable rebuttal scheme; or

(iv) is entitled to the interest with the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, to avoid taxation
due on the interest received in respect of the Senior Secured Notes by another entity and holds
the interest, or is deemed to hold the interest, as part of an artificial arrangement or transaction
(or a series of artificial arrangements or composite of transactions).

If the conditions above are satisfied, interest, including original issue discount, under the Senior Secured
Notes will be subject to a Dutch withholding tax at a rate of 25.8%.

An entity is considered a Related Entity if:

(i) it has a Qualifying Interest in the Issuer;

(ii) the Issuer has a Qualifying Interest in the Noteholder; or

(iii) a third party has a Qualifying Interest in both the Issuer and the entity holding the Senior Secured
Notes.

The term Qualifying Interest means a direct or indirectly held interest—either by an entity individually
or jointly if an entity is part of a collaborating group (samenwerkende groep)—that enables such entity
or such collaborating group to exercise a definite influence over another entities' decisions, such as the
Issuer or the Noteholder as the case may be, and allows it to determine the other entities' activities.

A jurisdiction is considered low taxed if it is designated as such in an annually updated ministerial
decree of the Dutch Ministry of Finance. At the date of this prospectus, the designated low taxed
jurisdictions are the American Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Anguilla, the Bahamas, Bahrain,
Barbados, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Fiji, Guam, Guernsey, the Isle of
Man, Jersey, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, the Turks and Caicos Islands,
Vanuatu and the United Arab Emirates.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

_Residents of the Netherlands_


-----

The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following
Noteholders:

(i) individuals who are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Dutch Resident
Individuals”); and

(ii) entities or enterprises that are subject to the CITA and are resident or deemed to be resident in
the Netherlands (“Dutch Resident Corporate Entities”).

_Dutch Resident Individuals engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous_
_activities_

Dutch Resident Individuals engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous
activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) are generally subject to income tax at statutory
progressive rates with a maximum of 49.50% on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the
Senior Secured Notes, including any capital gains realized on any disposal of the Senior Secured Notes,
where those benefits are attributable to:

(i) an enterprise from which a Dutch Resident Individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur
(ondernemer) or by being co-entitled (medegerechtigde) to the net worth of the enterprise other
than as an entrepreneur or shareholder; or

(ii) miscellaneous activities, including activities beyond the scope of active portfolio investment
activities (meer dan normaal vermogensbeheer).

_Dutch Resident Individuals not engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous_
_activities_

Generally, the Senior Secured Notes held by a Dutch Resident Individual who is not engaged or deemed
to be engaged in an enterprise or in miscellaneous activities, or who is so engaged or deemed to be
engaged but the Senior Secured Notes are not attributable to that enterprise or miscellaneous activities,
will be subject to annual income tax imposed on a fictitious yield on the Senior Secured Notes under
the regime for savings and investments (inkomen uit sparen en beleggen). Irrespective of the actual
income or capital gains realized, the annual taxable benefit from a Dutch Resident Individual’s assets
and liabilities taxed under this regime, including the Senior Secured Notes, is set at a percentage of the
positive balance of the fair market value of those assets, including the Senior Secured Notes, and the
fair market value of these liabilities. The percentage increases as follows:

(i) from 1.82% over the first €50,650 of such positive balance;

(ii) to 4.37% over any excess positive balance between €50,650.01 up to and including €962,350;
and

(iii) to a maximum of 5.53% over any excess positive balance of €962,350.01 or higher.

These percentages will be reassessed each year and the amounts under (i) to (iii) will be adjusted for
inflation each year. No taxation occurs if this positive balance does not exceed a certain threshold
(heffingvrij vermogen). The fair market value of assets, including the Senior Secured Notes, and
liabilities that are taxed under this regime is measured once in each calendar year on January 1. For
2022, the tax rate under the regime for savings and investments is a flat rate of 31%.

_Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_

Dutch Resident Corporate Entities are generally subject to corporate income tax at statutory rates up to
25.8% on any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the Senior Secured Notes, including any
capital gains realized on their disposal.

_Non-Residents of the Netherlands_

The description of certain Dutch tax consequences in this paragraph is only intended for the following
Noteholders:

(i) individuals who are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch
Resident Individuals”); and

(ii) entities that are not resident and not deemed to be resident in the Netherlands (“Non-Dutch
Resident Corporate Entities”).

_Non-Dutch Resident Individuals_

A Non-Dutch Resident Individual will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains
derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes, other than
withholding tax as described above, unless:

(i) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives profits from an enterprise, whether as entrepreneur
or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of this enterprise other than as an entrepreneur or
shareholder, and this enterprise is fully or partly carried on through a permanent establishment
(vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, to
which the Senior Secured Notes are attributable;

(ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual derives benefits from miscellaneous activities carried on in
the Netherlands in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, including activities which are beyond the
scope of active portfolio investment activities; or

(iii) the Non-Dutch Resident Individual is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—in the
profits of an enterprise, which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which the Senior
Secured Notes are attributable.

_Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities_

A Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital
gains derived from the purchase, ownership and disposal or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes, other
than withholding tax as described above, unless:

(i) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity derives profits from an enterprise, which is fully or
partly carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the
Netherlands to which the Senior Secured Notes are attributable; or

(ii) the Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entity is entitled to a share—other than by way of securities—
in the profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise, which is
effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which the Senior Secured Notes are attributable.

Under certain specific circumstances, Dutch taxation rights may be restricted for Non-Dutch Resident
Individuals and Non-Dutch Resident Corporate Entities pursuant to treaties for the avoidance of double
taxation.

**_Dutch Gift Tax or Inheritance Tax_**

No Dutch gift tax or inheritance tax is due in respect of any gift of the Senior Secured Notes by, or
inheritance of the Senior Secured Notes on the death of, a Noteholder, unless:

(i) the Noteholder is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time of the gift
or death of the Noteholder;


-----

(ii) the Noteholder dies within 180 days after the date of the gift of the Senior Secured Notes and
was, or was deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands at the time of the Noteholder’s death but
not at the time of the gift; or

(iii) the gift of the Senior Secured Notes is made under a condition precedent and the Noteholder is
resident, or is deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

No other Dutch taxes, including taxes of a documentary nature, such as capital tax, stamp or registration
tax or duty, are payable by the Company or by, or on behalf of, the Noteholder by reason only of the
issue, acquisition or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Residency_**

A Noteholder will not become a resident or deemed resident of the Netherlands by reason only of
holding the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

**_General_**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder (as
defined below), except for the discussion under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” in
connection with the purchase, ownership and disposition of Senior Secured Notes acquired pursuant the
Offering. This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects and deals
only with Senior Secured Notes that are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) by a U.S. Holder who acquires the
Senior Secured Notes upon their original issuance pursuant to the Offering at their “issue price” (the
first price at which a substantial amount of the Senior Secured Notes of a series is sold to investors for
cash, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers).

A “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Senior Secured Notes that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes any of the following:

- an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or

- a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one
or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2)
has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations (“Treasury
Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon the federal income tax laws of the United States, including provisions of
the Code, Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions, published administrative positions of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as of the date hereof.
Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income
tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not sought and will not seek any
ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following
summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and
conclusions or that a court would not sustain a challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. A different


-----

tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Senior Secured Notes from those
discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in
respect of an investment in the Senior Secured Notes.

This summary is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income tax or all tax
considerations that may be relevant to U.S. Holders in light of their particular circumstances, and it does
not address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S.
federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws). This summary also does not address the base
erosion and anti-abuse tax under Section 59A of the Code, alternative minimum tax or Medicare
contribution tax consequences, if any. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the
U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders that are subject to special treatment
under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address all of the tax
consequences applicable to:

- holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the
mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions,
individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real
estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and investors in such entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance
companies;

- persons holding the Senior Secured Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or
conversion transaction or a straddle;

- persons that have ceased to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States or
entities covered by the anti-inversion rules;

- U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or value); or

- persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Senior
Secured Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status
of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. U.S. Holders that are partnerships, or
partners of a partnership holding the Senior Secured Notes, should consult their tax advisors regarding
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes.

U.S. Holders considering the purchase of Senior Secured Notes should consult their own tax advisors
concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Senior Secured Notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under other U.S.
federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction. The following discussion of certain U.S.
federal income tax considerations is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful
tax planning and advice.

**_Characterization of the Senior Secured Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments
on the Senior Secured Notes (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”) or make additional payments in redemption of the Senior Secured Notes in_
addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption of the Senior Secured Notes,”_
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption—Change of Control” and
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”).


-----

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the payments of such
additional amounts or additional payments in redemption of the Senior Secured Notes does not result
in the Senior Secured Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable
Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the Issue Date
of the Senior Secured Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or
incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the Senior Secured Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding
on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year
during which such U.S. Holder acquires the Senior Secured Notes that it is taking a different position.
However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described
above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Senior Secured Notes based upon
a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which
we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions
otherwise similar to those of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, some or all of any gain on the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Notes may be
recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the
tax consequences of the Senior Secured Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Senior Secured Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Interest_**

We expect, and this discussion assumes, that the Senior Secured Notes will not be considered as issued
with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Senior Secured Notes
will be treated as issued without OID if the difference between their principal amount and their issue
price is less than the product of one- fourth of one percent (0.25 percent) of their principal amount
multiplied by the number of full years to their maturity. In general, however, if the Senior Secured
Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder will be required to
include OID in gross income, as ordinary income, under a “constant-yield method” before the receipt
of cash attributable to such income, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Senior Secured Note generally will
be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with the
U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the
Senior Secured Notes, which includes any non-U.S. tax withheld from the interest payments received,
a U.S. Holder will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any such
tax withheld and without reduction for any non-U.S. tax withheld from any such additional amounts.
U.S. Holders may be entitled to deduct or credit non-U.S. withholding tax, subject to certain limitations
(including that the election to deduct or credit non-U.S. taxes applies to all of the U.S. Holder’s
applicable non-U.S. taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any additional amounts)
generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credits,
generally will be considered passive category income. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are
complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign
tax credit under their particular circumstances.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable in euros. A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar
value of the euro payment received, determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the
date of receipt regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S.
Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but such
U.S. Holder may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so
received.


-----

A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes may
determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of
two methods. Under the first method, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income for each
taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by
translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such
interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the
part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to
translate interest income at the spot rate on:

- the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable
years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable
year); or

- the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of
the accrual period.

If a U.S. Holder elects to use the second method, the election must be applied consistently to all debt
obligations the U.S. Holder holds from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the
IRS.

U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Senior Secured Note
(including, upon the disposition of a Senior Secured Note, the receipt of proceeds which include
amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), U.S. Holders who use the
accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss
(taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on
the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income the U.S. Holder previously included
in income with respect to such payment, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S.
dollars. Such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Senior Secured Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note,
a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized
upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to
any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above) and the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note, in each case as determined in U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Senior Secured Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost for
that Senior Secured Note decreased by the amount of any payments of principal previously made in
respect of such Note. If a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of the Senior Secured Notes in
exchange for currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar
value of the currency received. If the Senior Secured Notes are traded on an established securities
market when the U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of the Senior Secured Notes, the amount
realized will be, in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis U.S. Holders, determined using the
spot rate on the settlement date. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not elect to determine the amount
realized using the spot exchange rate on the settlement date will recognize foreign currency gain or loss
equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot exchange
rates in effect on the date of the sale or other disposition and the settlement date. A U.S. Holder will
have a tax basis in the currency received equal to the U.S. dollar value of the currency received at the
spot rate on the settlement date. Any foreign currency gain or loss realized on the settlement date or the
subsequent sale or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency received for a different dollar amount
generally will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss, and will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate


-----

applicable to long-term capital gains. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes the election previously
described, it must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be
revoked without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder from
the sale, exchange redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note
generally will be capital gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
Holder has held the Senior Secured Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Note. Long-term capital gains
of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of
taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by U.S.
Holders on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured
Note generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors about how to account for proceeds received on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note that are not paid in U.S. dollars.

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note,
a U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be
U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Senior Secured Note is a U.S.
Holder’s purchase price for the Senior Secured Note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and
the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar
value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal
amount determined on the date the U.S. Holder purchased the Senior Secured Note. In addition, upon
the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note, an accrual basis
U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received
with respect to accrued interest which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of
_Interest.” The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Senior Secured Note_
(with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss
realized on the disposition of the Senior Secured Note.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Pushdown”). Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown references to_
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the SSN Indenture shall
apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the
Issuer shall remain the same entity. In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
would be released from its obligations under the SSN Indenture. Such a modification to the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange
of (i) the Senior Secured Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) modified Senior Secured
Notes as in place after such modifications (“Modified Notes”). If such modifications result in a deemed
exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes could be required to recognize
gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Senior
Secured Note for a Modified Note would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the Modified
Note. The issue price of a Modified Note will equal the fair market value of such Senior Secured Note
or such Modified Note at the time of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, such Senior Secured Note
or such Modified Note were considered “publicly traded” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the
IPO Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s
holding period in a Modified Note treated as received in the IPO Pushdown generally will commence
on the day after the IPO Pushdown, and tax basis in such Modified Note would generally equal the issue
price of such Modified Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed exchange
will be taxed under the rules described above under “—Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or


-----

_Other Taxable Disposition of Senior Secured Notes.” If the issue price of such Modified Note is less_
than its stated redemption price at maturity by more than a de minimis amount, such Modified Note will
be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would
be required to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt
of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S.
federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Senior Secured Notes in connection
with the IPO Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange
and resulting OID, if any.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions cover transactions
generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under such
Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured
Note (or euros received in respect of a Senior Secured Note) to the extent that such sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount.
U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with
respect to an investment in the Senior Secured Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements may apply to payments of principal and interest on a
Senior Secured Note or the proceeds from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Senior Secured Note unless a U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required,
demonstrates this fact. Additionally, if a U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient fails to provide its
accurate taxpayer identification number and to make certain certifications, such U.S. Holder may be
subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Certain U.S. Holders who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in section
6038D of the Code) exceeding certain threshold amounts generally are required to report information
relating to such assets, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Secured Notes generally will constitute
specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Senior Secured
Notes are held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions. U.S. Holders should consult their
own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to their ownership and
disposition of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”) a “foreign financial institution” may be
required to withhold at a rate of 30% on interest income paid on a debt obligation to persons who fail
to meet certain requirements if such interest income is treated as a “foreign passthru payment”
attributable to certain U.S. source payments. However, under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations issued
in December 2018 (and upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued), such
withholding does not apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two
years after the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru
payments” are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the
date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued
generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified more than six
months after such date. As of the date of this offering memorandum, applicable final Treasury
Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution,


-----

FATCA would apply to payments on the Senior Secured Notes only if there is a significant modification
of the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the
rules described herein. Investors should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to
their investment in the Senior Secured Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed
with respect to any payments on the Senior Secured Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts
payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Withholding Tax in Certain other Jurisdictions**

**_Slovenia_**

Any payments made by a Slovenian Guarantor on or under the Senior Secured Notes or the SSN
Guarantees will be qualified either as the payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest. Generally,
any such payments to a foreign person that qualify as the payment of interest will be subject to
withholding tax in Slovenia. No withholding tax is payable on the payment of principal. After a
Slovenian Guarantor has settled an obligation on or under the Senior Secured Notes or the SSN
Guarantees, the Guarantor must establish a receivable towards the Issuer in the amount of the settled
obligation. If a Slovenian Guarantor does not establish a receivable towards the Issuer, the payment
made by the Guarantor on or under the Senior Secured Notes or the SSN Guarantees might be
characterized as a hidden distribution of profit (i.e., a payment of dividend to the Issuer). In this case,
withholding tax would be due on the entire amount of the payment (and not only on the portion
representing the payment of interest).

According to Article 70 of the Slovenian Corporate Income Tax Act, withholding tax is imposed on
certain income of non-residents from a Slovenian source, including dividends and income similar to
dividends, interest (subject to certain exceptions), royalties, rent for Slovenian real estate, income from
sports or art performances (through an intermediate entity) or from consulting, marketing, legal and
certain other services when payments for such services are made to entities established in black listed
countries (tax havens).

The standard withholding tax rate is 15% and in certain situations in more detail regulated in the Tax
Procedure Act it can, with effect from January 1, 2020, be 27.5%. It is the responsibility of the Slovenian
payer (e.g., a legal entity, a sole entrepreneur, a business unit of a non-resident, for example, a Slovenian
branch of a foreign company or an agent) to withhold the tax at the relevant rate at the time of payment
of Slovenian sourced income.

In certain cases it is, however, possible to apply for a reduced withholding tax rate or even an exemption
from withholding tax. Such benefits may be available under double taxation agreements Slovenia has
entered into with foreign countries. Moreover, Slovenia has fully transposed the EU Parent Subsidiary
Directive (2011/96/EU) and the EU Interest and Royalty Directive (2003/49/EC) into its national law,
which exempt transactions between certain types of companies from withholding tax, if the parties meet
the requirements on the volume and the duration of shareholding.

**_Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina_**

Withholding tax in Bosnia and Herzegovina is regulated by entity level legislation, in Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Corporate Income Tax Act of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(Official gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nos. 15/16 and 15/20).

Withholding tax is imposed on non-resident persons on income generated in the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina from dividends, interest or financial equivalent based on the financial instruments or
arrangements, intellectual property fees, management, consulting, audit and similar intellectual
services, asset leases, entertainment events, insurance and reinsurance, and telecommunication services.


-----

The general withholding tax rate is 10%, except for income generated from dividends, which is taxable
at the rate of 5%, in each case unless a double taxation treaty, if any, provides otherwise.

Income generated by non-resident entities from interest on loans and credits granted to resident entities
for the purpose of investment in production equipment, as well as from interest on state issued securities,
is exempt from withholding tax. In addition, income generated by reinsurance premiums paid by local
reinsurers is exempt from withholding tax.

Withholding tax is directly calculated and charged by the resident entity making the payment to a nonresident (or otherwise settling payment obligation towards non-resident), prior to the actual payment/
settlement of payment obligation, with the resident paying the withholding tax on behalf of the nonresident.

**_Luxembourg_**

The comments below are intended as a basic summary of certain withholding tax consequences in
relation to the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Senior Secured Notes under Luxembourg law.
Persons who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult a professional tax adviser.

Under Luxembourg tax law currently in effect and subject to the exception below, there is no
Luxembourg withholding tax on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) or
repayments of principal.

In accordance with the law of December 23, 2005, as amended, interest payments made by Luxembourg
paying agents to individual beneficial owners resident in Luxembourg are currently subject to a 20%
withholding tax. Responsibility for withholding such tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying
agent.

In addition, pursuant to the law of December 23, 2005, as amended, Luxembourg resident individuals
can opt to self-declare and pay a 20% tax (the “Levy”) on interest payments made by paying agents
located in a Member State of the European Union other than Luxembourg or a Member State of the
European Economic Area.

The 20% withholding tax as described above or the Levy will be in full discharge of income tax if the
beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth.

**_Greece_**

The following is an overview of certain Greek withholding tax consequences in relation to the purchase
and ownership of the Senior Secured Notes. This discussion is not exhaustive and does not purport to
address all the tax consequences applicable to all possible categories of investors, some of which may
be subject to special rules, and also does not discuss procedural requirements. Individual holders are
assumed not to be acting in the course of business for tax purposes. “Greek tax residents” include, with
respect to corporate holders, the permanent establishment in Greece of a foreign legal person or entity
where the Senior Secured Notes are held through that permanent establishment. The Senior Secured
Notes are intended to be listed on a trading venue within the EU or on an organized stock market outside
the EU which is supervised by a regulatory authority accredited by the International Organization of
Securities Commissions, such as the Exchange.

Prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the laws of Greece and other
tax consequences of the purchase and ownership of the Senior Secured Notes.

_Payments of principal under the Senior Secured Notes_

No withholding tax will be imposed on payments of principal to any holder of the Senior Secured Notes.


-----

_Payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes by the Issuer_

Interest income arising under the Senior Secured Notes that is paid to:

(i) Non-Greek tax residents

Both individual and corporate holders who are non-Greek tax residents should be exempt from Greek
income and withholding tax in respect of payments of interest on or under the Senior Secured Notes
made by the Issuer.

(ii) Greek tax residents

_Individual holders: Payments of interest on or under the Senior Secured Notes made by the Issuer to_
individual (non-corporate) holders who are Greek tax residents are subject to income tax at a flat rate
of 15%. If payment of interest is effected through a paying agent in Greece, the entire income tax of
15% shall be withheld. Interest on or under the Senior Secured Notes shall be subject to a further tax
called “solidarity contribution,” the rate of which rises progressively from 2.2% to 10% and is calculated
with reference to both taxable and tax exempt annual income exceeding €12,000. Greek Law 4799/2021
provides for an exemption from the solidarity contribution in respect of individual holders for the tax
year ending December 31, 2021.

_Corporate holders: Payments of interest on or under the Senior Secured Notes made by the Issuer to_
holders which are legal persons or entities and Greek tax residents will be treated as part of their annual
corporate income. The corporate income tax rate is currently 22%. Credit institutions that have
submitted in the scope of the special regime of article 27A of Greek Law 4172/2013 on the Deferred
Tax Assets (DTA) are taxed at 29%. If payment of interest is effected through a paying agent in Greece,
a withholding tax of 15% applies, which will be treated as an advance payment over income tax for the
respective tax year.

_Payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes by Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. (the “Greek_
_Guarantor”)_

Interest income arising under the Senior Secured Notes that is paid to:

(i) Non-Greek tax residents

Interest payments on or under the Senior Secured Notes to non-Greek tax residents by the Greek
Guarantor should be subject to the same treatment as interest payments made by the Issuer, unless the
Greek tax administration takes a different view.

(ii) Greek tax residents

Both individual and corporate holders who are Greek tax residents shall be taxed in the manner
described above for Greek tax residents in relation to interest payments made by the Issuer. However,
the Greek Guarantor may be treated as a paying agent in Greece and may therefore have to effect the
withholding of 15% in respect of payments to both individual and corporate holders.

**Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of interest on Notes, such payments may be subject to
withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of
any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that
such payments by such Guarantor will be eligible for all the exemptions described above.

###### CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Senior Secured
Notes by (i) employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) entities and accounts whose underlying
assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement, (iv) any other
retirement plan or account that is subject to any other U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local or other laws
or regulations that are similar to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title
I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws” and each of the foregoing
described in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a “Plan”).

**_General Fiduciary Matters_**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the
assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any
person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA
Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary
of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Senior Secured Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a
fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments
governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a
fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of
control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar
Laws. In addition, each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates (i) will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Senior Secured Notes, and (ii) is undertaking to provide any advice or
recommendation, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision.
The decision to purchase and hold the Senior Secured Notes must be made by each prospective Plan
purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**_Prohibited Transaction Issues_**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the
meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless
an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA
and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or
holding of the Senior Secured Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, or the Guarantors is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or
result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of
the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class
or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or
“PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Senior Secured Notes. These class
exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent
qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate
accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life
insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house


-----

asset managers. Each of the above noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its
application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering acquiring and/or holdings the Senior Secured
Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is
applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes should not be purchased or held by any person
investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Senior Secured Note will be deemed to have given the
acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering
purchasing the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their
counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws
to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the
Senior Secured Notes.

###### LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SSN GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the_
_security interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the SSN Guarantees or Collateral are being_
_provided. It is a summary only and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all the limitations and_
_considerations, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or similar events could be initiated in any of_
_these jurisdictions as well as in any jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Senior_
_Secured Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes_
_over which jurisdiction’s law should apply to a given situation and could adversely affect your ability_
_to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN_
_Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Prospective investors in the Senior Secured_
_Notes should consult their own legal advisors in this respect. Also set forth below is a brief description_
_of certain aspects of insolvency law in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia,_
_Slovenia, Bulgaria and Greece._

**European Union**

The Guarantors in Luxembourg, Slovenia, Bulgaria and the Netherlands are organized under the laws
of Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of
May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “E.U. Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the
European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of
main interests” (which according to Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is “the place where
the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by
third parties”) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of
where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation the “centre of main interests” of a company
is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. This presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member
State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Furthermore, preamble 30 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut
this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than
that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes,
in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and
supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.” In that
assessment factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts
the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s
creditors are established may all be relevant. A company’s “centre of main interests” may change from
time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to
open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth
above) the registered office has been moved within the three-month period prior to the filing of the
insolvency petition.

The E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under
Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark)
have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company
has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to
mean a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period


-----

prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are
restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State.

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests
have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State
where the company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened
in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member
State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose
claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory
of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority
which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated,
has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening
the main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a
Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s center of main
interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another
Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain
limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any
preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that
other Member State where the company has assets.

**The Netherlands**

Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors which are incorporated under Dutch
law (the “Dutch Guarantors”) may be affected by (a) the standards of reasonableness and fairness
(maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and
unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden); and (c) the other general defenses available
to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Senior
Secured Notes. Other general defenses include claims that a security interest should be voided because
it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress
(bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include suspension of performance
(opschorting), dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). Furthermore, the courts of
the Netherlands may change the effects of a contractual obligation on the basis of abuse of authority
(misbruik van bevoegdheid). Moreover, enforcement of the SSN Guarantees or security interests may
be capable of being rescinded (vernietigd) as a result of lack of consensus ad idem (wilsgebreken) and
the legal consequences thereof. The above only applies to obligations of the Issuer and the Dutch
Guarantors that are governed by Dutch law.

The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors under the
Senior Secured Notes may be successfully contested by such Dutch company (or its administrator
(bewindvoerder) in suspension of payments (surseance van betaling) or its receiver (curator) in
bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the obligations of
the company do not fall within the scope of the objects clause as set out in the company’s articles of
association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company’s counterparty knew or ought to have known
(without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the objects and
purposes of such Dutch company, a court will consider (i) the text of the objects clause in the company’s
articles of association and (ii) all relevant circumstances including whether the granting of such security
interest is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit and
whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting of such security interest. The mere
fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in such Dutch company’s objects
clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires. In addition, it is relevant
whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such


-----

Dutch company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest.
It remains possible that even if a strong financial and commercial interdependence exists between
contracting parties, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee
or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant Dutch company’s objects or where it is
determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the relevant Dutch company
between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand.

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be
suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10%
or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal
value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association.
If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a
holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a
qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or
more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, other
entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or in an agreement with, the relevant
Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for
this purpose. The guarantee or security itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet
actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

To the extent Dutch law applies, any creditor of any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or
receiver) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor (or its
administrator or receiver) in connection with the Senior Secured Notes (which includes the issuance of
the Senior Secured Notes), under certain circumstances, if (i) any transaction or legal act entered into
by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Senior Secured Notes was conducted without
prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of
its/their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act
(irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions) and (iii) at the time
of any transaction or legal act entered into by any Issuer or Dutch Guarantor in connection with the
Senior Secured Notes was conducted, such Issuer and/or Dutch Guarantors and, unless the transactions
were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one
or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana).

A receiver in bankruptcy may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent
debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance
in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain
transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy.
This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the
obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing
obligations of the bankrupt which are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty
when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its
counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking
fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent
transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was
conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i)
the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had
been filed, or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and
the counterparty with a view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors.
Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged
and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Dutch Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such


-----

proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the
security of the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors.

**_Insolvency Laws_**

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law. Accordingly, where the Issuer
and the Dutch Guarantors have their “centre of main interests” or an “establishment in the Netherlands,”
they may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to
certain exceptions as provided for in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. In the event it was be determined
by the court that the Issuer or any of the Dutch Guarantors has its centre of main interest outside of the
EU, the Issuer or the relevant Dutch Guarantor may still be subjected to insolvency proceedings in the
Netherlands due to the fact that the EU Insolvency Regulation would not apply. In that event the Dutch
courts can claim jurisdiction based on the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) because the Dutch
Guarantor has its statutory seat in the Netherlands.

There are two applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations:(a)
suspension of payments, which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable
the debtor to continue as a going concern, and (b) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily
designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the most commonly
used insolvency regime and may result in the transfer of parts of the company as a going concern. A
suspension of payments almost always results in the debtor’s bankruptcy. Both insolvency regimes are
set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles of both insolvency
regimes is set out below.

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will
be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will
immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more
administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive
suspension of payments, but it will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one
quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one
third of the number of creditors of the

amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if
there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments
or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The fact
that the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices
that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims
within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of
a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months)
imposed by court order, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors.
During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset
subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a
suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such
creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting
bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain
circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the
application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general
meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude
the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het
_Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public_
interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated
and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’


-----

claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of
such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured
creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension of
payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement
of the security interest might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two
months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to Article
63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory
stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied
during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in
suspensions of payment; (b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security
interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and
distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (c) excess
proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset against an
unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors
are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy
proceedings against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors would allow secured creditors (and in case of
suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to
satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no
bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months,
extendable by another period of up to two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain
preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are
not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the
proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must
be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory
stay of execution of security rights and other rights as described above may be imposed. Further, a
receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable
period of time. If such time is not met, the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and
the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured
creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any
enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be off set against an unsecured claim
of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it
may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim
used for set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when
suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In
addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of
payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration
of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such
termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under
Dutch law, bankruptcy and suspension of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the
judgment of the bankruptcy or the suspension of payments.

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered
to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i)
approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the
creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and
conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently,
Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to
effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of


-----

payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments
or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

All unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency
proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions.
As a general rule, claims of unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be submitted to the
receiver in bankruptcy to be verified. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has
not been submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any
remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification” under Dutch law
means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting
purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured and non-preferential prebankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in
bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and
to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting).

In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims
will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount
and rank of the disputed claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed
claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover less
than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding.
The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed. Interest on
the Senior Secured Notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured
by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an
interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the
admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

Creditors of secured claims, such as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, and preferential creditors
with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against
the assets subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to
satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential
creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a
secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right
relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting
claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full,
the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of Parallel Debt obligations in favor of the
Security Agent. For any risks related to the Dutch law Parallel Debt structure, see “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—The security interests in_
_the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to you. The ability of the Security_
_Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt) obligations in favor of
the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the SSN Indenture (the Principal Obligations). The
Dutch law security interests are, and will be, granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel
Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the
same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the
Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interest
granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security
and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security except through the
Security Agent. As a result, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes bear some risks associated with a


-----

possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt concept has not
been tested under Dutch law and, to the extent that the security interests in the collateral created to
secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the
collateral. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in the Dutch
market.

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet
_homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”)_
on 1 January 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency
proceedings. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans is based on the UK
Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities
to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a
composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered
to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company
obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with
deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims
against the Dutch Guarantors being compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or
a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan under the Act on Court
Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not
incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on
Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the SSN Indenture and therefore the Senior Secured Notes.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan
is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the
claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of
the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a nonconsenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other
than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the
debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse
confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting
class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the
distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an
affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates
from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay
on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period,
_inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended,_
including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a
pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.

**Slovenia**

**_Certain Slovenian Companies and Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The granting of up-stream or cross-stream guarantees and security under Slovenian law is limited.

According to the Slovenian Companies Act (Zakon o gospodarskih družbah—ZGD 1—Companies Act),
as amended, joint stock companies are prohibited from providing funds to anyone for the purpose of
acquiring the companies’ shares and from guaranteeing or otherwise securing the repayment of such


-----

funds. While the statutory restrictions of financial assistance expressly refer only to joint stock
companies and the acquisition of their shares, it is possible that a court would also apply these rules to
the acquisition of shares of a direct or indirect parent of the relevant joint stock company or for limited
liability companies. Given the prohibition on financial assistance, it is not certain if a Slovenian joint
stock company may provide upstream or cross stream guarantees. Setting aside the financial assistance
prohibition, the amount of the guarantee should in any event not exceed whatever amounts the company
receives in consideration for providing the guarantee.

SSN Guarantees and other types of security granted by a company for purposes other than the
acquisition of its own shares are not covered by the financial assistance rules and instead must be
analyzed in light of the capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Act, which apply to limited
liability companies and joint stock companies. Such rules provide for (i) in respect of limited liability
companies a prohibition of making payments to the shareholder or making a legal transaction with a
similar legal effect (e.g. guarantee with its assets for any indebtedness of the shareholder) to the extent
that this would prevent preservation of the company’s (1) minimal lawfully allowed share capital
(najnižji znesek osnovnega kapitala) (being EUR 7,500), (2) actually registered share capital (osnovni
_kapital) and (3) tied up reserves (vezane rezerve), and (ii) in respect of joint stock companies a_
prohibition of return of equity (prepoved vračila vložkov) and a prohibition of concealed payment of
profit (prepoved prikritega izplačila dobička). Pursuant to these rules, a shareholder is generally only
entitled to participate in a company’s distributable profit but has no rights with respect to the company’s
assets except in the case of the winding up of the company. Thus, any payment by a company to a
shareholder, including any other transfer of economic benefits, that is not profit participation is
generally prohibited.

As the grant by a company of a guarantee or other type of security for the benefit of one of its
shareholders to secure an obligation of such shareholder towards a third-party or to secure the obligation
of another company forming part of the same group gives rise to a material benefit to the shareholder,
the grant of such guarantee or security is subject to the capital maintenance rules and thus permitted
only if certain legal requirements are met.

A limited liability company may not pay any portion of its share capital and tied up reserves to
shareholders, either directly or indirectly. This means that the grant of a guarantee or other security by
a company for the benefit of a shareholder is permitted only to the extent that the amount covered by
the guarantee or security does not endanger the company’s share capital and tied up reserves. To the
extent the amount in question does endanger the company’s share capital and tied up reserves, the
guarantee or other security is permitted only if the grant of the security is commercially justified based
on arm’s length principles. This is the case if the benefits to the company outweigh the risks involved
and the grant does not affect the company’s liquidity, e.g., if adequate security for the potential liability
is provided to the company or there are other benefits to the company. Under no circumstances,
however, must a company grant a guarantee or other type of security if doing so could reasonably be
expected to affect its liquidity or lead to its insolvency (e.g., because the beneficiary of the guarantee
has a particularly low degree of creditworthiness)—even if the company receives a monetary equivalent
from the shareholder, as in such case the grant of the guarantee or other security is never commercially
justified.

Similar rules apply in respect of a joint stock company, with the additional limitation that a joint stock
company is prohibited from any payment which would represent a return of equity or a concealed
payment of profit.

If a company grants a guarantee or other type of security to a shareholder in contravention of the capital
maintenance rules, the shareholder must pay-back the received benefit. If the shareholder was acting
bona fide, the repayment may only be requested if it is needed for repayment of a company’s debt to its
creditors. The liable shareholder may not be set free of its repayment obligations. The prescription
period for the repayment starts to lapse with the day when the unjustified payment was made.


-----

In addition, any violation of the capital maintenance or financial assistance rules exposes the directors
or managers of the Slovenian Guarantor to personal and criminal liability. In addition, the guarantee
could itself be held null and void.

**_Insolvency Law_**

For Slovenian law purposes, insolvency is (in summary) defined as a situation where a debtor is unable
to settle its obligations as they fall due for a certain period of time. Unless proven otherwise, a debtor
is deemed insolvent if:

- the debtor is more than two months late in paying one or more of its obligations that together
exceed 20% of all of its obligations, as shown in the debtor’s latest published annual report; or

- the monies standing to the credit of the debtor’s bank account are not sufficient to pay the whole
amount enforceable under a writ of execution (sklep o izvršbi) or to pay the enforcement draft
(izvršnica), and such status continues for 60 consecutive days or for more than 60 days within
a period of 90 days, and still exists on the day preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition;
or

- the debtor does not have an account with a payment services provider in Slovenia and in the 60
days following the finality of the writ of execution has not settled its obligations deriving
therefrom, or

- after the final confirmation of a compulsory settlement or simplified compulsory settlement
over the debtor, if the debtor is more than two months late with the payment of its obligations
under the (simplified) compulsory settlement or with the payment of obligations towards
secured creditors that arose before the (simplified) compulsory settlement proceedings
commenced or with any other financial restructuring measures stipulated in the financial
restructuring plan; or

- the value of the debtor’s obligations exceeds the value of its assets; or

- the debtor’s current year loss together with any loss brought forward from previous years is
equal to, or greater than, half of its subscribed capital, and that loss cannot be covered by the
profit brought forward or reserves.

Further, the debtor is deemed insolvent (and is not allowed to prove otherwise) if it is over two months
late in paying its employees their salaries up to the amount of minimum salaries or taxes and
contributions that are paid together with salaries, and that delay still exists on the day preceding
submission of a petition for the filing of the insolvency petition. Additionally, it is possible that certain
Slovenian laws regulating intervention measures in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic include
additional non-rebuttable presumptions of insolvency. For instance, until September 30, 2020, a debtor
was also deemed insolvent (without the option to prove otherwise) if it was late in paying the salaries
and salary related contributions for more than one month from the day it received certain
reimbursements based on the intervention measures adopted with the aim of retaining employment in
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under Slovenian law, the following types of insolvency proceedings may be opened against a company
having its centre of main interest in Slovenia within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation:

- bankruptcy proceeding (stečaj). The opening of these types of proceedings may be requested
by the company, any personally liable shareholder of the company, any of its creditors, or the
Public Guarantee and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (this fund provides
protection of rights of those workers whose employment was terminated due to employer
insolvency). During bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company is administered by a
bankruptcy administrator.


-----

- compulsory settlement proceeding (prisilna poravnava). The opening of these types of
proceedings may be requested by the company, a personally liable shareholder of the company
or by creditors of the company whose combined financial claims amount to more than 20 per
cent of the company’s financial obligations. The purpose of the compulsory settlement
procedure is to enable a debtor that became insolvent to financially restructure, providing for
its liquidity and solvency, and to ensure the creditors receive more favorable payment
conditions for their claims than in the case of bankruptcy proceedings.

- simplified compulsory settlement proceeding (poenostavljena prisilna poravnava). Simplified
compulsory settlement proceedings are permitted, if the debtor is a micro sized company (as
specified in the Slovenian Companies Act based on the following criteria: the average number
of employees in a business year, the net proceeds from sales and the value of the assets) or a
sole proprietor who meets the criteria stated in the Slovenian Companies Act for micro or a
small sized companies. The opening of these types of proceedings may be requested only by
the debtor (company/sole proprietor) or a personally liable shareholder of the company.

In the event that a company is at risk of becoming insolvent within one year, a company (other than a
micro sized company) may restructure its financial liabilities in so called preventive restructuring
proceedings (postopek preventivnega prestrukturiranja) in order to reduce the risk of insolvency.
Preventive restructuring proceedings are not considered to be insolvency proceedings in the technical
sense. This is because they enable a company to take financial restructuring measures in order to avoid
becoming insolvent by entering into an agreement for a financial restructuring with its creditors.

In relation to secondary proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation, if an entity
has an establishment in Slovenia, the only insolvency proceedings that may be opened are bankruptcy
proceedings (stečaj).

In the event of a liquidation of a Slovenian Guarantor following bankruptcy, the liability of the
Slovenian Guarantor in respect to the Senior Secured Notes will only rank after the cost of the
liquidation proceedings (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any debts
of the relevant entity that enjoy a more senior or preferential status under the Slovenian law. Preferential
debts may include, among others:

- remuneration owed to employees for the last six months preceding the insolvency proceeding;

- compensation (damages) for work related accidents and occupational diseases;

- redundancy payments for workers dismissed prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings; and

- taxes and social security contributions related to the remuneration (for the period of the last six
months) and redundancy payments as well as social security contributions for a period prior to
the opening of the insolvency proceeding.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for distribution
to unsecured and un preferred creditors, unless a surplus is realized.

Certain legal actions of a debtor in an insolvency procedure can be challenged in court if they were
concluded or carried out during the twelve month period prior to the submission of a petition for
beginning of the insolvency procedure.

A legal action of an insolvent debtor may be challenged if such action results in either a decrease in the
net value of assets of the debtor, so that the pool of assets available to other creditors is reduced, or a
person for the benefit of whom the act has been executed, having obtained more favorable payment
conditions for a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy, and a person for the benefit of which the act


-----

was executed, at the time when such act was executed, was aware of, or should have been aware of, the
fact that the debtor was insolvent.

If the other person did not provide any exchange (consideration) or if the value of such exchange was
small, such legal action can be challenged if it was concluded during a period of 36 months prior to the
filing of the motion for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and even if the other person was
not aware of or did not need to be aware of the fact that the debtor was insolvent.

Challenging of legal actions is also available under general rules of Slovenian civil law (i.e. also outside
insolvency).

In general, the opening of insolvency proceedings by a Slovenian court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts; however the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain
contracts as to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company. Any power of attorney
terminates upon initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.

Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on the relevant Slovenian
Guarantor’s business and assets and the Slovenian Guarantor’s respective obligations with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Certain Slovenian Collateral Law Considerations_**

According to the Slovenian Private International Law and Procedure Act and the Regulation (EC) No
593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to
contractual obligations (Rome I), Slovenian courts will apply the lex rei sitae, which is the law of the
place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest are situated.

Therefore, the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets such as registered
shares in Slovenian companies, tangible assets located in Slovenia, receivables/claims governed by
Slovenian law and having debtors located in Slovenia, bank accounts held in Slovenia, etc. will be
subject to Slovenian law.

Under Slovenian law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than
the creditor of the claim that is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence,
the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt) obligations in
favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the SSN Indenture (the Principal
Obligations). The Slovenian law security interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security for
the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all
times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the
security interest granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not
have direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security
except through the Security Agent.

In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under Slovenian law and, to the extent that
the security interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interests in the collateral.

**_Enforcement Proceedings_**

Under Slovenian law, depending on the type of security certain perfection requirements must be
satisfied in order for a security to become enforceable against third parties. If these perfection
requirements are not satisfied a holder of security interest may experience difficulties enforcing its


-----

rights with respect to the collateral against third parties, including administrators in insolvency
proceedings or other creditors that claim a security interest in the same collateral.

- In the case of a pledge over the shares of a limited liability company, the agreement must be
drawn up in the form of a notarial deed and registration of the security interest in the court
register of the relevant Slovenian company is required. If a secured claim is not settled at
maturity, the shares may be sold through (i) a court enforced sale or (ii) an out of court sale. If
the security agreement is concluded between commercial entities, it is presumed that the parties
agreed on an out of court sale; in all other cases, the parties must conclude an agreement on an
out of court sale in writing.

- In case of a pledge over the shares of a joint stock company, the security interest must be entered
in the central register maintained by the KDD (Slovene Central Securities Clearing
Corporation).

- In case of a pledge over receivables, the pledgor must notify the debtor of the pledged
receivable. Upon receipt of the notification, the debtor of the pledged receivable may only
validly pay to the pledgee and the pledgee is not required to initiate a procedure against the
pledgor, but can demand and enforce the payment directly against the debtor of the pledged
receivable. In case of a pecuniary claim, the creditor must, at the request of the pledgor, deposit
the collected amount with the court.

Court enforcement proceedings are regulated by the Slovenian Enforcement and Securing of Civil
Claims Act (Zakon o izvršbi in zavarovanju—ZIZ—Enforcement Act). According to the Enforcement
Act, enforcement procedures may be commenced only upon obtaining a valid enforcement title which
may be in the form of either (i) an enforceable court decision, (ii) a court settlement, (iii) an enforceable
notarial deed, or (iv) another enforceable decision or instrument that is an enforceable title according to
the law, a ratified and published international treaty or a legal act of the European Union that is directly
applicable in the Republic of Slovenia. Therefore, if an agreement is drawn up in the form of a directly
enforceable notarial deed (with all documents and attachments in certified Slovenian translations), the
enforcement procedure may be commenced without any further litigation.

The enforcement procedure starts with the creditor filing a proposal for enforcement. In this proposal,
the creditor must provide information about the legal title upon which the enforcement is based, the
debtor’s obligation, the enforcement measure or the relevant debtor’s assets that are targeted by the
procedure (objects of enforcement). There is no deadline for the court to decide on the enforcement
proposal. In practice, in most cases the court reaches a decision within about two weeks. As long as
there is a valid enforcement title, courts will generally grant the enforcement. The debtor and any thirdparty with a right to the object of enforcement that prevents enforcement may file an objection against
a decision granting enforcement.

Any costs associated with an enforcement procedure (court fees, bailiff fees, etc.) are initially borne by
the person filing a proposal for enforcement, however, after the sale of a security interest, any
distribution proceeds are first used to reimburse the costs and expenses of the enforcement procedure.

The Enforcement Act regulates in detail the enforcement procedures with respect to different types of
assets (e.g., enforcement over real estate, receivables, movables and similar) as well as the procedures
with respect to different types of claims (e.g., monetary claims, claims regarding the handing over of a
real estate or movables and similar).

The means of enforcement of monetary claims under the Enforcement Act are:

- enforcement by seizing movables, appraisal of their value, sale of the movables and repayment
of a creditor from the money acquired through the sale of the movables;


-----

- enforcement by seizing a monetary claim of a debtor and transferring the monetary claim to a
creditor;

- enforcement by blocking a debtor’s assets on bank accounts and transferring the blocked assets
to a creditor after the required conditions are met;

- enforcement by seizing a debtor’s claim to have certain (im)movables handed over to it,
transferring this claim to the creditor and sale of the object;

- enforcement by seizing and monetizing other assets or material rights of a debtor (e.g., a patent,
right to usage and similar);

- enforcement over securities;

- enforcement over business shares by registering enforcement in the business registry and selling
the business shares; and

- enforcement over real estate with a registration of the enforcement into the real estate register,
appraisal of the value of the real estate, sale of the real estate and repayment of a creditor from
the money acquired through the sale of the real estate.

Certain assets of the debtor may not be subject of enforcement, whereby generally such limitations do
not apply, among others, to enforcement of claims secured with a pledge over such assets.

When enforcement is pursued out of court (when so allowed by the law, and, if so required, agreed
contractually):

- a share in a limited liability company or the shares in a joint stock company can generally only
be sold in a public auction (whereby certain Slovenian legal scholars argue that any kind of
invitation made to the public to purchase or provide bids is sufficient). Exceptionally, a direct
sale (i.e. without a public auction) is allowed if the shares (of a joint stock company) have a
stock exchange price. The auction or the direct sale (as applicable) can be performed after an 8
day prior notice to the debtor of the secured claim and to the pledgor (if not the same person).
The pledgee must timely notify both the debtor of the secured claim and the pledgor of the date
and place of the sale. Any surplus of the proceeds over the secured claim must be delivered to
the pledgee;

- enforcement over a pledged receivable is performed by collection of the receivable from the
debtor or, in case of bankruptcy or compulsory settlement, by reporting the right to separate
repayment in the respective proceedings and repayment in the context of such proceedings; and

- blank signed bills of exchange can be enforced by due completion of the blank places and
submission for payment from the respective bank account of their issuer.

**Serbia**

**_Insolvency Law_**

Under the Serbian Insolvency Law, insolvency proceedings can (but do not have to) be opened if at
least one of the following conditions is met:

- Actual insolvency. The debtor is unable to pay its debts within 45 days from their due date or
has completely ceased all payments for a consecutive period of 30 days; permanent insolvency
is presumed if the petition for the opening of insolvency procedures is filed by a creditor who
was unable to obtain satisfaction of his monetary claims by any of the means of enforcement in
a judicial or tax enforcement proceeding in Serbia.


-----

- Pending (threatening) insolvency. The debtor is able to prove that he will likely not be able to
pay its existing debts as they become due.

- Over indebtedness. The liabilities of the debtor exceed its assets.

- Failure to comply with the adopted reorganization plan or if the reorganization plan was put
into effect in a fraudulent or unlawful manner.

The opening of insolvency proceedings (stečaj) may be requested by any of the debtor’s creditors, the
debtor itself or the debtor’s liquidation administrator. During the insolvency proceedings, the estate
(assets) of the insolvency debtor, and the debts, are administered by the insolvency administrator.

The insolvency proceedings may be conducted as bankruptcy proceedings or as reorganization
proceedings. In bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are satisfied through the sale of the debtor’s assets,
or the sale of the debtor as a legal entity. In reorganization proceedings, creditors are satisfied by
redefinition of their relations (haircut and/or reprogram) with the debtor or in another manner provided
for in the plan. There are two types of procedures for adoption of a reorganization plan (i.e. two types
of reorganization): (i) regular procedure, after the formal opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii)
prepacked reorganization (i.e., reorganization on the basis of a prepacked reorganization plan submitted
by the insolvency debtor jointly with the proposal for initiation of insolvency proceeding (provided any
of the grounds for the opening of insolvency proceeding exist)). Although the two types of
reorganizations are similar, the main difference is, besides the timing of the submission of a draft
reorganization plan, in that the prepacked reorganization plan includes, inter alia, signed non-binding
statements of the majority of creditors per value of their claims from each class specified in the plan,
that they agree with the contents of the proposed prepacked reorganization plan and are willing to vote
for its adoption. Another important difference between these reorganizations is in that if a prepacked
reorganization plan is not adopted, the insolvency proceedings terminate, while if a reorganization plan
is not adopted in the pending insolvency proceedings, the proceedings continue as bankruptcy. A
prepacked reorganization may be initiated only by the debtor, while a reorganization plan in a regular
procedure may be submitted by: (i) the insolvency administrator; (ii) any secured creditor; (iii) any
insolvency creditor; and (iv) shareholders holding at least 30% of the debtor’s issued share capital.

The claims are satisfied in the following order:

- expenses associated with the insolvency proceedings, which are settled from the insolvency
estate as a matter of priority;

- any obligations incurred by the insolvency estate; and

- the claims of insolvency creditors, which are satisfied according to their rank. Insolvency claims
are ranked as follows:

- first-ranking claims comprise (i) unpaid net salaries of employees and former employees in the
amount of a yearly minimum wage for the year prior to the opening of insolvency together with
interest from the due date to the date of the opening of insolvency; (ii) unpaid contributions for
mandatory pension and disability insurance for two years prior to the opening of insolvency
and (iii) claims arising from contracts with companies the subject of which are unpaid
contributions for mandatory pension and disability insurances for two years before the opening
of insolvency (the basis for the calculation of the contributions under (ii) and (iii) is the
minimum monthly social security contributions basis as at the date of opening of insolvency
proceedings);

- second ranking claims comprise all public revenue claims that have become due over the last
three-months prior to the opening of insolvency, except mandatory pension and disability
insurance contributions for employees;


-----

- third ranking claims comprise claims of other insolvency creditors (unsecured claims); and

- fourth ranking claims comprise claims that arose within two years before the opening of the
insolvency proceedings under or in connection with loans or other economically equivalent
transactions to the extent such loans or equivalent transactions are unsecured and were granted
by an affiliate of the debtor who is not regularly engaged in the business of providing credits
and loans.

Claims of creditors which have, prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractually agreed to
subordination will be settled only after the settlement in full of the third ranking claims with
accompanying interest(s).

Assets over which security interests have been granted are generally not available for distribution to
unsecured and non-preferred creditors, unless a surplus is realized from the sale of such assets. The
following three types of creditors are not considered to be insolvency creditors:

- secured creditors (razlučni poverioci), i.e., creditors who have a pledge right (založno pravo),
statutory retention right, or a right of settlement on the assets or rights recorded in public
records. They are entitled to primary settlement from the proceeds of the sale of the assets or
the collection of claims over which that right has been granted. If a secured creditor’s claim
exceeds such proceeds, the secured creditor is an insolvency creditor with respect to the
remaining portion of its claim. Secured claims acquired through enforcement proceedings or
creating of a charge within 60 days before the date of opening the insolvency proceedings for
the purpose of enforcement or security shall cease to be valid; such creditors shall not be
deemed secured creditors.

- pledge creditors (založni poverioci), i.e., persons who have a pledge over property or rights of
the debtor that is recorded in the public records, but do not have a monetary claim (secured by
such pledge) against the debtor (i.e., the monetary claim secured by that pledge is a claim of a
third-party), must inform the court about the pledge within a specified deadline and provide
evidence of the existence of the relevant pledge together with a statement of the amount of the
secured monetary claim against third-party (as of the date of the opening of the insolvency
proceedings). Pledge creditors may not vote for, nor be voted as, members of an insolvency
creditors’ assembly or an insolvency creditors’ committee; and

- separation creditors, i.e., persons who on the basis of their property rights or personal rights,
have the right to request a certain asset to be excluded from the insolvency estate. Separation
creditors are not insolvency creditors. However, in a case where the bankruptcy debtor has
transferred these assets in the course of insolvency proceedings without being authorized to do
so, a separation creditor has the right to request satisfaction of its claim in an amount equal to
the market value of the asset plus compensation of damage, and such request is to be settled as
a liability of the insolvency estate (in priority over claims of insolvency creditors).

Legal transactions and other actions entered into or taken before the opening of the insolvency
proceedings that interfere with the principle of the equal settlement of insolvency creditors or are
damaging the creditors, as well as transactions and actions putting some creditors in a more favorable
position over other creditors (“favoring creditors”) may be contested by the insolvency administrator or
by other creditors:

- Any action providing security or settlement to a creditor in a manner and at a time that
corresponds to the substance of such creditor’s right (“regular settlement”) taken within six
months before the filing of a petition for initiation of insolvency proceedings may be contested
if the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transaction, and the creditor knew or should have
known of its insolvency. Regular settlements after the filing of the petition to open insolvency
proceedings may also be contested if the creditor knew or should have known that the debtor


-----

was insolvent or if the creditor knew that the petition to initiate insolvency proceedings has
been filed.

- Any action benefiting one creditor which he was not entitled to request, or was entitled to
request but not in the manner as, and at the time when, it was provided, may be contested if it
was carried out within twelve months before filing the petition to open insolvency.

Any action directly damaging the debtor’s creditors may be contested if:

- it was entered into within six months before filing for insolvency, if the insolvency debtor was
insolvent at the time and the counterpart knew of its insolvency;

- the transaction was concluded after the filing of the petition aimed at initiating insolvency
proceedings, if the insolvency debtor’s counterpart knew or should have known that the
insolvency debtor was insolvent or that the filing for the opening the insolvency had been made;
and

- the debtor’s action results in a waiver of some of its rights or if the failure of the debtor to act
results in its inability to exercise that right and the action was taken or omitted within the last
six months before the filing of the petition to open the insolvency proceeding.

Any transaction entered into or taken within five years before the filing of the petition for initiation of
insolvency proceedings or after that, with the intent to damage one or more creditors, may be contested
if the insolvent debtor’s counterpart knew of the insolvent debtor’s intent. Knowledge of the debtor’s
intent is presumed if the insolvent debtor’s counterpart knew that there was a threat of the insolvent
debtor’s insolvency and that the action would damage the insolvency creditors or that the debtor has
received no value or no adequate value as a consideration for performance of its obligation.

In addition, any security the debtor granted under a loan (or under any other legal action that, in
economic terms, corresponds to a loan) to an affiliate, provided that such affiliate is not regularly
engaged in the business of granting credits or loans, at a time when the debtor was permanently
insolvent, or within one year prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings, has no legal effect in the
insolvency proceedings. Also, if a debtor has repaid a credit or a loan in the year immediately preceding
the opening of insolvency proceedings to an affiliated person which is not regularly engaged in the
business of granting credits or loans, the debtor is deemed to have deliberately jeopardized creditors
and such repayment may be contested as an intentional damaging of creditors.

The court order on the opening of insolvency proceedings has certain consequences. For example,
insolvency creditors may satisfy their claims against the debtor only in insolvency proceedings. Undue
claims against the insolvency debtor are deemed due as of the date of opening of the insolvency. All
judicial proceedings against the insolvent debtor and its assets and all administrative proceedings
initiated at the request of the insolvent debtor and the administrative and tax proceedings aimed at
establishing a pecuniary obligation on the insolvent debtor are suspended and resume only after the
fulfillment of certain conditions. No enforcement proceedings may be conducted against the debtor or
its assets for the purpose of settling the claims, except for the enforcement of liabilities of the insolvency
estate and expenses of the insolvency proceedings. Enforcement ban can be temporarily lifted for a
period of nine months in favor of secured creditors in certain cases, in order to allow them to enforce
their claims through the sale of the collateral. The initiation of insolvency proceedings does not result
in automatic termination of contracts; but the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain
executory contracts to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company.

**_Creation, Perfection, Amendment and Enforcement of Pledge on Ownership Stakes in Limited_**
**_Liability Company_**

The Secured Transactions Act provides that a pledgee shall acquire the right of pledge by registration
in the Pledge Registry (Registar založnog prava) kept with the Serbian Agency for Commercial


-----

Registers (Agencija za privredne registre) (the “Pledge Registry”). Registration is performed on the
basis of a (Stakes) Pledge Agreement. The (Stakes) Pledge Agreements must be made in writing. In
case of pledge over stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company), the (Stakes) Pledge Agreement
also has to be notarized by a notary public.

Material amendments to the obligation secured by the (stake) pledge (e.g., legal basis, principal amount,
term, interest rate) require amendments to and registration with the competent authorities of a security
document (e.g., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement). Under the Secured Transactions Act, any amendment to
a security document (e.g., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement) which would alter essential elements of the
relevant collateral would affect such collateral, i.e., it would be considered as new collateral and
therefore would have the priority as of the day of inscription of such alteration in the Pledge Registry
(thus giving rise to a new hardening period), and ranking lower than the collateral registered before the
amendments. There is no consistency in the practice of the Serbian courts or the Pledge Registry as to
which elements of the security documents should be considered essential elements, but these are
generally considered to include the legal basis, principal amount, term and interest rate.

Enforcement proceedings may be commenced in court or, if so expressly provided for in the pledge
agreement (i.e., (Stakes) Pledge Agreement), out of court (in accordance with the terms and conditions
imposed by the law). In case of judicial enforcement, the enforcement title is the relevant excerpt from
the competent Pledge Registry and the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company) can be sold via
public auction (direct sale is possible only if the collateral has a current market price, in the case of
multiple failure of auction sale or in case the enforcement debtor and enforcement creditor agree so).
When enforcement is pursued out of court (when this is permitted by the pledge agreement), the title
for enforcement is the relevant excerpt from the Pledge Registry, the stakes can be sold at public auction
and in direct sale only if its current market price can be established (unlikely to be the case with the
stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company). If the collateral does not have a current market price
(as the stakes (i.e., share(s) in limited liability company)), the pledgee can sell it in a manner a
reasonable and careful man taking care of the interests of the debtor (and the pledgor, if not the same
party as the debtor) would employ.

**Bosnia and Herzegovina**

Telemach BH is a company organized in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“FBiH”), which
is one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Accordingly, the following discussion is limited
to the relevant laws and regulations applicable in FBiH.

Pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Act of FBiH (“FBiH FX Act”), cross border payments from and to
FBiH are permitted if made in accordance with that law. The FBiH FX Act and related bylaws refer
only to the guarantees and security that a Bosnian resident grants for the debt of a non-resident to another
non-resident only if granted under a so-called “credit transaction.” Credit transactions between residents
and non-residents, according to the FBiH FX Act, comprise credits and loans, whereas “credit
transactions” between non- residents are not specified or separately defined. Transactions with debt and
equity securities are a separate category under the FBiH FX Act. It is unlikely that the narrow definition
of cross-border guarantees/security under the FBiH FX Act would be interpreted by the competent FBiH
authority to mean that guarantee/ security in support of foreign debt originating under bonds could be
regarded as prohibited or as contrary to public policy of FBiH, because the FBiH FX Act allows granting
of guarantees/security in economically equivalent situations (loans between non-residents).
Nonetheless, the issue has not been formally clarified by the competent FBiH authority.

Any guarantee or other security granted by a FBiH resident in favor of a non-resident must be registered
with the Ministry of Finance of FBiH. The registration application must be made (i) within 15-days
from the decision on the issuance of the guarantee is passed by the relevant body of the guarantor if the
underlying transaction is concluded between two non-resident entities, or (ii) within 15-days from the
date of execution of the underlying transaction documents if concluded between a resident and a nonresident entity.


-----

If the underlying transaction is concluded between two non-residents, periodic reports on the status of
the guarantee must be provided to the Ministry of Finance of FBiH.

In addition, any company based in FBiH that issues a guarantee or provides other security to a nonresident must obtain from non-resident a security instrument that hedges the risk of the guarantee being
called. The FBiH FX Act does not contain any further details regarding such a security instrument.
Nonetheless, the counter-guarantee instrument is scrutinized by the Ministry of Finance of FBiH, which
typically requests presentation of a proof of a liquid security instrument and employs wide discretion
when assessing and approving counter-guarantees. The Ministry’s restrictive practice is continually
evolving, and varies on a case- by-case basis. Pursuant to article 7(2) of the FBiH FX Act, a commercial
bank is prohibited to perform a payment order and from wiring funds abroad if such payment or transfer
is in violation of the law, subject to administrative fines. In this context, there is a theoretical risk that a
local bank might reject making relevant payments outside Bosnia and Herzegovina without proof that
the cross-border guarantee has been approved by the Ministry of Finance of FBiH.

**_Limitations Related to Financial Assistance and Corporate Benefit Rules_**

Certain corporate law limitations stem from the general prohibitions on financial assistance and capital
maintenance rules under the Companies Act of FBiH. According to the Companies Act of FBiH, a
limited liability company is prohibited from giving loans or providing securities/guarantees for the
acquisition of its own shares.

The scope of this prohibition of financial assistance is not entirely clear when it comes to its application
to the company’s indirect shareholders or to the acquisition of shares of one the company’s direct or
indirect shareholders. There are no precedents and therefore some risk remains that the courts could
adopt an extensive interpretation of the provision.

There is no explicit corporate benefit rule in the context of granting security for the obligations of third
parties. However, under the general rules of the Companies Act of FBiH, the management is obliged to
act in the company’s best interest and is liable for damages to the company and the shareholders in case
of a breach of this duty.

Upstream or cross stream guarantee/security may be potentially open to a challenge by way of an actio
_pauliana. The rules on action pauliana, found in the Obligations Act, provide that a creditor having a_
due claim may file a lawsuit for avoidance of a transaction undertaken by its debtor, as far as the effects
of that transaction on the creditor are concerned, if the transaction is deemed to be to the detriment of
the challenging creditor, i.e. if as a result of such a transaction the debtor does not have enough assets
to satisfy the creditor’s claim. The court practice concerning the foregoing in the context of third-party
guarantees/security and corporate benefit, capital maintenance and financial assistance concepts is
undeveloped in FBiH.

Theoretically, a third-party guarantee/security given for no consideration can also be challenged for
lack of causa (commercial reason underlying the transaction).

**_Other Noteworthy Procedural Points Regarding Guarantees/Securities_**

To secure priority for a pledge and its judicial enforcement, a registration with the Pledges Registry,
which is maintained by the Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina, should be performed based
on a written pledge agreement.

In addition, it should be noted that the Parallel Debt concept has not been tested under the laws of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Theoretically, the concept can be challenged as simulated contract or for lack
of causa. However, a more compelling argument seems to be that if a Parallel Debt concept is
enforceable under the law governing the financing documentation, there is no public policy norm of
FBiH law that should be able to override this.


-----

In Bosnia and Herzegovina there is no comparable structure to the common law trust, due to the
principle of accessority where a security may only be validly created in favour of the creditor(s) holding
the secured claims The issue is typically solved through the appointment of a security agent, acting as
a joint and several creditor (solidarni povjerilac) of each and every obligation of the borrower towards
each creditor and/or by employing a Parallel Debt concept. However, the respective structures have not
yet been tested before Bosnia and Herzegovina courts, although they are commonly used in cross-border
financings.

_Pledge Registry Software Platform Deficiencies_

The software of the Pledge Registry does not technically enable pledge registration with the pledgor
being a foreign (i.e., non-Bosnian) entity. The web platform for pledge registration technically allows
only a Bosnian domiciled pledgor to be recorded. The perfection (i.e., registration) of a share pledge
over a Bosnian company’s shares by a non-resident shareholder is therefore practically unavailable and
may only be effected with the intentional incorrect inscription of the country of origin of the pledgor
(i.e., only by selecting the item “Bosnia and Herzegovina” from the dropdown menu). In practice the
parties often opt to conclude the share pledge agreement in a form of notarial deed (notarski obrađena
_isprava) that constitutes an enforceable instrument (izvršna isprava). Even so, execution of the share_
pledge agreement in the form of a notarial deed does not constitute the pledge over the shares of the
company, but only a pledge in respect of the enforceable deed. In an insolvency scenario, this would
mean that such a creditor would not qualify as a secured creditor (razlučni povjerilac).

**_Enforcement Proceedings_**

Enforcement proceedings are regulated by the Enforcement Proceedings Act of FBiH.

According to the Enforcement Proceedings Act, enforcement procedures over property in Bosnia and
Herzegovina may be commenced only upon obtaining a valid enforcement title which may be, inter
_alia, in the form of a notarized agreement. A certificate of registration of the pledge issued by the Pledge_
Registry is deemed to be an enforcement title, as well.

**_Overview of the Procedure_**

The procedure starts with a creditor filing an enforcement motion. The enforcement motion must
include information about the enforcement title and the relevant debtor’s assets that are targeted by the
procedure. Upon filing the enforcement motion the court has eight days to decide on the motion;
however, in practice this deadline is usually extended. If the court considers the motion admissible and
justified, it will grant allow enforcement on the basis of a decision on enforcement. The enforcement
creditor and the enforcement debtor may object to the court’s decision within eight days from its receipt.
If one of the parties files an objection, the other party has three days to submit its response.

Upon receipt of the response or the expiration of the three-day period without a response being
submitted, the court may decide on the matter or schedule a hearing. The court decides whether the
objection is granted or denied or whether it is refused as untimely, incomplete or inadmissible. If the
court accepts the objection it dismisses the enforcement completely or partially and revokes the
enforcement actions that have previously been conducted. The parties have a right to appeal the court’s
decision on the objection within eight days from its receipt, under certain circumstances enumerated in
the law. Objections and appeals do not suspend the enforcement proceedings, however, the settlement
of debt, if pending, is postponed until the court decides on the objection except when enforcement is on
debtor’s transactional bank accounts which may continue.

**_Costs of the Procedure_**

According to the Enforcement Proceedings Act, a creditor who applies for enforcement must pay the
estimated costs required for the enforcement proceedings in advance and do so within a certain period
determined by the court. The court will suspend the enforcement proceedings if the costs are not paid


-----

within that period. If an enforcement act depends on the costs being paid in advance and the payment
is not made before that date, the relevant enforcement act may not be carried out. The enforcement
debtor must compensate the creditor for the costs incurred by it that are necessary to carry out the
enforcement and the enforcement creditor must compensate the debtor for any costs it has caused
unnecessarily.

**_Enforcement Procedures in Relation to Pledges_**

Enforcement of pledge pursuant to Framework Pledge Act of BiH is initiated by the pledgee upon a
breach of the pledge agreement by the pledgor. The pledgee must present the pledge contract and the
certificate of registration to the competent court. The certificate of registration is the enforcement title,
provided that the contents of the registration fully correspond to the contents of the pledge agreement.
Upon filing the enforcement motion the court has eight days to decide on the motion. In its enforcement
motion the creditor may request either that the court bailiff takes the collateral from the pledgee and
sells it or that the court bailiff seizes the security from the debtor and sells it. If the creditor submits a
motion proposing the latter, the court bailiff is required to seize the collateral within eight days from
the issuance of the court’s decision and then to sell it.

**_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations_**

As of July 2021, the new Insolvency Act provides for a pre-insolvency restructuring process called
“pre- insolvency procedure” (predstečajni postupak). This pre-insolvency currently exists in addition
to the traditional restructuring process and as a part of the insolvency procedure, and similarly to the
insolvency procedure, its main steps must be sanctioned by a court. The pre-insolvency procedure under
the Insolvency Act may be applied when there is a “threatening illiquidity” (prijeteća platežna
_nesposobnost), but where the debtor is still not insolvent. The threatening illiquidity is defined as a_
forecast that the debtor will not be able to satisfy its debt in accordance with its due repayment plan in
the following 12 months or if the debtor is in a 60-days default with respect to the fulfillment of its
monetary obligations. The debtor or the creditor (with the debtor’s consent) can file an application for
the initiation of insolvency proceedings on this ground.

Additionally, there are two main reasons for initiating insolvency proceedings—insolvency and
threatened insolvency. In general, a debtor is insolvent if (a) it is unable to settle its due obligations for
a period of 60 consecutive days, or (b) its bank accounts are blocked for a period of 60 consecutive
days.

Insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a written petition of an authorized person. Authorized persons
include the debtor and all creditors who have a legally recognized interest in the conduct of the
proceedings. The creditor is required to demonstrate, by attaching appropriate documentation, that its
claim and the inability of the debtor to make payments is probable. Only the insolvency debtor is entitled
to initiate insolvency proceedings due to threatened insolvency.

Insolvency proceedings are generally conducted in two phases, a preliminary phase and the insolvency
proceedings themselves. The preliminary procedure is conducted by the insolvency court, which can
also appoint an interim insolvency administrator. The main purpose of the preliminary procedure is to
determine in principle whether the conditions for the opening insolvency are satisfied, i.e. whether any
of the insolvency grounds exist, whether there is a sufficient basis for the petition, whether there are
sufficient funds to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings and whether the current operations can
be maintained and continued without detriment to the debtor, potential insolvency estate and/or
creditors. The insolvency proceedings, once opened, are conducted by the insolvency administrator
appointed by the court and insolvency judge. An alternative to these two-step proceedings is direct
bankruptcy, in cases where (i) a petition is filed by the company’s liquidator or (ii) a creditor files an
insolvency petition supported by a final and binding decision on enforcement that is not satisfied for a
period of at least 90 days.


-----

The general effects of the opening of insolvency proceedings include a stay of pending court and arbitral
proceedings involving the insolvency estate, and pro rata satisfaction of creditors upon sale of the
debtor’s assets by the administrator, in accordance with their payment ranks. Creditors with a separate
satisfaction right (mortgagees, pledgees, creditors to which the debtor transferred rights as security,
creditors with retention rights) have payment priority in insolvency proceedings and have the right to
separate settlement from the proceeds of the asset serving as collateral.

Only the insolvency administrator is authorized to dispose of the debtor’s assets and any disposal by
the insolvency debtor is without legal effect, except in the case of disposals to which general rules of
legitimate reliance on land registers or other appropriate public registers apply.

As of the date of the opening of insolvency proceedings, all bank accounts are closed and the insolvency
administrator opens a new bank account onto which all insolvency debtor’s funds from the closed
accounts are transferred. There is no provision ensuring that the pledge on closed bank accounts
transfers onto the new bank account.

Guarantees and other security for third-party debt provided within a certain period preceding the
opening of the insolvency proceedings may be challenged if they can be considered as giving preference
to certain creditors, as follows:

- guarantees and security given within the period of 12 months prior to the submission of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at that time the debtor was insolvent or
the creditor knew of such insolvency or did not know due to gross negligence;

- guarantees and security given after the submission of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings if the creditor knew of the debtor’s insolvency or the motion for the opening of the
insolvency proceedings at the time or did not know due to gross negligence;

- guarantees and security given in the 90-days preceding the petition or after the submission
thereof; and

- guarantees and security given within the six months preceding the petition for the opening of
the insolvency proceedings if the debtor was insolvent at such time.

If the creditor is a related party, the awareness of the debtor’s insolvency is presumed. In addition, loans
granted in substitution to capital contributions are subordinated to all other claims during the insolvency
proceedings. Capital replacing loans are defined as loans that are granted at a critical time for the
company, when the company’s shareholders could have been reasonably expected to contribute capital
to the company, rather than grant loans. This also includes other legally binding transactions that are
economically equivalent to loan.

Granting of security for the claim of a company’s shareholder for repayment of a loan (or an equivalent
thereof) given at the time when capital contribution should have been provided is voidable if the
transaction took place within five years immediately preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings
or after the petition.

A legally binding transaction settling the claim of a company’s shareholder for repayment of a loan or
economically equivalent transaction is voidable if the transaction took place in the three years preceding
the opening of proceedings or after the petition. It is unclear whether the loans which fall under this
provision are only those given by the direct shareholder or also include loans by indirect shareholders
or affiliates controlled by (in)direct shareholders and there is no relevant court practice.

**_Law on Financial Dealings considerations_**

Pursuant to the Financial Dealings Act of FBiH, if illiquidity occurs (as defined under that law), the
company cannot execute any payments except those necessary in the ordinary course of business and


-----

those aimed at restoring liquidity. The following are deemed payments in the ordinary course of
business:

(a) procurement of goods and services for ordinary business activities;

(b) operational costs of business (energy, water and similar);

(c) salaries of workers;

(d) VAT, excise duties, social contributions and other taxes that have to be calculated and
paid in accordance with the law;

(e) costs related to procedures before public bodies; and

(f) costs related to documentation needed for commencement and implementation of
financial consolidation and restructuring activities.

In addition, the Financial Dealings Act prescribes that a company cannot perform any activity that may
damage creditors or put certain creditors into unfavorable position, in particular:

- diverting cash payments or financial flows to other persons;

- lending;

- distributing dividends, profits or payment of profits in advance;

- transferring rights to third parties, and especially to related companies; and

- procuring automobiles or spare parts for such vehicles, payments for business entertainment,
accommodation expenses and similar.

Accordingly, a company affected by illiquidity cannot make payments under a guarantee while that
situation is pending.

In addition, pursuant to the Financial Dealings Act, companies are obliged to maintain capital adequacy.
Capital inadequacy exists if as of the date of the relevant financial statements, losses, including losses
carried forward from earlier financial years, amount to at least 1/2 of the registered capital. In case of
capital inadequacy, the management of the company is obliged to implement measures intended for
restoring capital adequacy within its competence, such as finding adequate sources of financing, as well
as convening a shareholders assembly and proposing to shareholders to take measures within its
competence (such as, e.g. reducing registered capital to cover losses).

**Luxembourg**

**_Luxembourg Insolvency Considerations_**

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Senior Secured
Notes may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg
law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be initiated
against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its centre of main interests (within the meaning
of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that
the centre of main interests is located in a jurisdiction where the E.U. Insolvency Regulation is
applicable):

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by
any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts
having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a


-----

state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements); and (ii) has lost its commercial
creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the
assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their
rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company,
except, subject to certain limited exceptions (please see the below applicable provision of the
Luxembourg law dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as
amended (the “Financial Collateral Law 2005”)), for enforcement by secured creditors and the
payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets.
In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e.
is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month
of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for
bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the company’s registered office.
A law of December 19, 2020 (amended on June 30, 2021) has suspended this one month delay
until December 31, 2021. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they
may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of
managers’ / directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple
bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg
commercial code.

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may
order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see the
below applicable provision of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); or

- composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision
to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of
claims by creditors except, among others, for secured creditors (please see the below applicable
provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005).

- In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Senior Secured Notes
may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de
_paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)._
Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against
companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation
of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Law 1915. The management of such liquidation
proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy
proceedings.

Liability of any of the Guarantors existing under the laws of Luxembourg in respect of the relevant
Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation
proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under
Luxembourg law include, among others:

- remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times
the minimum social salary);

- employees’ contributions to social security;

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

- employer’s contribution to social security;

- landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and


-----

- value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg VAT administration.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution
to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing
monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral
Law 2005. Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial
collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial
instruments, as well as valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties are valid and
enforceable even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against
third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the
insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims
or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of
Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law
security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the
Financial Collateral Law 2005. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied
(save the case of fraud).

Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral
arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force
of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable
against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the
collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that
such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures
or arrangement.

**_Impact of Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings on Transactions_**

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended.
Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest
may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly
providing that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a
Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a
reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than
50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of any of the relevant Guarantor’s liabilities in order
to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled
management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of
default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by any of the
relevant Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg during the preference period (période
suspecte) which is a maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that
in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In
particular:

- pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de commerce), specified
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save
in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral
Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by


-----

way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen
due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference
period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested
by the insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are
subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if
they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

- pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the
Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts,
therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate
certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of
adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis à vis the bankruptcy
estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on any of the relevant
Guarantors’ business and assets and the relevant Guarantors’ respective obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets
located in another jurisdiction where the E.U. Insolvency Regulation will not be affected by the opening
of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the
voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the
application of article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and article 16 of the
E.U. Insolvency Regulation).

**_Luxembourg Law Collateral Considerations_**

Under Luxembourg law, contracts are in principle formed by the mere agreement (consentement)
between the parties thereto. However, additional steps are required to enforce security interests against
third parties.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets
will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with
Luxembourg law. The Financial Collateral Law 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and
enforcement of pledges over securities, bank account balances and receivables located or deemed to be
located in Luxembourg.

Security interests such as pledges, and transfer of ownership as a security, granted on financial
instruments and claims are governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to such law, pledge
is effected, not by transfer of title, but by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgor
or to a third-party acting as depository for the pledgor and the pledgor’s preference rights over the
pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgor or the depository remains in possession
of such assets.

A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the
Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession which is effected by
mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the


-----

dispossession is achieved by the entry of the security interest in the share register of the relevant
Luxembourg company. In case of claims, dispossession is effected as against the debtor and any third
parties by the execution of the relevant pledge agreement. Nonetheless, the debtor of a pledged claim
may validly discharge its obligation by performance rendered to the pledgor as long as it has no
knowledge of the pledge. Dispossession of cash collateral is achieved by the security interest thereon
being notified by the debtor and the acceptance thereof by the debtor of such claims.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing his/its rights in the
collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a
security interest in the same collateral. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date
on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over
the same collateral, but which come into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the
appropriate register or by notification) has priority.

**_Luxembourg Guarantee Considerations_**

The Law 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee
the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A company may give a guarantee provided the
giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate purpose, corporate benefit and is in the
best interest of the company. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists
under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from
which the company derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an
economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the
assistance. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual
corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the interest of the group, and that the existence of a
group interest can in certain cases result in the guarantee being held enforceable even where corporate
benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does
not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be
temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the assisting company (i.e., limited to an
aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux propres)), the company
must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the
affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common
strategy aimed at a common objective. As a result, the guarantees/security interests granted by a
Luxembourg company may be subject to limitations in order to ensure their enforceability. Further, a
guarantee or security interest that substantially exceeds the guarantor’s or security provider’s ability to
meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee/security provider and to its other creditors, or
from which the Luxembourg company derives no or very limited direct benefit in return, or where no
direct or indirect consideration is granted to the company in exchange, would expose its directors or
managers to personal liability. In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or
managers of the Luxembourg company, in extreme circumstances the guarantee or security interest
could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public), in the
case of facts consisting of a misuse of corporate assets. Any guarantee granted in connection with the
Senior Secured Notes by Luxembourg companies may be limited to a certain percentage of, among
others, the relevant company’s net worth. The SSN Indenture will provide for general limitation
language to the effect that each guarantee granted therein and each security interest granted as well as
any other obligation, liability or indemnification under a security document will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed/ secured by the relevant guarantor/security provider with
respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of the guarantor/security provider without rendering
the relevant guarantee/security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under Luxembourg and other
applicable law. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no
liability or decreased liability under its guarantee or the security documents to which it is a party.

**Bulgaria**

**_Overview of limitations_**


-----

The validity, binding effect and enforceability of guarantees/security interests granted by Bulgarian
guarantors may be limited or otherwise be affected by the applicable stabilization or insolvency
proceedings against the Bulgarian guarantors, avoidance or similar laws of general application relating
to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and remedies, as well as financial assistance
prohibitions. These are reviewed in turn below.

**_Stabilization Proceedings_**

As of 2017 Bulgarian law also provides for a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure called
“stabilization procedure.” It currently exists as an additional procedure to the traditional restructuring
as a part of the insolvency procedure, and it is similarly to the insolvency procedure a procedure, the
main steps in which must be sanctioned by a court. The stabilization procedure under the Bulgarian
Commerce Act may be applied when there is a “threat of insolvency” but where the debtor is still not
insolvent. Actually, all court cases since the inception of the new procure have been focused on whether
the requirements for launching stabilization were fulfilled and all publicly available judgments so far,
the courts held that the debtor was actually insolvent (in most cases over-indebted), so insolvency rather
than stabilization procedure had to be opened. We are not aware of any case where the new procedure
was applied, and the debtor was successfully restructured to avoid insolvency. In terms of substance,
the stabilization procedure provides for a temporary standstill where all court enforcement and out of
court enforcement procedures (including those under special pledges) shall be stopped. Further there
are rules for partial cram down of the debtor’s liabilities. As of the date of this offering memorandum,
Bulgaria has not yet transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1023. Although a draft bill was published on the
webpage of the Bulgarian government on February 26, 2021, the legislative implementation process
that starts with a submission of a draft bill to the Bulgarian Parliament has not yet been commenced. In
2021, the citizens of Bulgaria voted in three snap parliamentary elections that took place in April, July
and November, respectively, following which some of the country’s largest parties eventually managed
to produce a working coalition government in December 2021. Therefore, the delay in the
implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1023, the deadline for which expired on July 17, 2021, should
come to an end and is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2022. The exact timing for such
implementation will depend on the formation and stability of a new government.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Should a Bulgarian guarantor have its “centre of main interests” (which is presumed to be the case due
to their incorporation in Bulgaria, unless something else is proven) they may be subject to Bulgarian
insolvency proceedings.

The insolvency proceedings do not affect out of court enforcement over Bulgarian special pledges, only
if the out of court enforcement was commenced before launching of the insolvency proceedings.
Otherwise the pledgee under a special pledge may only satisfy within the insolvency proceedings having
a first-ranking priority over the insolvency proceeds from the collateral.

A Bulgarian guarantor would be deemed insolvent in any of the following three cases occurs. The first
case is one of balance sheet insolvency (over indebtedness). When a creditor claims that a debtor is
balance sheet insolvent (as a ground for commencement of insolvency proceedings against the latter) it
has to be established that the debtor’s “liabilities exceed his assets.” All liabilities must be compared to
all assets for the purpose. This includes all existing liabilities including those that are not yet due (e.g.
future payments under an existing contract). Contingent (conditional) liabilities however are not
covered. There is no formal requirement that the negative balance for the purposes of over indebtedness
should be substantial and though the dominating understanding among scholars is that minor negative
balance should not be taken into account where the prospects for the entity are positive, it cannot be
ruled out that even a minor negative balance may trigger over indebtedness. The second case is the one
of cash flow insolvency. This means a state of inability to pay: (i) a monetary obligation under or in
relation to a commercial transaction, or (ii) public law obligation towards the State/municipalities
connected with the commercial activity of the entity; or (iii) private law obligation towards the


-----

State/municipalities. So, in the cash flow insolvency scenario a creditor must establish both: (i) the
existence of a particular payment obligation of any of the three types listed above that was due but was
not paid (i.e.—the “First Condition”), and the inability of the debtor to pay (“Second Condition”). The
First Condition involves establishment of only factual matters. The Second Condition however requires
again a comparison between assets and liabilities of the debtor, although in a more limited manner
(compared to the over indebtedness scenario). In particular (according to the case law) in order to
determine whether a debtor is unable to pay, the ratio has to be established between the current/shortterm assets (i.e. those that can be easily turned into cash) vis à vis short-term liabilities (i.e. existing
liabilities with a maturity of up to 1 year in the future). If the ratio is below 1 (meaning that the shortterm liabilities exceed the short-term assets), it is normally presumed that the debtor is unable to pay
(i.e. the Second Condition is met). The third case where insolvency proceedings should be opened is
the one of “concealed insolvency.” This means that an entity is concealing commercial activity behind
an insolvent entity, so if that is proven to be case insolvency proceedings must be opened against the
former.

In general, the opening of insolvency proceedings by a Bulgarian court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts. However, the insolvency administrator may choose to terminate certain
contracts as to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company. Any power of attorney
terminates upon initiation of bankruptcy proceedings provided that the insolvency court has established
that the debtor jeopardizes the interests of creditors and that the debtor has been deprived of the right to
manage and dispose of the property of the company.

Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on the relevant business and assets
of United Group Bulgaria, Viva Telecom and BTC (the “Bulgarian Guarantors”) and their respective
obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Avoidance Claims_**

Within the insolvency proceedings certain Bulgarian avoidance rule may have to be considered. The
general claim that creditors may take recourse to, even if there is no insolvency is Actio Pauliana
(павлов иск) under art. 135 of the Obligations and Contracts Act. Under that claim a creditor may
request that any act of the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider having a detrimental effect on the
creditor be declared void as against the creditor, provided that the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider
knew about that detrimental effect at the time of performing the act. In the context of non-gratuitous
acts, the plaintiff (creditor) must furthermore prove that counterparty (creditor) to the Bulgarian
guarantor/security provider also knew about the detrimental effect of the challenged act on other
creditors. This means proof that both the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider and its counterparty
knew there were other creditors having valid claims existing before the challenged act and the act in
question was detrimental to them. Pure knowledge is sufficient, it is not necessary to prove that there
was intention to inflict detrimental effect on the other creditors. However, if the parties intend to defraud
the other creditors it is not necessary as a prerequisite for the Actio Pauliana that the respective creditor’s
claim should have arisen before the challenged act. The detrimental effect for the purposes of Actio
Pauliana exists if the possibility for the creditor to satisfy himself from the Bulgarian guarantor/security
provider’s property is reduced, which means that via the challenged act created or increased its state of
inability to pay to other creditors.

In addition (subject to some technical exceptions) the following acts and transactions may be declared
null and void with respect to the insolvency creditors if made by the Bulgarian guarantor/security
provider after the initial date of insolvency or over indebtedness and cumulatively—within the
timelines—under the following items (i) (iii) before the submission of the application for opening of
insolvency proceedings: (i) performance of a monetary obligation that was not yet due (неизискуемо)
regardless of the manner of performance made within a one year period; (ii) performance of a monetary
obligation that was due (изискуемо) regardless of the manner of performance made within a six month
period; and (iii) establishing a pledge, mortgage or personal security (i.e. a guarantee) to secure a
previously not secured obligation made within a two year period.


-----

In addition to other general statutory rules providing for setting aside of certain acts and transactions,
the following acts and transactions carried out by the debtor (within the timeline under items 1 3 below)
before the submission of the application for opening of insolvency proceedings may be set aside with
respect to the insolvency creditors: (i) establishment of a mortgage, pledge or personal security for
another person’s debts, effected within one year, but not earlier than the date of the insolvency or over
indebtedness, as the case may be; (ii) establishment of a mortgage, pledge or personal security for
another person’s debts to the benefit of a creditor, which is a related party to the debtor, effected within
two years; (iii) a transaction that is detrimental to the creditors, a party to which is a person related to
the debtor, effected within two years; (iv) a transaction where the consideration provided by the
insolvent Bulgarian guarantor/security provider exceeds significantly the consideration granted by its
counterparty, effected within 2 years period before the submission of the application for opening of
insolvency proceedings but not earlier than the date when the Bulgarian guarantor/security provider
was in a state of inability to pay or over indebtedness; (v) gratuitous transaction made within a two year
period (resp. three years if made to a related person).

Lastly, the following shall be considered null and void (in accordance with art. 646, par. 1 of the
Bulgarian Commerce Act (Търговски закон)) with respect to the insolvency creditors if carried out
after the date of the decision on opening of insolvency proceedings and in violation of the insolvency
procedures: (i) performance of an obligation that had occurred prior to the date of the decision on
opening of insolvency proceedings; (ii) establishing a pledge, or mortgage; (iii) transactions with rights
or properties from the insolvency estate.

**_Limitations with respect to corporate benefit_**

Bulgarian law does not explicitly require the existence of a corporate benefit upon the grant of security
for a third-party debt. However, the grant of the SSN Guarantees and the security interests by the
Bulgarian Guarantors without benefit or obvious rationale for the Bulgarian Guarantors may be
interpreted as an act with a detrimental effect and thus subject to certain of the claims set forth in
“Avoidance Claims” above, such as: (i) actio pauliana (Павлов иск) within and outside of insolvency
and (ii) insolvency avoidance claims within insolvency.

**_Limitations to avoid overindebtedness_**

The obligations of the Bulgarian Guarantors are further limited to the extent that they result in (i) over
indebtedness (свръхзадлъжнялост) in the meaning of Article 742, paragraph 1 of the Bulgarian
Commerce Act (Търговски закон), promulgated in State Gazette No. 48/18.06.1991, effective July 1,
1991, as amended, and (ii) a state of immediate threat of insolvency in the sense of Article 762,
paragraph 1 (непосредствена опасност от неплатежоспособност) of the Bulgarian Commerce Act.

**_Limitations with respect to subordination arrangements_**

The subordination arrangements in the SSN Guarantees assumed by the Bulgarian Guarantors (see “SSN
_Guarantees” above) may not be enforceable against third parties in case of enforcement proceedings_
against the Bulgarian Guarantors. There is still no court judgement in Bulgaria confirming that the
respective public or private bailiff (държавен или частен съдебен изпълнител) or insolvency
administrator (синдик) who would be in charge of the distribution among creditors should in case of
such arrangements disregard the statutory rules on ranking of creditors and apply instead the contractual
subordination arrangements. Certain academic scholars insist that subordination arrangements may not
be binding to any third-party different to those under the contract and would in particular would not
bind the respective public or private bailiff (държавен или частен съдебен изпълнител) or insolvency
administrator (синдик) as the procedural rules for creditors ranking are mandatory in nature.

**_Validity of guarantees in connection with litigation involving the Vivacom Group_**


-----

The validity, binding effect and enforceability of guarantees and security interests granted by the
Bulgarian Guarantors may be limited or otherwise be affected by the litigation described in “Our
_Business—Legal Proceedings.”_

**_Use of Security Agent and Parallel Debt_**

Under Bulgarian law, security interests can be granted to a security trustee for the claims of all
bondholders only if the security trustee is a bank. Parallel debt arrangements governed by a foreign
system of law are also often used, mainly for credit agreements where the Bulgarian security trustee
concept is not applicable.

We note that parallel debt structures governed by a foreign law under which such arrangements are
valid and enforceable have not yet been tested in Bulgarian courts.

**_Enforcement over Bulgarian Special Pledges—General Rules_**

Under Bulgarian law, depending on the type of security, certain perfection requirements as set forth
below must be satisfied in order for a security to become enforceable.

The following enforcement mechanisms are possible: (i) court execution over dematerialized shares in
a joint stock company (and sale) pursuant to the statutory provisions on execution and securing of claims
(for which a prior writ of execution is required); and (ii) out of court execution over dematerialized
shares in a joint stock company or shares (quotas) in a limited liability company through a private sale,
pursuant to the currently effective legislation (subject to amendments effective as of January 2023
(unless extensions are introduced), which require the out-of-court proceedings to be carried out under
rules involving greater transparency and publicity than the existing rules), whereas the choice between
court or out of court execution is at the sole discretion of the pledgor.

Regarding collateral enforcement in this section only out of court enforcement of non-possessory
special pledges (over going concerns, shares in limited liability companies and joint stock companies)
under Bulgarian law will be considered. The term “out of court” refers to an extra judicial summary
procedure for the seizure and sale of the collateral (i.e., a procedure without court involvement),
pursuant to the rules set out in the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act. Under the Bulgarian Special Pledges
Act, such out of court enforcement (i) does not require a prior Bulgarian, or any other court judgment,
arbitral award, writ of execution or other judicial ruling; (ii) may be undertaken without acceleration of
the Senior Secured Notes for the amount outstanding and payable under the Senior Secured Notes at
the date of enforcement; and (iii) may be carried out simultaneously, independently and irrespective of
any insolvency proceedings that may be opened with respect to the Bulgarian guarantor/security
provider. This out of court Collateral enforcement is in effect a “fast track” recovery procedure
irrespective of any other pending or contemplated actions or litigation proceedings.

The enforcement starts with a notification of the commencement of out of court pledge enforcement to
the Bulgarian Central Register of Special Pledges or another register depending on the type of collateral
by the Trustee, on behalf and at the direction of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. This does not
require the assistance or the consent of the respective Bulgarian pledgor. The Trustee shall notify the
respective pledgor of the commencement of the out of court enforcement proceeding, specifying,
amongst other information, the nature of the default, the outstanding amount due and payable, and the
collateral subject to sale. This notification may be served on the pledgee immediately following the
notification to the respective register. Upon service of the above-mentioned notifications to the register
and the applicable pledgor the Trustee is entitled to take possession of the Collateral that is the subject
of enforcement. In the event the pledgor refuses to voluntarily surrender such Collateral, the Trustee
may seek the intervention of and engage a bailiff (public or private enforcement officer) at the expense
of the pledgor. On the basis of a certificate from the register confirming that enforcement has been
initiated, such bailiff is entitled to force the pledgor to surrender the collateral, with police assistance,
as necessary. The collateral sale may occur after expiry of a 2 week grace period from the notification


-----

to the register, to enable making voluntary payment before the collateral is sold. During this grace
period, the Trustee may nevertheless organize the collateral sale (take possession of the collateral,
engage the depository (as defined below), identify creditors, and so on). The collateral sale must be
undertaken by and in the name of the Trustee. The Trustee must make reasonable efforts to achieve the
best price for the collateral and there are some specific requirements to publicize the terms of the sale
in advance by registration with the register. As of January 1, 2023, the Trustee should report in the
respective register, at least 14 days before expiry of the sale period, all details about the pledgor and the
property being sold, the minimum price, the rules of the sale, place and date of the sale and the deadline
for acceptance of offers. The Trustee may engage the pledgor, assuming it is cooperative, as its agent
to manage the actual collateral sale process. The Trustee shall appoint a professional accountant or a
bailiff (the “Depository”) who will administer the proceeds collected from the collateral sale. Amongst
other things, the Depository shall (i) identify the creditors who have rights to the collateral that is subject
to enforcement (“Qualified Creditors”) and notify the Qualified Creditors, who have two weeks to
comment, after which the definitive list of Qualified Creditors is finalized and is not subject to
challenge, (ii) open a special purpose depository bank account in the name of the Depository for the
collection of sale proceeds, (iii) provide information on the contemplated distribution of proceed to the
creditor(s) (which will be only the Trustee as creditor on behalf of the Bondholders), and (iv) if there
are no objections or challenges, distribute such proceeds to the creditors (which will be only the Trustee
as creditor on behalf of the Bondholders).

**_Specifics regarding Pledge over Shares in Joint Stock Companies (such as BTC) and Enforcement_**
**_over such Shares_**

Shares in a joint stock company, existing in a dematerialized form (such as the shares in BTC) may be
pledged under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act. This requires an agreement in writing and registration
with the Bulgarian Central Depository which is the institution in whose databases dematerialized shares
exist in a legal form.

Enforcement over such shares requires respectively that the commencement of enforcement should be
registered with the Central Depository AD. The enforcement may take place by an out of court transfer
of the pledged shares so that the pledgee may satisfy the secured debt directly from its sale proceeds.

**_Specifics regarding Pledge over Shares in Limited Liability Companies (such as Viva Telecom and_**
**_United Group Bulgaria) and Enforcement over such Shares_**

Shares in a limited liability company (such as Viva Telecom and United Group Bulgaria) may be
pledged under the Bulgarian Special Pledges Act. This requires an agreement in writing with notarized
signatures and registration with the Bulgarian Commerce Register. Enforcement over such shares
requires respectively that the commencement of enforcement should be registered with the Bulgarian
Commerce Register.

The pledgee will be restricted in its options in case of enforcement only to enforcement through a
liquidation of the company the shares in which are pledged, and the pledgee may satisfy the secured
debt only out of the liquidation quota for the pledgor whose quota, in turn, may only be formed after
voluntary liquidation proceedings. In particular, the general possibility under the Bulgarian Special
Pledges Act to sell the pledged property out of court is inapplicable when it comes to enforcement over
shares in a limited liability company. The attempts of some lawyers nevertheless to effect such an
enforcement sale of shares in a limited liability company are regularly dismissed by the authorities in
Bulgaria.

**_Bulgarian Guarantee Considerations_**

Except for bank guarantees, under Bulgarian law there are no provisions regulating abstract guarantees
that are independent of the novation or replacement of the guaranteed debt or of any changes to the
creditors and the debtors under the guaranteed debt. Thus, even if a guarantee is valid under the
applicable law, the Bulgarian Guarantors may oppose its validity based on certain Bulgarian law


-----

principles claiming that they are rules of overriding nature that should be applied regardless of the
foreign applicable law. Although the overriding nature of the local rules has been confirmed by court
practice with regard to certain of the limitations set forth below, there is no conclusive case law
evidencing that the remaining rules would not be considered as overriding mandatory rules and/or rules
of public policy. Such rules are as follows:

(i) a guarantee will terminate upon novation (including by way of change of the parties or
replacement of the debt) or transfer of the guaranteed debt, unless the relevant Bulgarian
guarantor expressly agrees that the guarantee extends to the novated or transferred obligations;

(ii) a Bulgarian guarantor will not be liable for any increased amount of the guaranteed debt, unless
it has expressly agreed to such liability, and the extension of maturity of the guaranteed debt in
relation to the debtor is not effective in relation to the Bulgarian guarantor, unless the Bulgarian
guarantor has expressly agreed to such extension;

(iii) a Bulgarian guarantor will not remain liable under the guarantee after the due date for repayment
of the debt, unless the creditor has claimed repayment from the principal debtor within six months
as of that repayment date; and

(iv) since under Bulgarian law a guarantee would be considered as an accessory personal security,
the waiver of the right to refer to the personal defenses of the respective debtor as well as to the
set-off right of the respective debtor may not be enforceable under mandatory Bulgarian law and
therefore the Bulgarian guarantor can avail itself of such personal defenses and set-off rights. For
the same reason, the valid existence and the scope of the guarantee depends on the valid existence
and the scope of the guaranteed debt.

**Greece**

**_Insolvency proceedings_**

In Greece, insolvency and pre-insolvency proceedings are governed primarily by Greek law 4738/2020
(the “Greek Bankruptcy Code”).

The Greek Bankruptcy Code provides for the following insolvency proceedings:

(a) bankruptcy—liquidation procedure (article 75 et seq. of the Greek Bankruptcy Code).

(b) rehabilitation procedure (article 31 et seq. of the Greek Bankruptcy Code); and

(c) out-of-court debt settlement procedure (article 5 et seq. of the Greek Bankruptcy Code).

On March 1, 2021, the Greek Bankruptcy Code repealed Greek law 4307/2014, which previously
provided for an extraordinary special administration process intended to facilitate the sale of a debtor’s
business as a going concern, or the sale of individual business sectors and of individual assets, which
do not constitute business sectors. However, Greek law 4307/2014 continues to apply to proceedings
that were pending before the entry into effect of the Greek Bankruptcy Code.

_Bankruptcy—liquidation procedure_

Bankruptcy proceedings are applicable to both legal entities pursuing an economic objective, including
_sociétés anonymes and limited liability companies, and to natural persons. A debtor may request to be_
declared bankrupt when it is unable to fulfill its overdue financial obligations in a general and permanent
way (cessation of payments), or when the debtor foresees an imminent inability to fulfill its financial
obligations when they become due and payable (threatened cessation of payments). Cessation of
payments is presumed by law if a debtor does not repay due financial obligations to the Greek State,
social security institutions, or credit or financial institutions of an amount of at least 40% of the total


-----

due obligations for a period of at least six months, provided that the non-performing obligation is in
excess of €30,000.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated only through the issuance of a court decision upon application
of the insolvent debtor, its creditors or, for public interest purposes, of public prosecutor. The debtor is
obliged to apply for bankruptcy any time before the cessation of payments but in any case within 30
days from its occurrence.

Anyone having legitimate interest in a bankruptcy proceeding may file an application for interim
measures after the filing of the bankruptcy application. The court may rule for the imposition of any
interim measures it deemed appropriate to prevent any harm to the creditors due to the deterioration of
the insolvent debtor’s assets or reduction of the value thereof, including the suspension of individual
enforcement actions until the court’s decision on the electronic solvency registry. Such suspension shall
not apply to enforcement actions by secured creditors on assets on which they have received security in
rem. Moreover, the interim measures shall not affect any rights under a financial collateral agreement,
or a close-out netting provision within the meaning, of Greek law 3301/2004.

The competent bodies of the bankruptcy proceedings include the bankruptcy court, the judge rapporteur,
the bankruptcy administrator and the creditors’ assembly.

Upon issuance by the bankruptcy court of the decision declaring bankruptcy, and subject to the
application of the provisions on the small-scale bankruptcy, a judge rapporteur, a judge and a
bankruptcy administrator (σύνδικος) are appointed and the estate of the debtor is sealed. After the
initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankruptcy procedure is supervised by the judge rapporteur
and administered by the bankruptcy administrator, who is obliged at a later stage to publicly invite the
creditors to announce their claims in order for them to be verified by the administrator.

Transactions entered into by the debtor in the period between commencement of the cessation of
payments and the declaration of bankruptcy (the “suspect period”), or, in cases of transactions that are
mandatorily revoked, in the period between the six months preceding the suspect period and the end of
the suspect period, which are deemed detrimental to the debtor’s creditors, are either mandatorily
revoked by the bankruptcy court or are revocable at the court’s discretion. Application for the revocation
of any such transactions before the bankruptcy court is generally filed by the bankruptcy administrator.
Exceptionally, a creditor may also file such application if it has requested the bankruptcy administrator
to apply for a revocation and the latter fails to take any action within two months from the creditor’s
request.

The following transactions are deemed to be detrimental to the creditors of the insolvent entity and are
mandatorily revoked by the court: (a) donations, gratuitous dispositions and all transactions conducted
at an undervalue; (b) payments of obligations that were not due and payable; (c) payments of due and
payable obligations that were not made in cash or in the agreed means of payment, except for voluntary
transfers of real estate to credit or financial institution against payment of debtor’s due and payable
obligations; and (d) provision of security in order to secure pre-existing claims for which the debtor had
not assumed an obligation to provide such security, or in order to secure new claims assumed by the
debtor in replacement of pre-existing obligations (subject to the legislative decree of 17.7/13.8.1923).

Any contract or payment of due and payable obligations within the suspect period may also be revoked
at the court’s discretion, provided that the third party knew that the debtor was in cessation of payments
and that the contract or payment was detrimental to the debtor’s creditors.

In addition, acts of the insolvent debtor concluded during a five-year period before the declaration of
bankruptcy are revoked if the debtor acted with the intention to harm or to benefit certain of its creditors
and its counterparties knew that the debtor was acting maliciously.


-----

Upon declaration of bankruptcy, there is a moratorium (suspension) on enforcement of individual
claims by creditors. In particular, it is prohibited to initiate or continue any enforcement procedures, or
to file any new lawsuits or continue any (pending) litigation against the insolvent debtor in connection
with the insolvency estate. Such prohibition does not apply to creditors with claims that have been
secured by specific privilege or security in rem on specific assets of the insolvency estate for a period
of nine months following the declaration of bankruptcy. The above exemption does not apply in cases
of sale of assets of a business as a functional whole whereby the secured asset forms part of such
functional whole.

Following the finalization of the creditors’ claims verification, the bankruptcy process enters into the
stage of liquidation of the debtor’s business and assets, either as a whole or on an itemized basis. The
liquidation proceeds are then distributed to the announced and verified creditors. The distribution of the
liquidation proceeds takes place in accordance with the applicable creditors’ ranking rules.

The bankruptcy proceedings are terminated upon: (a) the sale of all debtor’s assets and distribution of
the proceeds to the creditors; or (b) the cessation of such proceedings either due to lack of assets or due
to the lapse of five years from the formation of the creditors’ assembly or 15 years from the declaration
of bankruptcy; or (c) the full repayment of all creditors’ claims (including principal and interest) accrued
up to the declaration of bankruptcy.

The Greek Bankruptcy Code also sets forth a simplified procedure with respect to “small-scale”
bankruptcy proceedings; i.e., for natural persons with assets up to €350,000 and for legal entities
meeting any two of the following criteria: (a) turnover up to €700,000, (b) assets of up to €350,000 and
(c) an average of 10 employees.

_Rehabilitation procedure_

The Greek Bankruptcy Code sets out a collective pre-bankruptcy rehabilitation procedure that allows
debtors, who pursue a business activity, have their center of principal interests in Greece and are in a
status of general cessation of payments or facing an imminent threat of cessation of payments, to avoid
bankruptcy and remain operational on the basis of a rehabilitation plan (the “rehabilitation plan”). The
objective of such scheme is the execution and ratification by the court of a rehabilitation agreement
between either the debtor and its creditors or between the creditors with the aim to enable the debtor to
satisfy, in whole or in part, its creditors and remains operational, following ratification of the
rehabilitation agreement. The hearing date for the ratification of the rehabilitation agreement is set
within two months from the submission of the application to the competent court.

The rehabilitation agreement is ratified by a court decision following the submission of an application
to the competent court by: (a) the insolvent debtor or a creditor who is a party to the rehabilitation
agreement, _provided that the rehabilitation agreement has been concluded between the debtor and_
creditors representing 50% of claims with a special privilege and 50% of all other claims, in either case
affected by the rehabilitation agreement; or (b) any of the creditors, if the rehabilitation agreement has
been concluded without the participation of the debtor, provided that (i) such creditors represent 50%
of claims with a special privilege and 50% of all other claims, in either case affected by the rehabilitation
agreement, and (ii) the debtor is already in cessation of payments.

In the event that the rehabilitation agreement is not concluded with creditors representing the above
percentages, the competent court may still ratify such agreement provided that: (a) it has been approved
by creditors representing 60% of the total claims against the debtor, including 40% of claims with a
special privilege, (b) the non-consenting affected creditors are treated favorably compared to any
creditor with a claim of a lower rank; (c) no category of creditors shall receive, under the terms of the
rehabilitation agreement, a value in excess of its total claim against the debtor; and (d) for cases of very
small entities, the rehabilitation agreement has been proposed or approved by the debtor.


-----

The following need also to be satisfied in order for the rehabilitation agreement to be ratified by the
competent court: (a) it needs to be reasonably expected that the debtor’s business will become viable
following ratification of the rehabilitation agreement; (b) it needs to be reasonably expected that the
position of the creditors is not impaired; (c) the entering into the rehabilitation agreement did not come
as a result of wilful misconduct or other unfair practices or bad faith of the debtor, creditor or any other
third party and does not violate any mandatory Greek law provisions; (d) the rehabilitation agreement
does not violate the equal treatment of creditors; and (e) debtor’s consent (in the event that the
application to the court has been submitted only by the creditors).

Upon ratification, the rehabilitation plan is binding upon all creditors, including any dissenting and nonparticipating creditors.

From the submission of the application for the ratification of the rehabilitation agreement and until the
issuance of a relevant court decision, any individual or collective enforcement action against the debtor
is automatically suspended for a maximum period of four months. Such suspension is available only
one time per debtor. Following the above mentioned four-month period, a moratorium may be imposed
following an application to that effect by anyone having a legal interest. In case of material business or
social reasons, such moratorium may also be extended in favor of guarantors. Additionally, a
moratorium may also be imposed even before the submission of the application for the ratification of
the rehabilitation agreement, following an application by the debtor or a creditor provided that: (a) the
applicant files a written declaration of creditors representing at least 20% of the total debtors’ claims,
stating that such claims form part of the negotiation process with the aim to reach an agreement; and
(b) there is an urgent situation or an imminent danger in accordance with the provisions of the Greek
Code of Civil Procedure. Such moratorium is valid until the application for the ratification of the
rehabilitation agreement and up to a maximum period of four months.

_Out-of-court debt settlement procedure_

Under the out-of-court debt settlement process set out in the Greek Bankruptcy Code, individuals or
legal entities eligible to be declared bankrupt may apply online to the Special Secretariat for Private
Debt Management of the Ministry of Finance through an electronic platform for the settlement of their
debt towards: (a) financial institutions, including servicers, (b) the Greek State, and (c) social security
institutions, subject to certain exemptions (e.g., a debtor may not file an application for the opening of
an out-of-court debt settlement process in the event that 90% of its total debts is to a single financial
institution). Upon filing of the application, there is a moratorium (suspension) on enforcement of claims
requested to be settled. Investment service providers, undertakings for collective investment in
transferable securities, alternative investment funds and their managers, credit, financial and
insurance/reinsurance institutions fall outside the scope of the Greek Bankruptcy Code and are therefore
not eligible to apply as debtors for the opening of the out-of-court debt settlement process.

Creditors that are financial institutions may accept the invitation for out-of-court debt settlement and
submit a settlement proposal to the debtor. A restructuring agreement is then executed, provided that
the debtor and the majority of the participating creditors (i.e., 60% or more in terms of the value of the
relevant claims) who are financial institutions and participating secured creditors representing at least
40% of the total secured claims of financial institutions consent. The results of such settlement apply to
all financial institutions involved. If the proposal provides for debt settlement against the Greek State
and social security institutions, such creditors are deemed to have automatically consented, subject to
certain requirements being fulfilled.

The process may also be initiated by the creditors, at their own discretion, upon service of an invitation
to the debtor to apply for the opening of such procedure within 45 days from such invitation. The lapse
of this period without the filing of a relevant application by the debtor terminates the process.

**_Provisions on Guarantee_**


-----

Under Greek corporate law, a Greek societe anonyme is prohibited from granting loans or providing
securities and/or guarantees for the acquisition of its own shares or the shares of its direct or indirect
parent, unless a specific whitewash procedure is followed, and the minimum net equity position is
preserved. In relation to the SSN Guarantee to be granted by Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A.,
the amount of the guarantee, indemnity or other liability or obligation of Wind Hellas
Telecommunications S.A. under the SSN Indenture and any documentation related to the Transactions
will be limited to the amount of the direct or indirect corporate benefit derived by Wind Hellas; i.e., any
amounts of the proceeds from the Bridge Facilities that will be provided to Wind Hellas in connection
with the Wind Hellas Indebtedness Refinancing.

Subject to the general provisions setting out the scope of its Guarantee, Wind Hellas will waive certain
rights and defenses under the SSN Indenture that would otherwise be available to it, including but not
limited to: (i) any right to refuse payment before the person seeking enforcement has first requested
such payment from the Issuer or the Guarantors (in Greek enstasi dizisseos, article 855 of the Greek
Civil Code); (ii) any right of the Issuer or the Guarantors to object against the person seeking
enforcement (article 853 of the Greek Civil Code); (iii) any right of recourse against the Issuer or the
Guarantors or right to demand security from the Issuer or the Guarantors, in each case until full
repayment of any amount due; (iv) any right of substitution in personam or in rem of the person seeking
enforcement, even if Wind Hellas has paid in full any claims of the person seeking enforcement (article
858 of the Greek Civil Code); (v) any right to be released from its guarantee, indemnity or other
liabilities or obligations hereunder until the full discharge of any claims of the person seeking
enforcement against the Issuer or the Guarantors (article 864 of the Greek Civil Code); and (vi) any
right to demand security under the conditions laid down in article 861 of the Greek Civil Code.

###### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated
January, 2022, each Initial Purchaser has severally and not jointly agreed to purchase, together
with all other Initial Purchasers, and the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, Senior
Secured Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €980 million.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Senior Secured Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes at the price to investors indicated on
the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering of the Senior Secured Notes, the
Initial Purchasers may from time to time vary the offering price and other selling terms without notice.
Sales of the Senior Secured Notes by the Initial Purchasers in the United States may be made through
affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. The offering of the Senior Secured Notes by the Initial Purchasers is
subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole
or in part.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments which the Initial Purchasers may be required
to make in respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and
pay certain expenses of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. The Issuer has agreed, subject to
certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities
issued by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Senior
Secured Notes) during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the
date that is 45 days after the date of such Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit
a public offering of the Senior Secured Notes or the SSN Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer, the Senior Secured
Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, the Senior Secured
Notes and the SSN Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering
memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Senior Secured
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell
in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession
this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about, and to observe, any
restrictions relating to the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, the distribution of this offering
memorandum and resales of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Market for Senior Secured Notes**

The Issuer has been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market
in the Senior Secured Notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any
time without notice. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Senior Secured Notes on any national
securities exchange or for inclusion of the Senior Secured Notes on any automated dealer quotation
system, except that application will be made, through the Listing Agent, to the Authority for the Senior
Secured Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange. We cannot assure you that this
application will be approved or that, if approved, such listing will be maintained. No assurance can be
given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. If an active trading market
for the Senior Secured Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Senior Secured


-----

Notes may be adversely affected. If the Senior Secured Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount
from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities,
the Group’s operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other
factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the
_Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in which case_
_your ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes may be limited.”_

**Stabilization**

The Stabilizing Manager may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering
transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales
in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Stabilizing Manager. Stabilizing
transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not
exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Senior Secured Notes in
the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.

The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at
any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the
Senior Secured Notes. These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of
the Senior Secured Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions.

Pursuant to a reorganization by the Stabilizing Manager in accordance with Council Regulation (EC)
No. 2157/2001 of October 8, 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE), on or about January
22, 2022, the Stabilizing Manager will change its legal form to a European Company (Societas
Europeaes or “SE”) and will be known as J.P. Morgan SE.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and
sell the Senior Secured Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing
transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the
Stabilizing Manager of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering of
the Senior Secured Notes. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the
purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Senior Secured Notes while the
offering of the Senior Secured Notes is in progress.

These activities by the Stabilizing Manager, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their
own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Senior Secured Notes.
As a result, the price of the Senior Secured Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might
exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial
Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

Persons who purchase Senior Secured Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp
duty, taxes, and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

**Notes are Not Being Registered**

The Senior Secured Notes (including the SSN Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered
under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance
on Regulation S. Until 40-days after the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue
Date of the Senior Secured Notes, an offer or sale of the Senior Secured Notes initially sold in reliance
on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than
in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings


-----

given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Senior Secured Notes are restricted as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to
be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the
Guarantors; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Senior Secured Notes in, from or otherwise involving the
United Kingdom.

Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker
dealers registered under the Exchange Act.

**Settlement**

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made to investors on or about the
date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which is business days following
the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule
15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in business
days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish
to trade the Senior Secured Notes on the date of pricing will be required, by virtue of the fact that the
Senior Secured Notes will initially settle business days following the date of pricing of the Senior
Secured Notes, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their
own advisors.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the
future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for United Group, certain
direct and indirect shareholders of United Group, and their respective affiliates, for which they received
or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, each of the Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and lenders (and in the case of J.P. Morgan AG, facility
agent) under the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement entered into in connection with the debt
financing of the Wind Hellas Acquisition (which will be repaid with the proceeds of the Senior Secured
Notes). Similarly, certain of the Initial Purchasers are arrangers and lenders under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility or have acted as underwriters in the offering of Wind Hellas Existing Notes
(which are expected to be redeemed with a portion of the proceeds from the Offering).

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of
ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us or
our affiliates, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, are likely to hedge or
may hedge, as the case may be, their credit exposure to us or our affiliates consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps


-----

or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Senior Secured Notes offered
hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Senior Secured
Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and
may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

Funds, limited partnerships or other entities managed by or otherwise advised by the Sponsor or any
independent debt funds or entities managed by or advised by the Sponsor or other affiliates of the
Sponsor may place a purchase order for and be allocated Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price per
Senior Secured Notes equal to the applicable issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering
memorandum, subject to a pass through or payment to such persons of the Initial Purchasers’ discount
in respect of the Senior Secured Notes purchased by such persons. In addition, certain members of our
management may purchase a limited amount of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

**_MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior
Secured Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Senior Secured
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_PRIIPs Regulation / Prospectus Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Mediation Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key
information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Senior Secured
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This offering memorandum has been
prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to
an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of the Senior Secured Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

In the United Kingdom, this offering memorandum is being distributed only to, and is directed only at,
and any offer subsequently made may only be directed at persons who are “qualified investors” (as
defined in the

Prospectus Regulation) (i) who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling
within Article 19 (5) of the Order and/or (ii) who are high net worth companies (or persons to whom it
may otherwise be lawfully communicated) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order (all such
persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum must not be acted


-----

on or relied on in the United Kingdom by persons who are not relevant persons. In the United Kingdom,
any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is only available to,
and will be engaged in with, relevant persons.

###### TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

The following restrictions will apply to the Senior Secured Notes. You are advised to consult legal
counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Senior Secured Notes
offered hereby.

The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any
state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby are being
offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act
and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act. As used in this section, the terms “United States,” “U.S. person” and “offshore
transaction” have the meanings given to them in Regulation S. Accordingly, we are offering and selling
the Senior Secured Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re offer and resale only:

- in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as
defined in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S and, in this
case, only to investors who, if resident in a Member State of the European Economic Area, are
not retail investors, each defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFiD II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Mediation Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFiD II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation.

In addition, until 40-days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, an
offer or sale of the Senior Secured Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not
participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer
or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

Each purchaser of the Senior Secured Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have
acknowledged, represented to and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(4) It understands and acknowledges that the Senior Secured Notes have not been registered under
the Securities Act or any other applicable state securities law, and that the Senior Secured Notes
are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or
any state securities law, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, and may not
be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law, pursuant to an
exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(5) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and
it is either:

(b) a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of
the Senior Secured Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and the
acquisition of the Senior Secured Notes will be for its own account or for the account
of another qualified institutional buyer; or

(c) not a U.S. person, nor is it buying for the account of a U.S. person, and is purchasing
the Senior Secured Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S.

(6) It acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or
the Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of
any Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering
memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment
decision with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial
Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this offering
memorandum. It also acknowledges that it has had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the Senior Secured Notes as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase any of the Senior Secured Notes.

(7) It is purchasing the Senior Secured Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with
a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition
of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or
their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A,
Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act.

(8) Each holder of the Senior Secured Notes agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor
account for which it is purchasing the Senior Secured Notes, and each subsequent holder of the
Senior Secured Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or
otherwise transfer such Senior Secured Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction
Termination Date”) that is, in the case of Senior Secured Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A,
one year after the later of the date of the Issue Date, the issue date of any additional notes and
the last date on which the Issuer or any of their affiliates was the owner of such respective series
of Notes (or any predecessor thereto), in the case of Senior Secured Notes sold in reliance on
Regulation S, 40-days after the later of the Issue Date, the issue date of any additional Senior
Secured Notes, and the date on which such respective series of Senior Secured Notes (or any
predecessor thereto) were first offered to persons other than distributors, only (i) to the Issuer
or any subsidiaries thereof; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared
effective under the Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are eligible
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a qualified

144A under the Securities Act; (iv) pursuant to offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons
occurring outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities
Act and in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any other

the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property
of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance
with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and
further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer
(I) pursuant to clauses (iv) or (v) prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date to require the
delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of
them, (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form
appearing on the other side of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the
Trustee and (III) agrees that it will give to each person to whom this security is transferred a

Note and each Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for 144A Book-entry Interests
will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

###### ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS

The Issuer is a Dutch company. The Existing Subsidiary Guarantors are entities organized under the
laws of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Bosnia, Bulgaria and Herzegovina and Slovenia. The Wind
Hellas Guarantor is organized under the laws of Greece. All the respective directors and executive
officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors reside outside of the United States. Substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective directors and officers are located outside the
United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, in accordance with the terms of the
SSN Indenture, to accept service of process in the United States through agents designated for such
purpose, it may not be possible for holders of the Senior Secured Notes to (a) effect service of process
upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers, or (b) enforce judgments of
courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability of such entities or persons under the U.S.
securities laws and state securities laws or other laws against any such entities or persons in the courts
of a foreign jurisdiction.

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in
the Netherlands. None of the directors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors reside in the United States
and a substantial amount of the Issuer’s assets, and a substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch
Guarantors are located outside of the United States. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the
United States may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to
enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether
or not predicated solely upon

U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which
is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated before a competent Dutch court. A
Dutch court will, under current practice, generally confirm a final, conclusive and enforceable U.S.
judgement without substantive re-examination or re litigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results
from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not
contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been
based on an internationally acceptable ground,(d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a
judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered
between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based
on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands and
(e) the judgment is—according to the laws of the country of origin—formally capable of being enforced
(e.g. is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in appeal or its enforceability has not been subjected
to a certain timeframe).

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable
treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from

U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be
enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands
will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency
but enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in


-----

the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands.
Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare
that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only
to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.

**Slovenia**

The United States and Slovenia are not currently party to a treaty for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in accordance with the New York
Convention. Therefore, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by a U.S. federal
or state court based on civil liability would not be directly enforceable in Slovenia. However, a valid
and legally binding judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States may be
recognized and enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction in Slovenia, subject to compliance with
the enforcement procedures set forth in Articles 94 et seq. of the Slovenian Private International Law
and Procedure Act (Zakon o mednarodnem zasebnem pravu in postopku). Following such recognition,
judgments of non-Slovenian courts have the same status and legal effect as those issued by Slovenian
courts.

The Slovenian courts will recognize a U.S. judgment if the judgment is legally binding in the United
States and provided that all of the following conditions are met:

- the matter does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Slovenian court;

- the jurisdiction of the U.S. court was not based solely on the citizenship of the plaintiff, the
property of the defendant in the United States or personal service of the claim to the defendant;

- the U.S. court did not ignore the parties’ agreement on jurisdiction of Slovenian court;

- a Slovenian court has not issued a legally binding decision on the same matter and no other
foreign court decision has been recognized in Slovenia (res iudicata) (and in case of lis pendens
the recognition process is on hold);

- the recognition of the U.S. judgment would not contravene the public policy of Slovenia (ordre
public);

- reciprocity is established (reciprocity is presumed unless proven otherwise; additionally,
absence of reciprocity is irrelevant when recognition or enforcement of a decision by a foreign
court is sought by a Slovenian citizen); and

- there were no procedural irregularities in the proceedings before the U.S. court that prevented
the party against which the judgment was issued to take part in the procedure (no breach of due
process rights).

Subject to the above conditions, Slovenian courts will not review the merits of the foreign judgment.
Slovenian courts also do not review whether the foreign court has acted in accordance with its own
procedural laws— any such issues have to be resolved through an appeal process in that foreign
jurisdiction.

The request for recognition of a U.S. judgment must include the original judgment or a certified copy,
a certificate of finality of the judgment, and a certified translation of the judgment.

If, upon recognition of a U.S. judgment in Slovenia, an opposing party does not pay its debt voluntarily,
a request for enforcement of the judgment must be made. This request must include a certificate of
enforceability of the judgment under the applicable U.S. law.


-----

The international competence of courts and the recognition and enforcement of judgments of competent
courts of a EU Member State (other than Slovenia) are governed by Council Regulation (EC) No.
1215/2012 of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters. In accordance with this regulation, if a court or competent authority so
requires in connection with the recognition and the enforcement of a foreign judgment, a translation of
the relevant documents must be produced and the translation must be certified by a person qualified to
do so in one of the member states. A judgment may not be recognized if its recognition is manifestly
contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought; where it was given in
default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the
proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to
arrange for his defense, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment
when it was possible for him to do so; if it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between
the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought; if it is irreconcilable with an earlier
judgment given in another Member State or in a third state involving the same cause of action and
between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfills the conditions necessary for its
recognition in the Member State addressed; or if it conflicts with Section 6 of Chapter II of the regulation
dealing with exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Member States. Under no circumstances may a
foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance.

In the event of any proceedings being brought in a Slovenian court in respect of a monetary obligation
expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Slovenian court would have power to give
judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the
judgment against any party in Slovenia would generally be available only in euro and for such purposes
all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

**Serbia**

Under the general conflict of laws rules, judgments of non-Serbian courts can be enforced in Serbia
only if they are recognized by a Serbian court.

Recognition of a foreign judgment may be refused if:

- the respondent proves that it was not able to participate in the proceedings, particularly if it
could not have participated in the proceedings because there was no personal service of process;

- the court of Serbia, by virtue of Serbian Law, has exclusive jurisdiction in the relevant subject
matter;

- a Serbian court or other official body has already passed or recognized a decision on the same
subject matter;

- the foreign judgment is found by the Serbian court to be contrary to the “foundations of social
and political order as determined in the Constitution” (i.e. public order);

- if a Serbian court establishes that there is no reciprocity in the matter of recognition and
enforcement of judgments rendered in commercial matters between Serbia and the home
country of the judgment; and

- if the judgment is not final and conclusive (i.e. there are further appeals or revocation
procedures or similar actions have been commenced or are allowed).

From a procedural perspective, a foreign court judgment may be recognized (and further enforced) in
Serbia as part of a separate recognition procedure or as a preliminary question in the regular
enforcement proceedings.

Reciprocity is presumed until proven otherwise, and de facto reciprocity is sufficient.


-----

Serbia is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaty pursuant to which the judgments of U.K. or
U.S. courts would be recognized and enforced. However, U.K. and U.S. court judgments can be
recognized and enforced pursuant to the general rules given above. Factual reciprocity between Serbia
and the U.K. and factual reciprocity between Serbia and the U.S. have been previously confirmed by
the Ministry of Justice but may be re-examined in a particular case if doubts exist as to its continuing
existence. In addition, the Ministry of Justice has not previously confirmed factual reciprocity between
Serbia and individual federal states.

The party seeking recognition/enforcement must submit to the court:

- motion for recognition/enforcement;

- a confirmation by the foreign court that the foreign court’s judgment is final (i.e. that the
judgment cannot be appealed anymore) and enforceable between the parties under the law of
the home country of the judgment;

- the original judgment or its verified copy; and

- a verified Serbian translation of the judgment.

**Bosnia and Herzegovina**

Under the general conflict of laws rules, judgments of non-Bosnian courts can be enforced in Bosnia
and Herzegovina (“BiH”) only if they are recognized by a court in BiH.

Recognition of a foreign judgment may be refused if:

- the respondent proves that it was not able to participate in the proceedings due to procedural
irregularities, particularly if it could not have participated in the proceedings because there was
no personal service of process;

- the court of BiH, by virtue of law of BiH, has exclusive jurisdiction in the relevant subject
matter;

- a BiH court or other official body has already passed or recognized a decision on the same
subject matter;

- the foreign judgment is found by the BiH court to be contrary to the constitution or public policy
of BiH;

- a BiH court establishes that there is no reciprocity in the matter of recognition and enforcement
of judgments passed in commercial matters between BiH and the foreign country in which the
pertinent judgment was passed; and

- if the decision is not final and conclusive (i.e. there are further appeals or revocation procedures
or similar actions have been commenced or are allowed).

Reciprocity is presumed until proven otherwise. However, enforceability of judgments of U.S. or UK
courts in BiH cannot be confirmed. BiH is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaty pursuant to
which the judgments of U.S. or UK courts would be recognized and enforced, and it appears that there
are no cases that have established the principle of “factual reciprocity.”

**Luxembourg**

Each Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all of the managers
and executive officers of the Guarantors incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg are non-residents
of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of each of the Guarantors


-----

incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not
be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the relevant
Guarantors, or to enforce against any of them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an
enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be
enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court
may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the
U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New
Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in
Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

- the U.S. judgment is final and enforceable (“exécutoire”) in the United States;

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective
matter both under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and under applicable
Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules and local law;

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws
rules, or at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules;

- the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under
the laws of Luxembourg or has not been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature
(which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by
Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive
damages)). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered as a penalty,
but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such punitive damages may be
considered as a penalty;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. court submitted to Luxembourg exequatur proceedings does
not contradict a judgment which has been rendered in the forum of the Luxembourg courts;

- the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the U.S.
judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to
appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and

- the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (“fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise”)._

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment,
although there is no statutory prohibition.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law
was not made bona fide and (ii) if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy or is manifestly
incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the
basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to
grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.


-----

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have
power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However, enforcement
of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in Euro and for such purposes
all claims or debts would be converted into Euro.

**Bulgaria**

The United States and Bulgaria are not currently party to a treaty for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in accordance with the New York
Convention. However, a valid and legally binding judgment from a New York court may arguably be
recognized and enforced by a Bulgarian court under the general recognition and enforcement rules of
the Bulgarian Private International Law Code.

The rules under the Bulgarian Private International Law Code verbatim do not restrict the choice of
court arrangements to those of EU member states so it is arguable that choice of the courts of non-EU
member states are covered. However, an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of New York courts may
be unenforceable in Bulgaria due to art. 4, par. 1 of the Brussels Regulation (Recast) which provides
that “subject to this Regulation, persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality,
be sued in the courts of that Member State.” This rule may be interpreted as not permitting choice of
courts arrangements different from those under the Brussels Regulation (Recast) as EU Regulations are
deemed to override any EU member state national laws. We are not aware of any case law of the Court
of Justice of the European Union that sheds light on how choice of New York courts arrangements
should be treated. However, according to current Bulgaria case law, foreign judgements from non-EEA
countries issued following a choice of court in favour of such non-EEA courts, should be upheld
(Judgement No 3978 of 6.07.2020 of Sofia Citi Court under case No 15843/2018 and Judgement No
260632 of 30.12.2020 of Sofia Citi Court under case No 1743/2019). If and as soon as the Hague
Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (which has been ratified by the EU) will
be ratified by the United States (which is a signatory of this convention), this may result in increased
certainty that New York judgements following choice of court in favour of New York courts will be
upheld.

Subject to the above qualification, if it is accepted that the Brussels Regulation (Recast) is not an
obstacle to the application of the Bulgarian Private International Law Code, a New York court
judgement may be recognized and enforced if the following conditions are met:

(i) the New York court had jurisdiction according to the provisions of Bulgarian law, but not if the
only ground for the jurisdiction of the New York court over the dispute was the incorporation
(nationality) of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction of the seized court;

(ii) a copy of the statement of claim was served on the defendant, the parties were duly summonsed,
and the fundamental procedural principles of Bulgarian law, related to their defense have not
been violated;

(iii) there is no Bulgarian court judgment in force based on the same facts, involving the same cause
of action and between the same parties;

(iv) there are no pending proceedings based on the same facts, involving the same cause of action and
between the same parties before a Bulgarian court, which has been brought earlier than the case
instituted before the New York court on which there is judgement whose
recognition/enforcement is being sought;

(v) the recognition or enforcement is not contrary to Bulgarian public policy.

Regarding the first requirement for recognition/enforcement as listed above, i.e., competence of the
New York court under Bulgarian law, there is an express choice of court rule in the Private International


-----

Law Code (applicable also to a choice of court in favor of non-EU member states) whereby the parties
may choose via agreement in writing a foreign (non-Bulgarian) jurisdiction in relation to proprietary
matters provided that the dispute does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bulgarian courts.
As the Brussels Regulation (Recast) takes precedence over Bulgarian domestic private international
law, a choice in favor of New York courts must furthermore not violate the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of other member states if the prerequisites for such exclusive jurisdiction exist under the EU
Brussels Regulation (Recast).

The action for enforcement of a New York judgment must be brought before the Sofia City Court.
Alongside the statement of claim (i.e., the request for recognition and enforcement), the following
documents must be presented:

(i) a certified copy of the judgment, authenticated by the New York court, and

(ii) a certificate issued by the New York court, confirming that said judgment has entered into force.

These documents must be certified in accordance with the Hague Convention Abolishing the
Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents (i.e. the Apostille Convention) and
translated into Bulgarian by a translator certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of
Bulgaria.

The Sofia City Court must of its own motion establish the existence of the conditions for recognition/
enforcement listed above. The defendant in the proceedings for recognition or enforcement of a New
York judgement may not invoke violations of item (ii) of the list above if the defendant could have
raised challenges to such conditions before the New York court but failed to do so. In the
recognition/enforcement proceedings, the Bulgarian court would not examine the merits of the dispute
as decided by the New York court.

The debtor may in the recognition/enforcement proceedings raise the defense that the obligation has
been extinguished on the basis of circumstances that have occurred after the New York judgement
entered into force. The debtor however may not raise the defense that the obligation has been
extinguished as per the preceding sentence if the Bulgarian judgment admitting enforcement has entered
into force.

The judgment of the Sofia City Court in relation to the recognition of a New York court judgment is
subject to appeal before the Sofia Court of Appeals. The decision of the Sofia Court of Appeals is
subject to appeal before the Supreme Court of Cassation. The cassation procedure is conditional on the
prior admission for appeal and the party challenging the appellate judgment should provide evidence
that the statutory grounds for cassation are satisfied. The Supreme Court of Cassation grants the
appellant a leave to appeal before considering the cassation appeal on its merits. The cassation appeal
to the Supreme Court of Cassation does not suspend execution of the judgment of the appellate court.
Thus, the judgment of the Sofia Court of Appeals shall be enforceable and a party may initiate
enforcement proceedings immediately after the judgment of the appellate court.

**Greece**

Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A. is a société anonyme (company limited by shares) incorporated
under the laws of Greece. All of its directors and executive officers reside outside the United States.
Wind Hellas Telecommunications S.A.’s assets and the assets of its directors and executive officers are
located principally in Greece and other countries outside the United States.

Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in Greece,
either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. A final
judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability,
whether or not based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in
Greece on the basis that: (a) the United States is not a member to the Lugano Convention of December


-----

21, 2007, as currently in force; and (b) the United States and Greece currently do not have a treaty
providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in
civil and commercial matters.

Consequently, the recognition and enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in Greece is governed solely
by the provisions of the Greek Code of Civil Procedure, according to which a foreign judgment can be
recognized and declared enforceable in Greece. The enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in Greece
can be effected following a petition of the winning party creditor before the Single Member Court of
First Instance of the debtor’s place of residence.

A final and enforceable judgment in the U.S. courts would be recognized and enforceable by the Greek
courts without re-examination or re-litigation of the matters adjudicated, provided that such judgment
meets the requirements of article 323 of the Greek Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that:

(i) such judgment constitutes res judicata (final judgment) according to the law of the state in which
it was rendered;

(ii) such judgment has been issued by a court having jurisdiction according to Greek law to hear the
particular case;

(iii) the unsuccessful party to the proceedings leading to such judgment has not been deprived of its
rights to participate in such proceedings and defend itself other than by application of the rules
of procedure applicable to nationals of the jurisdiction of the court which rendered the judgment;

(iv) such judgment is not contrary to a previous judgment issued by a competent court of the Hellenic
Republic concerning the same dispute between the same parties and constituting res judicata; and

(v) such judgment is not contrary to the Greek principles of boni mores or public policy.

Further and subject to the provisions of any applicable international treaties, foreign judgments are
recognized and considered as res judicata and enforceable in Greece without further procedure if they
are also res judicata pursuant to the law of the country where they were issued provided that the
conditions under (ii) through (v) above are also met.

If the above conditions are cumulatively met, a final judgment for payment awarded by a court in the
United States can be recognized and declared enforceable in Greece, without being reviewed as to the
merits and with no further procedure. However, as punitive damages are not available under Greek law,
Greek courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages, or decrease such damages
as the Greek courts deem appropriate at the request of the defendant if such damages are considered
disproportionate.

###### Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements 

 to the Shareholders of Adria Midco B.V.

 Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position
of Adria Midco B.V. and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) as of 30 September 2021 and the related
condensed consolidated interim statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the
three-month and nine-month period ended 30 September 2021, changes in equity and cash flows for
the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021 and notes, comprising other explanatory notes.
Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this condensed consolidated
interim financial information in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – ‘Interim
_financial reporting’ as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion_
on this condensed consolidated interim financial information based on our review.

###### Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’. A
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

###### Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – _‘Interim financial reporting’ as_
adopted by the European Union.

###### 1. General information

presented in the note 37.

The Group is one of the largest telecommunication operators in South East Europe providing video, data, voice
and mobile telephone services to residential and business subscribers. The Group has media activities which fall

###### 2. Basis of preparation

 2.1. Statement of compliance

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine and three months period ended 30
September 2021 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting as adopted by EU and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s last annual
consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2020. They do not include all of the information for a full
set of IFRS financial statements. However, the selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and
transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and
performance since the last annual financial statements. These consolidated interim financial statements are not
statutory consolidated financial statements and they are prepared for the purpose of providing information to
owners and providers of financing to the Group.

IFRS requires the management to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances. These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

Certain comparative amounts do not correspond to the 2020 consolidated financial statements and reflect
reclassification adjustments made to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, the following
comparative balances as of 31 December 2020 were reclassified in the consolidated statement of financial
position as of 30 September 2021:

   - Short term provisions in the amount of EUR 2,600 thousand (as of 31 December 2020 EUR 9,433
thousand) are now presented within line Short-term provisions, whilst in consolidated financial
statements as of 31 December 2020 were presented in line Trade and other payables.

The statement of financial position was impacted, but due to the fact that change is not significant for the opening
balance sheet presenting an additional statement of financial position is not considered to be relevant for the
Group.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on
26 November 2021.

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

###### 2.2. Basis of measurement

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the period ended 30 September 2021
have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial instruments, investment
property and assets held for sale.

###### 2.3. Going concern 

The Group has reported a net loss for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021 in the amount of EUR
61,962 thousand (net loss for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020: EUR 33, 438 thousand) which
is mainly attributable to increase in finance cost due to additional bonds issued during 2020 and 2021 (bonds
were used for the acquisition of VIVACOM Group, repayment of a portion of the amounts drawn under the
Revolving Credit Facility that were used to fund the purchase price for the Nova Broadcasting Group Acquisition
and to pay transaction costs associated with the bond offering (note 31)), as well as increase in other operating
expense and income tax expense.

The Group has reported a net loss for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020 in the amount of EUR
33,438 thousand which was influenced mainly by higher finance costs caused by issuing new bonds (note 31).

As at reporting date, the Group reported negative equity in the amount of EUR 46,845 thousand. In October
2021, parent company contributed amount of EUR 19 million in cash which decreased amount of negative
equity. The management is considering actions in order to recover equity. Capital requirements are monitored
on a stand-alone basis and not on the consolidated level and that Adria Midco B.V. has positive equity as at
reporting date.

The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance debt and
the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators is Adjusted Earnings Before
Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (see note 5 for definition). Adjusted EBITDA
for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021 has increased by 83% comparing to the same period for
the 2020. Significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA mainly is result of acquired companies (note 21).

The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports, availability of
financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of budgeted and actual
cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities.

Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments
have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and leases. The Group has
reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 395,302 thousand for the nine-month
period ended 30 September 2021. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they fell due in the normal
course of business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial interest expenses nor any
other liabilities. As at reporting date, the Group has outstanding loans in the amount of EUR 71,848 thousand
and bond liabilities (including interest) in the amount of EUR 3,564,903 thousand which matures from 2024 to
2028. In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of EUR 1,675,000 thousand for the purpose of
acquisition of VIVACOM Group as well as early repayment of one bond tranche and repayment part of the RCF.
These bonds issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028 (note 31). In November 2020, additional bonds
were issued in the amount of EUR 400 million with maturity in 2027 and in January 2021 additional EUR 150
million with the same maturity. In July 2021 the Group issued new bonds in the amount of EUR 300 million with
maturity in August 2028.

As at reporting date the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of EUR 477,085 thousand
(31 December 2020: EUR 353,422 thousand) (note 31).

According to the Group’s business plan for 2021, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase in
Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and working
capital.

The following further forms the basis of management's use of going concern:

11 | P a g e


-----

###### p
 and three months ended 30 September 2021

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

   - The Group has grown its share of the telco and media market in the region.

   - The Group maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no indication
of any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape.

   - The Group is complied with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities as at
reporting date and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of the forecast
period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements). See notes
4 and 31 for further details of the covenants.

Based on the Group’s going concern assessment, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of
the Group for the period ended 30 September 2021 are, therefore, prepared on a going concern basis, as
management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future.

###### 2.4. COVID-19

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from
mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity and it continued to
shape its course in 2021.

Economic development over the coming months will depend on the spread of infection. Vaccines against
COVID-19 became available in December 2020 which substantially reduce the probability of infection.

The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are incorporated into the Group’s
estimates of expected credit loss provisions for financial assets and other impairments assessments in 2021,
including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and Programming rights.

Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s market, operations and
financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial
statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption in the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2021, though the existence
of Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of uncertainty in the wider macro market.

Management concluded that the range of possible outcomes considered at arriving at this judgment does not
give rise to material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of authorization of the financial
statements for issue.

**2.4.1. Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA**

There is positive impact to organic consolidated revenues in 2021 amounts of 6% comparing the same period
last year. The Group recorded iccrease of 3% in organic Adjusted EBITDA comparing to the same period 2020
mainly. The organic means the Group before the acquisitions of Telemach Croatia, VIVACOM Group and
Forthnet Group.

The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and network
operating centre has maintained normal service levels. No significant change in customer database is
experienced during reporting period ended 30 September 2021. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and
decline in revenue from sale of handsets and roaming was mainly offset with decline in churn rate due to
limitation in direct sale to customers. At the same time, the Group has implemented cost savings measures
such as: decrease in travelling, representation and consulting costs.

In its Media segment (organic), external revenue increased by 14% comparing to the same period previous year
mainly as a result of increase in advertising revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, which was highly affected by

12 | P a g e


-----

###### p
 and three months ended 30 September 2021

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

lockdown and state of emergency across the region caused by COVID-19 and sublicensing revenues of
postponed sport events. It is expected that revenues will be on pre-COVID19 level by the end of 2021 and
continuous growth is expected afterwards.

The main reason for decline in Adjusted EBITDA in the Media segment (organic) comparing to nine months
period ended 30 September 2020 is effect of certain contract for carriage fees were not prolonged (expired as
Covid-19 crisis has begun).

**2.4.2. Financing and liquidity**

The Group have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet its financing
obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. During 2021 further measures
were applied by governments however, cash flow was stable during nine months period ended 30 September
2021. As at the date of this report, there is no adverse impact on cash flow.

Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level which resulted in increased
net impairment of trade receivables by EUR 679 thousand, although the Group increased its revenue by 87%
(e.g. EUR 644 million) comparing to the same period previous year.

In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of VIVACOM Group and refinancing
part of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended until 2028. In November 2020
and January 2021 issued bonds were issued for the purpose of repayment part of RCF as well as acquisition
of Nova Broadcasting Group (see note 31).

In July 2021 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of repayment of certain debt and paying purchase price
for Optima Telekom (note 36). In July, the Group agreed on upsizing of existing Senior Secured RCF to EUR
325 million.

Available credit lines at reporting date amounts to EUR 477 million with extended maturity to 2025 (see note
31).

For sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk, please see note 3.3.3.

###### 2.5. Use of estimates and judgments 

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the reporting period require
management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting
policies and the Group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows and disclosure of contingent
assets or liabilities during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors, including industry practices
and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.

The accounting estimates and judgements applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements are the same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2020.

###### 2.6. Functional and presentation currency 

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Company’s
functional currency. Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the
functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are

13 | P a g e


-----

###### p
 and three months ended 30 September 2021

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that
are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are recognized in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

**Foreign operations**

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

   - assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date,

   - income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates
(unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of
transactions) and,

   - the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other
comprehensive income

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.

Exchange rates applied in those consolidated financial statements are as follows:

expected within 12 months of the reporting date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months
from the reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment
and investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current.

Liabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
for at least 12 months after the reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is uncertain,
amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting
date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and employment benefits are reported as non-current.

###### 2.8. New standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards
 mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2021

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting
period commencing 1 January 2021:

###### p
 and three months ended 30 September 2021

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group,
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The finance function monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and
provides top management with feedback regarding the performance of the framework in relation to the risk faced
by the Group.

###### 3.1. Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers, contract
assets, cash and cash equivalents held at banks, loans and financial guarantees issued by the Group and the
indemnification asset.

###### 3.1.1. Exposure to credit risk

The following table represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date:

**30-Sep-21** **31-Dec-20**

Loans to related parties 7,221 6,866

Other financial assets 62,003 54,705

Short term loans to related parties 22,400 
Short term loans receivables and deposits 10,844 9,328

Trade and other receivables 311,041 301,088

Contract assets 57,967 75,536

Cash and cash equivalents 297,455 285,405

**Total** **768,931** **732,928**

###### 3.1.2. Trade and other receivables (including contract assets)

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The
Group assesses that it has no significant concentration of credit risk due to its exposure to a broad customer base
in each service line. No concentration of credit risk on a geographical basis is assessed as material. The Group
has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure for each customer including services disconnection
procedure.

Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s business units which each have policies, procedures and controls
relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly
reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be limited given that
the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and records lifetime
expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for gross trade and other receivables and contract assets at the reporting
date was:

**30-Sep-21** **31-Dec-20**

Provision of service 329,253 317,404

Contract assets 73,706 75,536

Other receivables 16,121 10,802

The aging and impairment of gross trade and other receivables at reporting date is presented in the following
schedule:

**30-Sep-21** **31-Dec-20**

**Gross** **Impairment** **Total** **Gross** **Impairment** **Total**

Not due 302,247 (17,087) 285,160 292,686 (1,158) 291,528

2 to 3 months 7,639 (1,580) 6,059 4,904 (1,090) 3,814

3 to 6 months 8,171 (2,729) 5,442 9,212 (3,140) 6,072

6 to 9 months 6,089 (3,420) 2,669 5,001 (2,009) 2,992

Over 9 months 25,051 (23,823) 1,228 27,294 (16,822) 10,472

**Total** **419,080** **(50,072)** **369,008 403,742** **(27,118)** **376,624**

Due to the large number of customers and the high level of diversification of the trade and other receivables,
including contract assets, the default of any single debtor would not impose any significant consequences in
respect of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the reporting period.

For trade receivables presented in bucket over nine months, for which the Group has liabilities and legal right
to offset them with receivables, no impairment has been recognized. In addition, as at 31 December 2020, for
trade receivables presented in bucket over nine months, in the amount of EUR 9,103 thousand relates to
receivables from stated-owned company which the Group has assessed as collectable as these will be
reimbursed from state budget and subsequently have been collected, no impairment has been recognized.

The contract assets are all not yet due at reporting date. The default rate applied to calculated the expected
credit loss in relation to contract assets is the same as applied to trade receivables not due 0.4%-2.6% (2020:
0.2%-2.6%). In addition, the management assesses impairment of individual contract assets and if concluded
they are uncollectable provision is made based on the management best estimate.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect with trade and other receivables, including contract
assets during period ending 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020 were as follows:

**30-Sep-21** **30-Sep-20**

Opening balance **(27,118)** **(27,798)**

Impairment loss recognized (24,313) (7,895)

Write off of previously impaired receivables 285 7,348

Effect of movements in exchange rates 1,074 (395)

**Total** **(50,072)** **(28,740)**

###### 3.1.3. Other financial assets

A loss allowance in relation to Other financial assets is determined individually for each balance. In order to
assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. Other than what was already provided
in financial statements in previous periods, no other exposure to significant credit risk was identified, so the
calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts for those balances.

Impairment of other financial assets is presented in table below:

 and three months ended 30 September 2021

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

Total amount of long-term loans relates to loan to Totalna Televizija d.o.o. At reporting date, this loan is
considered as non-performing as principal repayments are more than 90 days past due and loss allowance is
based on lifetime expected credit loss.

Under Other financial assets, the Group reported indemnification asset for acquisition of VIVACOM Group in
the amount of EUR 49,238 thousand. Considering the fact that the full indemnification amount is deposited at
banks, the expected credit loss in relation to this indemnification asset as at reporting date was assessed as
not material (note 26).

###### 3.1.4. Short term loans and deposits

A loss allowance in relation to short term loans and deposits is determined individually for each balance. In
order to assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. No exposure to any
significant credit risk was identified, the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts.

###### 3.1.5. Cash and cash equivalents 

The Group holds cash in a number of banks in order to avoid concentration risk. A loss allowance in relation to
cash and cash equivalents is determined individually for each balance with a given financial institution. In order
to assess credit risk, external credit ratings and publicly available information on default rates for a given rating
of Standard & Poor’s rating agency were used. As all cash balances have a low credit risk as at the reporting
date and comparative period, the Group applied the practical expedient available under IFRS 9 and determined
the loss allowances based on 12-month expected credit losses. The calculation of the loss allowances resulted
in an immaterial amount.

The Group held cash and cash equivalents of EUR 297,455 thousand as reporting date (31 December 2020:
EUR 285,405 thousand) with reputable local commercial banks, which represents its maximum credit exposure
on these assets.

Management actively monitors credit risk exposure and given that the Group only has invested in bank deposits
management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

###### 3.2. Liquidity risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due,
which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 31). Typically, the Group seeks to ensure
that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including the servicing of
financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be
predicted, such as natural disasters.

The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are active
only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one. Covenants relating to RCF are monitored
regularly (note 31).

###### 3.3. Market risk 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity
prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing
the return.

###### 3.3.1. Currency risk

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated in
a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or obligation.

Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying economic
conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency, the Group’s
subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”), Croatian kuna (“HRK”), Bosnian
Konvertibilna marka (“BAM”), Bulgarian lev (“BGN”) and Swiss franc (“CHF”). The Bosnia Konvertibilna marka
and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the Euro. Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk relates to purchases
and borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars, while a significant share of the Group’s revenue
is denominated in Serbian dinars, Swiss franc and Croatian kuna.

The Group has exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD (Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it has
significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the functional currency and that has significant
borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this exposure is implemented through regular price
adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation of Serbian dinar against Euro.

The following table presents sensitivities of profit or loss and equity to reasonably possible changes in exchange
rates to EUR applied at the end of the reporting period relative to the functional currency of the respective Group
entities, with all other variables held constant:

###### 3.3.2. Price risk

The Group is not exposed to material price risks on its financial instruments.

###### 3.3.3. Interest rate risk

The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings, loans to related parties issued at
variable rates and lease liabilities, whereas the borrowings at the fixed rate are exposed to fair value risk
nevertheless it does not impact the financial statements as these borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
The Group closely monitors current market rates in order to minimize negative effects of significant movements
in market rates. The Group does not use these instruments for speculative purposes.

As at reporting date, if interest rates on currency denominated borrowings (with floating rate) had been 1%
higher with all other variables held constant, net profit for the year would have been EUR 7,424 thousand lower
(2020: EUR 7,416 thousand).

###### 3.4. Fair value hierarchy

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price in an active
market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency
and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length transactions or
consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain financial instruments for
which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair
value hierarchy as follows:

   - level one is measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities,

   - level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and

   - level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the
measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value
hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.

The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including
their levels in fair values hierarchy. It does not include information for financial assets and financial liabilities not
measured at fair value if the carrying amount if reasonable approximation of fair value.

The fair values of the Other financial liabilities – bonds are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to
net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at reporting date. The valuation basis is level 2.
This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.

###### 4. Capital management 

Due to the structure of long-term financing through leveraged buyout arrangement, the management policy is
to maintain a stable return on investment so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to
sustain future development of the business. The Group’s performance management is focused on generating
budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to repay the financial debt (note 3.2).
An important key performance indicator for the communication with investors, analysts, and rating agencies are
Net leverage (calculated as Net Debt to Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted EBITDA) and Pro Forma Net
leverage (calculated as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA). “Annualised” amounts are calculated by multiplying the amounts for last two quarters by 2. This
standalone ratio stood at 4.61x at reporting date (31 December 2020: 4.58x) and Pro forma ratio stood at 4.65x
at reporting date (31 December 2020: 4.70x).

Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,
Net Debt and Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt are non-GAAP figures not governed by International Financial
Reporting Standards, and their definition and calculation may vary from one company to another.

Net debt and Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted EBITDA are measures prepared by the Group on a Pro
Forma basis and present hypothetically the Group’s Net debt and Annualised Last Two Quarters Adjusted EBITDA
as though the acquisitions of companies (for which the Group acquired during reporting period) and other events
and operations that are directly related to these acquisitions, had taken place at 1 April 2021.

Annualized Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt are measures
prepared by the Group on a Pro Forma basis and present hypothetically the Group’s Adjusted Pro Forma Net
Debt and Annualised Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as though the acquisitions (which the Group
acquired during reporting period), as well as other acquisitions (for which the Group signed agreements for
acquisition and are in process of receiving regulatory approvals) and other events and operations that are directly
related to these acquisitions, had taken place at 1 April 2021.

The unaudited/unreviewed pro forma been prepared solely for management purposes and due to its nature
presents a hypothetical situation; therefore, it does not present the actual results financial results, financial
standing, and any other financial measures of the Group for the presented periods, had the events and operations
discussed really taken place on the assumed dates, and its purpose is not to determine the actual results and
financial standing in any future periods.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (note 15) is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other
entities that operate within these industries.

###### 5.1. Description of products and services from which each reportable segment derives
 its revenue

The Group’s main activities are providing of Video, Data, Voice and Mobile services to subscribers in the

Most of the Group’s business segments are mainly based on the Group’s geographic regions, Serbia, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro, and the media segment is broadly based
on product distribution. They are managed separately because each business unit requires different marketing
strategies and service level.

###### 5.3. Measurement of operating segment profit or loss

The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) reviews financial information prepared based on IFRS adjusted
to meet the requirements of internal reporting. Such financial information differs in certain aspects from IFRS:

   - Management consolidation adjustments can differ from the ones required by IFRS;

   - non-IFRS profit measures (such as earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization – EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Capital Expenditure (Adjusted CAPEX)) are also included in the segment

report. Adjusted CAPEX represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of
set top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labour
costs), cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer

**Total** **(10,328)** **(10,362)** **(2,475)** **(7,385)**

Income tax expense is recognized at the amount determined by multiplying the profit/(loss) before tax for every
component for the interim reporting period by management’s best estimate of the annual income tax rate
expected for the full financial year, adjusted for the tax effects of certain items recognized in the full in interim
period. As such, the effective tax rate in the interim financial statements may differ from management’s estimate
of the effective tax rate for the annual financial statements.

The estimated average tax rate used for the nine-months period ended 30 September 2021 is 24%, compared
to 45% for the nine months ended 30 September 2020. In period ended 30 September 2021 the Group reported
higher loss before tax mainly as a result of increase of operating profit due to acquired companies which was
offset by increase in financing cost due to new financing. Increase in current tax expense is mainly result of full
impact of companies acquired in 2020. Increase in current tax expense was offset by change in deferred tax
benefit. All this resulted in decrease in tax rate for the reporting period, compared to previous period year.

After the date of acquisition, the newly acquired companies contributed consolidated revenue of the Group in total amount of EUR 439,793 thousand and
consolidated net profit in total amount of EUR 26,310 thousand. Following table summarizes effects of acquired companies on consolidated revenue and net
profit.

If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2020, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been EUR 1,727,163 thousand, and
consolidated loss for the period would have been EUR 60,358 thousand. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value
adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2020.

amounted to EUR 3,826 thousand (nine months ended 30 September 2020: EUR 3,138 thousand). There are

Certain management personal can be entitled to LTIS described below.

###### 34.4. Long term incentive scheme (LTIS)

On 27 September 2018, Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC Partners, entered
into a share purchase agreement (“SPA”) to acquire the entire share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Adria
Topco B.V. (the “Target”) from Adria Luxco S.a.r.l. (the “Seller”). The Agreement provided a platform for a
reasonable expectation of the certain management to be awarded based on the performance of the
shareholders in the event of any exit of their investment in Adria Topco or the Group by those shareholders.

The Group has recognized cumulative effect of the Agreement in its consolidated financial statements for the
period ending 30 September 2021, as equity-settled Group Share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2 –
Share-based payment.

From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the period ending 30 September 2021, the
recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the amount of EUR 7,695
thousand. The same amounts of EUR 7,695 thousand, as guided by IFRS 2, the Group recognized an increase
in equity (Contribution from shareholder). The transaction would be a non-cash, no recourse transaction without
an impact on the financial position of the Group.

representing its assessment of the most likely outcome of the cases (note 30) and believes that any disclosure

###### Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Shareholder of Adria Midco BV:

###### Our opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Adria Midco BV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together - the
“Group”) as at 31 December 2020, and the Group’s consolidated financial performance and
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**What we have audited**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

- the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended
31 December 2020;

- the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;

- the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 December 2020;

- the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2020; and

- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include significant accounting policies
and other explanatory information.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the
audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.

**Independence**

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code). We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with the IESBA Code.

###### Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting
process.

###### Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

###### 1. General information

Adria Midco B.V. (the Company) is a company domiciled in Netherlands, registered on 3 October 2013.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2020 comprise the
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). List of subsidiaries is presented in the note
41.

The Group is one of the largest telecommunication operators in South East Europe providing video, data, voice
and mobile telephone services to residential and business subscribers. The Group has media activities which fall
into following categories: content production, distribution, advertising and digital. The Group’s activities are mainly
based in Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece.

On 4 March 2019 Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC Partners completed the
acquisition of majority ownership of the Group following the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.

###### 2. Basis of preparation

This section sets out Group’s significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole and
describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified as having a
potentially material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Where an accounting policy is
generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. Below
are presented the new accounting pronouncements that the Group will adopt in future years and current view of
the impact they will have on the Group’s financial reporting.

###### 2.1. Statement of compliance

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union (EU). These consolidated financial
statements are not statutory consolidated financial statements and they are prepared for the purpose of providing
information to owners of the Group.

IFRS requires the management to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances. These have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

In 2020 the Group changed accounting policy for investment property. This change to significant accounting
policies is described in note 3.

Certain comparative amounts do not correspond to the 2019 consolidated financial statements and reflect
reclassification adjustments made to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, the following
comparative balances as of 31 December 2019 were reclassified in the consolidated statement of financial
position as of 31 December 2020:

   - Interest payable EUR 33,294 thousand (as of 31 December 2019 EUR 26,323 thousand) is now
presented within line Interest payables – bond, whilst in consolidated financial statements as of 31
December 2019 where it was presented in line Trade and other payables.

   - Impairment losses on trade and other receivables, including contract assets and Impairment losses on
other financial assets are renamed in 2020 into Net impairment on trade and other receivables, including
contract assets and Net impairment on other financial assets.

The above change was considered by the Group as a change in accounting policy and in line with IAS 8 it was
applied retrospectively, however due to the nature of the change, the statement of financial position was

10 | P a g e

impacted, therefore presenting an additional statement of financial position is not considered to be relevant for
the Group.

The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 April 2021.

###### 2.2. Basis of measurement

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain
financial instruments, investment property and assets held for sale.

###### 2.3. Going concern 

The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2020 in the amount of EUR 72,426 thousand
(2019: EUR 60,036 thousand) which is mainly attributable to increase in finance cost due to additional bonds
issued during 2020 which was used for the acquisition of VIVACOM Group as well as redemption of existing
bond and partial repayment of revolving credit facility (see note 15).

The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2019 in the amount of EUR 60,036 thousand
which was influenced by several factors including, but not limited to: a share-based payment arrangement
started in 2018 resulting in additional staff cost in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand for 2019 and redemption
fee option for early repayment of bond in the amount of EUR 12,578 thousand.

The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance debt and
the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators are Adjusted Earnings Before
Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (see note 7 for definition). Adjusted EBITDA
for the year ended 31 December 2020 has increased by 47% comparing to the same period for the 2019.
Significant increase in Adjusted EBITDA mainly is result of acquired companies (notes 17, 23).

The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports, availability of
financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of budgeted and actual
cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities.

Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments
have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and leases. The Group has
reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 293,149 thousand for the year ended
31 December 2020. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they fell due in the normal course of
business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial interest expenses nor any other
liabilities. As at 31 December 2020, the Group has outstanding loans in the amount of EUR 2,158 thousand and
bond liabilities (including interest) in the amount of EUR 3,151,735 thousand which matures from 2024 to 2028.
In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of EUR 1,675 million for the purpose of acquisition of
BTC Group as well as early repayment of one bond tranche and repayment part of the RCF. These bonds
issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028 (note 33). In November 2020, additional bonds were issued in
the amount of EUR 400 million with maturity in 2027 and in January 2021 additional EUR 100 million with the
same maturity.

As at 31 December 2020 the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of EUR 353,422
thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 153,246 thousand) (note 33).

According to the Group’s business plan for 2021, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase in
Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and working
capital.

The following further forms the basis of management's use of going concern:

   - The Group has grown its share of the telco and media market in the region.

   - The Group maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no indication
of any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape.

   - The Group is complied with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities as at 31

11 | P a g e

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

December 2020 and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of the forecast
period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial statements). See notes
5 and 33 for further details of the covenants.

Based on the Group’s going concern assessment, the consolidated financial statements are, therefore,
prepared on a going concern basis, as management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

###### 2.4. COVID-19

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly from
mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity and it will continue
to shape its course in 2021.

Many governments across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with a
view to reducing the spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. Currently, the world
is experiencing continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection. The extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic negatively affects business, results of operations and financial condition depends on several factors,
such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in the countries
in which customers are located, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating
conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where the Group operate. Any future developments are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken
by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.

The main priority has been the health and safety of employees and continuous provision of service. The Group
has adhered to instructions issued by the state authorities, including travel restrictions and enforced working
from home. Management believes that the impact on business is currently limited with no immediate material
adverse operational impact. Management intend to continue to follow the various national and/or state
authorities’ policies and, in parallel, intend to do utmost to continue operations as the situation evolves.

Whilst inherently uncertain, and the management expects some impact to operations and performance but
currently does not believe that the COVID-19 outbreak will directly have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
financial condition or liquidity for the foreseeable future such that it is not appropriate to apply the going concern
principal to these financial statements.

The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are incorporated into the Group’s
estimates of expected credit loss provisions for financial assets and other impairments assessments in 2020,
including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and Programming rights.

Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s market, operations and
financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial
statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going concern assumption in the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2020, though the existence
of Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of uncertainty in the wider macro market.

Management concluded that the range of possible outcomes considered at arriving at this judgment does not
give rise to material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of authorization of the financial
statements for issue.

2.4.1. Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA

Negative impact to organic consolidated revenues in 2020 amounts to 1.5% comparing the year ended 31
December 2019. The Group recorded decrease of 2.6% in organic Adjusted EBITDA comparing to the same
period 2019.

The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and network
operating centre has maintained normal service levels. No significant change in customer database is
experienced in 2020. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and decline in revenue from sale of handsets and
roaming was mainly offset with decline in churn rate due to limitation in direct sale to customers. At the same
time, the Group has implemented cost savings measures such as: decrease in travelling, representation and
consulting costs.

In its Media segment, revenue decreased by 14% comparing to the same period previous year. Postponing of
certain sports events effected by reduction of revenue and relevant costs by 9%. Decline in media selling
revenue is offset by decline in relevant costs. All this combined by overall cost optimization efforts resulted in
decrease of 7% in Adjusted EBITDA in Media segment compared to the year ended 31 December 2019.

2.4.2. Financing and liquidity

The Group have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet its financing
obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. During 2020 some countries
declared state of emergency and social distancing rules and store closures which had effect of cash collection
in the first weeks of April. After the easing the measures in May, cash flow stabilised. As at the date of this
report, there is no adverse impact on cash flow.

Certain capex investments, except those necessary for maintaining regular operations, have been postponed.

Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level which resulted in increase of
Net impairment of trade receivables for EUR 924 thousand in comparison to previous year, although the Group
increased its revenue by 50% in 2020.

In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of VIVACOM Group and refinancing
part of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended until 2028. In November 2020
issued bonds were issued for the purpose of repayment part of RCF as well as acquisition of Nova Broadcasting
Group (see notes 33, 40).

Currently available credit lines amount to EUR 360 million with extended maturity to 2025 (see note 33).

For sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk, please see note 4.3.3.

###### 2.5. Use of estimates and judgments 

The consolidated financial statements require management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the Group’s reported financial position,
results or cash flows and disclosure of contingent assets or liabilities during the reporting period. Actual
outcomes could differ from those estimates.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors, including industry practices
and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.

The Group’s critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are detailed in section
**Critical accounting estimates and judgments.**

###### 2.6. Functional and presentation currency 

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Company’s functional currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of

13 | P a g e


-----

###### p y
 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the
functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are
recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that
are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are recognized in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

**Foreign operations**

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

   - assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date,

   - income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates
(unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of
transactions) and,

   - the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other
comprehensive income

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.

Exchange rates applied in those consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Assets are classified as current in the consolidated statement of financial position where recovery is expected
within 12 months of the reporting date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months from the
reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and
investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current.

Liabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
for at least 12 months after the reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is uncertain,
amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting
date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and employment benefits are reported as non-current.

###### 2.8. Financial instruments

**Accounting policies**

Financial instruments (financial assets and financial liabilities) are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial
position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition less any principal
repayments, plus accrued interest, and for financial assets less any allowance for expected credit losses. Accrued
interest includes amortisation of transaction costs deferred at initial recognition and of any premium or discount to
the maturity amount using the effective interest method. Accrued interest income and accrued interest expense,
including both accrued coupon and amortised discount or premium (including fees deferred at origination, if any),
are not presented separately and are included in the carrying values of the related items in the consolidated
statement of financial position.

**Financial instruments – initial recognition**

Financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss are initially recorded at fair value. All other financial
instruments are initially recorded at fair value adjusted for transaction costs. Fair value at initial recognition is best
evidenced by the transaction price. A gain or loss on initial recognition is only recorded if there is a difference
between fair value and transaction price which can be evidenced by other observable current market transactions
in the same instrument or by a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets. After
the initial recognition, an expected credit loss allowance is recognised for financial assets measured at amortized
cost and investments in debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, resulting in
an immediate accounting loss.

All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or
market convention (“regular way” purchases and sales) are recorded at trade date, which is the date on which the
Group commits to deliver a financial asset. All other purchases are recognised when the Group becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument.

**Financial assets – classification and subsequent measurement – measurement categories**

The Group classifies financial assets in the following measurement categories:

  - Fair value through profit and loss,

  - Fair value through other comprehensive income and

  - Amortized cost.

The classification and subsequent measurement of debt financial assets depends on the Group’s business model
for managing the related assets portfolio and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.

**Financial assets – classification and subsequent measurement – business model**

The business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate cash flows – whether the
Group’s objective is:

  - solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets (“hold to collect contractual cash flows”,) or

  - to collect both the contractual cash flows and the cash flows arising from the sale of assets (“hold to
collect contractual cash flows and sell”) or,

  - if neither of above is applicable, the financial assets are classified as part of “other” business model
and measured at fair value through profit and loss.

Business model is determined for a group of assets (on a portfolio level) based on all relevant evidence about the
activities that the Group undertakes to achieve the objective set out for the portfolio available at the date of the
assessment.

15 | P a g e


-----

###### p y
 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

Where the business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to hold contractual cash flows and
sell, the Group assesses whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”).
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash
flows are consistent with the SPPI feature. In making this assessment, the Group considers whether the contractual
cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. interest includes only consideration for credit risk,
time value of money, other basic lending risks and profit margin.

Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that is inconsistent with a basic lending
arrangement, the financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit and loss. The SPPI
assessment is performed on initial recognition of an asset and it is not subsequently reassessed.

Financial instruments are reclassified only when the business model for managing the portfolio as a whole change.
The reclassification has a prospective effect and takes place from the beginning of the first reporting period that
follows after the change in the business model.

**Financial assets – write-off**

Financial assets are written-off, in whole or in part, when the Group exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has
concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The write-off represents a derecognition event. The
Group may write-off financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity when the Group seeks to recover
amounts that are contractually due, however, there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

###### 2.9. New standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards

IFRS 16 (issued on 27 August 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2021).

These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting
periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

###### 3. Change of accounting policy

This note explains the impact of the change of accounting policy for investment property on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements and also discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from
1 January 2020, where they are different to those applied in prior periods.

Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including property under
construction for such purposes). Where the Group uses only insignificant portion of a property it owns for supply
of goods or services or for administrative purposes (utilization of less than 25% is regarded as insignificant) the
property is presented as an investment property.

Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The cost of replacing part of an
existing investment property will be recognized in the carrying amount of an investment property at the time that
cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value in the consolidated financial
statements. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in
profit or loss in Other income/Other operating expense in the period in which they arise.

An investment property is derecognized upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising
on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognized.

**Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs**

The valuation technique used is Market comparison - the fair value is based on the market price of properties
with similar location and category. At the date of valuation, no active market existed and the market value was
determined based on the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
properties. The transactions prices have been adjusted with: market indices to reflect the actual changes in the
offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions; adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of
characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and geomorphologic condition, level of
development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the properties. The estimated fair value of the
individual properties would increase/ (decrease) had the respective market indices were higher/ (lower) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/ (lower).

Prior to change of accounting policy in 2020, the Group measured investment property initially at cost, including
transaction costs. After initial measurement, investment property was measured in accordance with
requirements for cost model depreciating by straight line depreciation over useful life.

Management believes that application of the new policy would result in more reliable and relevant information
as significant acquisition occurred in 2020 (VIVACOM Group). Impact of change of accounting policy on prior
financial reports is assessed as not material and didn’t result in change of comparative period.

###### 4. Financial risk management

This note presents information about the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and
managing credit, liquidity and market risk. Also presents the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to these
risks.

There is no change of financial risk and financial risk management compared to consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2019.

The Group’s managing board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework, and development and monitoring of the Group’s risk management policies.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group,
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The finance function monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and
provides top management with feedback regarding the performance of the framework in relation to the risk faced
by the Group.

###### 4.1. Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers, contract
assets, cash and cash equivalents held at banks, loans and financial guarantees issued by the Group and the
indemnification asset.

4.1.1. Expected credit loss

The Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other
comprehensive income that are subject to the expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash at bank
and in hand and certain other investments are both classified and measured at amortised cost and subject to these
impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial.

The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit loss for debt instruments measured at
amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income and for the exposures arising from loan
commitments and financial guarantee contracts, for contract assets. The Group measures expected credit loss and
recognises net impairment losses on financial and contract assets at each reporting date. The measurement of
expected credit loss reflects:

   - an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible
outcomes,

   - time value of money and

   - all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort at the end of
each reporting period about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions.

Debt instruments measured at amortized cost, trade and other receivables, loans issued and contract assets are
presented in the consolidated statement of financial position net of the allowance for expected credit loss.

The Group applies simplified approach for impairment of trade receivables without significant financing component
and contract assets. For other financial assets the Group applies a three-stage model for impairment, based on
changes in credit quality since initial recognition. A financial instrument that not had a significant increase in credit
risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date is classified in Stage 1. Financial assets
in Stage 1 have their expected credit loss measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime expected credit
loss that results from default events possible within the next 12 months or until contractual maturity, if shorter (“12
Months expected credit loss”). If the Group identifies a significant increase in credit risk (“SICR”) since initial

18 | P a g e


-----

###### p y
 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

recognition, the asset is transferred to Stage 2 and its expected credit loss is measured based on expected credit
loss on a lifetime basis, that is, up until contractual maturity but considering expected prepayments, if any (“Lifetime
expected credit loss”). If the Group determines that a financial asset is credit-impaired, the asset is transferred to
Stage 3 and its expected credit loss is measured as a Lifetime expected credit loss. For financial assets that are
purchased or originated credit-impaired (“POCI Assets”), the expected credit loss is always measured as a Lifetime
expected credit loss.

Range of expected rates applied to trade receivables as at 31 December 2020 and 2019 are presented in table
below:

Range in 2020 Range in 2019

not due 0.4%-4.7% 0.2%-4.7%

Up to 1 month 0.74%-4.7% 0.74%-4.70%

1 to 2 months 0.2%-11.3% 0.2%-11.3%

2 to 3 months 2.5%-26.5% 2.5%-26.5%

3 to 6 months 10.33%-44.4% 10.33%-44.4%

6 to 9 months 24.9%-100% 24.9%-100%

Over 9 months 100% 100%

The non-recoverability analysis is conducted for the past 3 years to determine the general default ratio. In order to
determine the default rate for a given ageing interval, the balance of receivables written-off is compared against the
balance of outstanding receivables.

4.1.2. Exposure to credit risk

The following table represents the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date:

**31-Dec-20** **31-Dec-19**

Loans to related parties 6,866 5,980

Other financial assets 54,705 1,013

Short term loans receivables and deposits 9,328 8,115

Trade and other receivables 301,088 148,185

Contract assets 75,536 28,127

Cash and cash equivalents 285,405 250,058

**Total** **732,928** **441,478**

4.1.3. Trade and other receivables (including contract assets)

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The
Group assesses that it has no significant concentration of credit risk due to its exposure to a broad customer base
in each service line. No concentration of credit risk on a geographical basis is assessed as material. The Group
has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure for each customer including services disconnection
procedure.

Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s business units which each have policies, procedures and controls
relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly
reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be limited given that
the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and records lifetime
expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit
risk at the reporting date was:

**Total** **403,742** **(27,118)** **204,110** **(27,798)**

Due to the large number of customers and the high level of diversification of the trade and other receivables,
including contract assets, the default of any single debtor would not impose any significant consequences in
respect of the consolidated financial statements. For trade receivables presented in bucket over nine months,
for which the Group have liabilities and legal right to offset them with receivables and receivables in the amount
of EUR 8,747 thousand from stated-owned company which the Group has assessed as collectable as these will
be reimbursed from state budget, no impairment has been recognized.

The contract assets are all not yet due as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019. The default rate
applied to calculated the expected credit loss in relation to contract assets is the same as applied to trade
receivables not due 0.4%-2.6% (2019: 0.2%-2.6%).

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect with trade and other receivables, including contract
assets during period ending 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 was as follows:

**31-Dec-20** **31-Dec-19**

Opening balance **(27,798)** **(17,820)**

Impairment loss recognized (11,335) (10,411)

Write off of previously impaired receivables 12,599 1,158

Effect of movements in exchange rates (584) (725)

**Total** **(27,118)** **(27,798)**

4.1.4. Other financial assets

A loss allowance in relation to Other financial assets is determined individually for each balance. In order to
assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. Other than what was already provided
in financial statements in 2019, no other exposure to significant credit risk was identified, so the calculation of
the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts for those balances.

**Allowance for credit losses on other financial assets** **(12,187)** **(12,187)**

Total amount of long-term loans relates to loan to Totalna Televizija d.o.o. At 31 December 2019 this loan is
considered as non-performing as principal repayments are more than 90 days past due and loss allowance is
based on lifetime expected credit loss.

Under Other financial assets, the Group reported indemnification asset for acquisition of VIVACOM Group in
the amount of EUR 49,237 thousand. Considering the fact that the full indemnification amount is deposited at
banks, the expected credit loss in relation to this indemnification asset as at 31 December 2020 was assessed
as being not material (note 28).

4.1.5. Short term loans and deposits

A loss allowance in relation to short term loans and deposits is determined individually for each balance. In
order to assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. No exposure to any
significant credit risk was identified, the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial amounts.

4.1.6. Cash and cash equivalents

The Group holds cash in a number of banks in order to avoid concentration risk. A loss allowance in relation to
cash and cash equivalents is determined individually for each balance with a given financial institution. In order
to assess credit risk, external credit ratings and publicly available information on default rates for a given rating
of Standard & Poor’s rating agency were used. As all cash balances have a low credit risk as at the reporting
date and comparative period, the Group applied the practical expedient available under IFRS 9 and determined
the loss allowances based on 12-month expected credit losses. The calculation of the loss allowances resulted
in an immaterial amount.

The Group held cash and cash equivalents of EUR 285,405 thousand as 31 December 2020 (31 December
2019: EUR 250,058 thousand) with reputable local commercial banks, which represents its maximum credit
exposure on these assets.

Management actively monitors credit risk exposure and given that the Group only has invested in bank deposits
management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

###### 4.2. Liquidity risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due,
which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 33). Typically, the Group seeks to ensure
that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due, including the servicing of
financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be
predicted, such as natural disasters.

The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are active
only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one. Covenants relating to RCF are monitored
regularly (note 33).

thousand which was redeemed in February 2020 (note 33).

###### 4.3. Market risk 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity
prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing
the return.

4.3.1. Currency risk

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated in
a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or obligation.

Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying economic
conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency, the Group’s
subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”), Croatian kuna (“HRK”), Bosnian
Konvertibilna marka (“BAM”), Bulgarian lev (“BGN”) and Swiss franc (“CHF”). The Bosnia Konvertibilna marka
and Bulgarian lev are pegged to the Euro. Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk comes from relates
to purchases and borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars, while a significant share of the
Group’s revenue is denominated in Serbian dinars, Swiss franc and Croatian kuna.

The Group has exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD (Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it has
significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the functional currency and that has significant
borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this exposure is implemented through regular price
adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation of Serbian dinar against Euro.

The following table presents sensitivities of profit or loss and equity to reasonably possible changes in exchange
rates to EUR applied at the end of the reporting period relative to the functional currency of the respective Group
entities, with all other variables held constant:

4.3.2. Price risk

The Group is not exposed to material price risks on its financial instruments.

4.3.3. Interest rate risk

The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings, loans to related parties issued at
variable rates and lease liabilities, whereas the borrowings at the fixed rate are exposed to fair value risk
nevertheless it does not impact the financial statements as these borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
The Group closely monitors current market rates in order to minimize negative effects of significant movements
in market rates. The Group does not use these instruments for speculative purposes.

As at 31 December 2020, if interest rates on currency denominated borrowings (with floating rate) had been 1%
higher with all other variables held constant, net profit for the year would have been EUR 7,416 thousand lower
(2019: EUR 4,289 thousand).

###### 4.4. Fair value hierarchy

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price in an active
market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency
and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length transactions or
consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain financial instruments for
which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value measurements are analysed by level in the fair
value hierarchy as follows:

   - level one are measurements at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities,

   - level two measurements are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and

   - level three measurements are valuations not based on solely observable market data (that is, the
measurement requires significant unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value
hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.

The table below shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including
their levels in fair values hierarchy. It does not include information for financial assets and financial liabilities not
measured at fair value if the carrying amount if reasonable approximation of fair value.

The fair values of the Other financial liabilities – bonds are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to
net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 December. The valuation basis is level 2.
This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly.

###### 5. Capital management 

Due to the structure of long-term financing through leveraged buyout arrangement, the management policy is
to maintain a stable return on investment so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to
sustain future development of the business. The Group’s performance management is focused on generating
budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to repay the financial debt (note 4). An
important key performance indicator for the communication with investors, analysts, and rating agencies is Pro
Forma Net leverage (calculated as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted
Pro Forma EBITDA). “Annualised” amounts are calculated by multiplying the amounts for last two quarters by
2. This pro forma ratio stood at 4.7x at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 4.71x).

Annualized Last Two Quarters Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma Net Debt are non-GAAP
figures not governed by International Financial Reporting Standards, and their definition and calculation may
vary from one company to another. These measures are prepared by the Group on a Pro Forma basis and
present hypothetically the Group’s adjusted net debt and Annualised Last two Quarters adjusted EBITDA as
though the acquisition of VIVACOM Group (control obtained on 3 August 2020), Forthnet Group (control obtained
on 12 November 2020) and Nova Broadcasting Group (acquired on 22 January 2021) and other events and
operations that are directly related to these acquisitions, had taken place at 1 January 2020.

The unaudited/unreviewed pro forma been prepared solely for management purposes and due to its nature
presents a hypothetical situation; therefore, it does not present the actual results financial results, financial
standing, and any other financial measures of the Group for the presented periods, had the events and operations
discussed really taken place on the assumed dates, and its purpose is not to determine the actual results and
financial standing in any future periods.

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for investors and to maintain an optimal liquidity position.

###### 6. Critical accounting estimates and judgments 

Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial
statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year included:

###### 6.1. Revenue recognition 

Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data, use
of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting
judgements and source of estimation uncertainty are disclosed below.

6.1.1. Gross versus net presentation

The Group is the principal in the sale to the customer if the Group has control of the goods and services when
they are delivered to a customer; otherwise the Group is acting as an agent. Whether the Group is considered to
be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and
substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount
of reported revenue and operating expenses (see notes 8 and 9) but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or
cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for
example, those where the Group delivers advertising and media selling services. Please refer to sections 8.3
and 8.4 for accounting policy.

6.1.2. Allocation of revenue to goods and services provided to customers

The Group is determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the
contract; the allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be obtained
if the promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction. The standalone selling prices
are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells handsets and telecommunication services, if
sold separately.

###### 6.2. Business combinations and goodwill

When the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities
acquired, including intangible assets, are recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and
liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement. If the purchase consideration exceeds
the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If the
purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded
as a gain in the income statement.

Allocation of the purchase price between property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill affects
the subsequent results of the Group as finite lived assets are amortised, whereas goodwill is not. Please refer to
note 23 for further information.

###### 6.3. Impairment of goodwill

IFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets, for finite lived assets
and for equity accounted investments, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. Impairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets
can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating the net present
value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including
management’s expectations of:

   - growth in Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in note 7),

   - timing and amount of future capital expenditure;

   - long-term growth rates; and

32 | P a g e


-----

###### p y
 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

   - discount rates to reflect the risks involved.

Management prepares formal five-year budget for the Group’s operations, which are used to estimate their value
in use. Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the adjusted EBITDA and growth rate
assumptions used in the cash flow projections, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and
hence reported assets and profits or losses (note 19).

###### 6.4. Customer relationships

The Group tests annually useful life of customer relationships based on management assumptions on customer
churn rates. An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an increase in the
amortisation charge.

###### 6.5. Lease accounting

Lease accounting under IFRS 16 increases use of management judgements and estimates to provide financial
information.

###### 6.6. Lease identification

The Group exercises judgement to determine whether or not a contract contains a lease. In addition, judgement
is exercised to determine which incremental borrowing rate to apply to obtain the present value.

###### 6.7. Lease term

In determining the lease term, management considers all fact and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. The assessment is reviewed
if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is
within the control of the Group.

###### 6.8. Contingent liabilities

The Group exercises judgement to determine whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent
liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation,
arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities (Note 38). Judgement is necessary to
assess the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise.

###### 6.9. Expected credit loss

The calculation and measurement of expected credit loss in relation to trade receivables and contract assets is
an area where significant judgement is required to select an appropriate methodology, models and data inputs.
Details of expected credit loss measurement methodology are disclosed in note 4 Expected credit losses. In the
calculation of the default rate, the Group’s models predominantly use historical information which is derived from
the Group’s systems of market data.

###### 7. Operating segments

The Group is a pan regional distribution platform of cable and satellite Pay-TV, broadband internet and
telephony services with various offerings in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Greece, Montenegro and North Macedonia. Its business has grown substantially in terms of scale, geographic
reach and service offering during the period under review through both organic growth and acquisitions. In
addition, the corporate organization of the Group’s business has changed during this period as business has
grown and been integrated.

Segment information is provided partially on the basis of geographic areas and partially based on an
organizational structure, being the basis on which the Group manages its operations.

**Accounting policies**

An operating segment is a component of the Group:

- that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses that relate to
transactions with any of the Group’s other components,

- whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM)
and

- for which discrete financial information is available.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM.
CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

Operating segments are components that engage in business activities that may earn revenues or incur
expenses as a result of the services provided. Operating results of segments are regularly reviewed by the
CODM and discrete financial information is available on that level. Revenue in telco segments is attributed to a
country based on the location of the sub-group reporting the revenue.

The functions of CODM are performed by the Managing directors of the Group.

The Group has seven operating segments in telecom and one in media business line, which are the Group’s
strategic divisions. Telecom strategic divisions for each of key markets, offer similar services and are managed
jointly since they have unified service development and marketing strategy. Media segment represents content
operating. For each of the strategic divisions, the CODM reviews internal management reports on at least
monthly basis. The reportable segments equal the operating segments thus no aggregation of operating
segments was performed for the reporting purposes.

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments.

   - Serbia Group includes cable operations in Serbia and DTH (satellite TV) operations in Macedonia.
Satellite operations in Macedonia account for minor part of the overall operations of Serbia Group
segment,

   - Bulgaria Group includes telecom operations in Bulgaria,

   - Slovenia Group includes cable and DTH operations and mobile telephony services in Slovenia (note 23),

   - Greece Group includes telecom and media operations in Greece (note 23),

   - Bosnia Group includes cable and DTH operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

   - Montenegro Group includes cable and DTH operations in Montenegro,

   - Croatia Group includes mobile telephony services in Croatia (note 23),

   - Media Group includes media (including advertising) and content operations in the region. This segment
includes the results of our media and content business in the former Yugoslav region including the results
of N1 Info, Grand Production, Orlando Kids, Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH, as well as Direct Media.

   - Other segments include our other operating business, such as Solford, Shoppster and non-operating
holding companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria Serbia Holdco B.V., Slovenia Broadband
S.A.R.L.). Revenue reported in other is mainly generated by Solford and Shoppster.

In 2020, the Group completed following acquisitions which represent separate segments:

   - Telemach Hrvatska d.o.o., mobile operator in Croatia which represents separate segment Croatia Group.

   - VIVACOM Group, telco operator in Bulgaria which represents Bulgaria Group.

   - Forthnet Group, telco and media operator in Greece which represents Greece Group.

There were no changes in relation to composition of segments and measurement of segment profit/loss
comparing to consolidated financial statements for 2019.

Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured
based on segment earnings before net finance cost, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted
EBITDA, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s management.

EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance
with IFRS. “EBITDA” is defined by the Group as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income tax (benefit)/expense,
depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and net finance costs and share of profit/loss of equity-accounted
investee.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for shareholder-related costs, legal and advisory – M&A related
costs, group restructuring costs, income from the disposal of companies, impairment charges for obsolete

###### 7.2. Factors that management used to identify the reportable segments

Most of the Group’s business segments are mainly based on the Group’s geographic regions, Serbia, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro, and the other business segment is
broadly based on product distribution. They are managed separately because each business unit requires
different marketing strategies and service level.

###### 7.3. Measurement of operating segment profit or loss

The CODM reviews financial information prepared based on IFRS adjusted to meet the requirements of internal
reporting. Such financial information differs in certain aspects from IFRS:

   - Management consolidation adjustments can differ from the ones required by IFRS;

   - non-IFRS profit measures (such as earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization – EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Capital Expenditure (Adjusted CAPEX)) are also included in the segment
report. Adjusted CAPEX represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets, consisting primarily of
set top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure, installations (including capitalized labour
costs), cable and mobile network build out, upgrades, maintenance and other investments, computer
hardware and software and content rights.

CODM evaluates performance of each segment based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and other key
performance indicators (e.g. average revenue per user, CAPEX) and does not regularly review assets and
liabilities of the segments.

###### 8. Revenue

**Accounting policies**

The Group’s process for revenue recognition from multi-element contracts (e.g. mobile service and handset)
consists of:

   - assessment of all goods and services provided to the subscriber under the contract and identifying
separate performance obligations in that contract,

   - determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the contract; the
allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be obtained if
the promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction.

In determining the transaction price, the Group shall adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of
the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly)
provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the
customer. In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing component. However, based on the
management analysis and considered factors noted in IFRS 15.61, at present, the financing component is
considered to be immaterial of handset and would not materially change the amount of revenue that should be
recognized in relation to a contract with a customer and thus, there is no need to determine the present value of
future cash flows from handset to calculate the initial value of the contract asset. The Group will continue to monitor
contract offerings and mobile business models.

###### 8.1. Subscription fee revenues 

Revenue from subscription services consists primarily of monthly fees paid by subscribers for provision of
telecommunication service. These revenues are recognized within the profit or loss in proportion to the length
service provided (subscription fee) over time in the period when related services are rendered.

The Group generates following main subscription-based service revenue streams which are recognized in the
period when the service is provided: Cable TV (CATV), Digital TV (D3), cable and fibre Internet service, satellite TV
(Direct to Home - DTH) and mobile telephony service.

Revenues from the rendered services relate to mobile services containing amounts charged to post-paid plan
customers for monthly service fees, which includes: voice, data and SMS.

41 | P a g e


-----

###### 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

Based on IFRS 15, revenue should follow performance and not timing of payment, as the Group has obligation to
provide service to the customer. The revenue is recognized over time and only to the extent of provided service,
and remaining of the consideration received is deferred. Mobile phone service is a “stand ready obligation” and the
obligation is satisfied by passage of time so the fixed monthly fee is spread straight line over the time of the contract.
The fee charged additionally for telephone conversation and SMS is a variable consideration which is recognized
as revenue when the even usage giving rise to such fee occurs.

Handsets subsidized represents a distinct performance obligation and realization of revenues to each performance
obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is required. The subsidy of the hardware leads to the
recognition of a contract asset under IFRS 15. The total consideration allocated to this performance obligation based
on the relative stand- alone selling prices of performance obligations within this contract and amount accrued at this
point is recognised as contract asset. The IFRS 15 adjustment results in revenue recognition from the sale of
hardware at the contract inception and the recognition of contract asset in the balance sheet. During the minimum
contract duration (e.g. two years) contract asset is settled from the monthly service fee paid by the customer.

The Group uses the practical expedient under IFRS 15 and recognizes fee from voice, data and SMS in the amount
to which the Group has a right to invoice.

###### 8.2. Carriage fees

Carriage fee revenue relates to sales of pay-tv channel to other cable operators. The Group is the owner of paytv channels including brands like “Sport Klub”, regional news channel 'N1', general entertainment channel Nova
S, movie channel “Cinemania”, children channels “Pikaboo” and ”Vavoom“ and music channels “Grand” and
“IDJ”, as well as terrestrial TV stations Nova TV and Doma TV in Croatia, Nova M in Montenegro and Nova BH
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Revenue is recognized over the time, depending on a contract, either on straight-line basis over the sales
contract period when the fixed fee is contracted or number of subscribers multiplied by agreed price per user.

###### 8.3. Advertising revenue

Advertising revenue is derived primarily from broadcasting of advertising content and is recognized over the time
when the advertising is broadcast. Revenue is recognized in profit or loss in the amount due from customers net of
value added tax and any rebates granted, which is highly probable that it will not be reversed. Please refer to note
6.1 for information on critical estimates and judgements.

###### 8.4. Media selling 

Media selling revenue relates to selling of advertising space in any communication platform, such as newspapers,
magazines, outdoor billboards and screens, event sponsorship, commercial radio or television, business
information/data and online/digital. The Group acts as principal in media selling (note 6). Media selling revenue is
recognized over the time of providing the service. Please refer to note 6.1 for information on critical estimates and
judgements.

###### 8.5. Revenue from sale of end user equipment

Revenue from sale of end user equipment is recognized at point in time when the control is transferred to the buyer
which usually is the moment when the customer obtains the end user equipment. End user equipment mainly
relates to handsets.

###### 8.6. Other revenue

Other revenue mainly arises from lease of cable network and represents lease component accounted for under
IFRS 16, revenue from digital distribution, other media related service and other services from customers.

The Group applies IFRIC 23 in assessment of uncertain tax position. The Group determines whether to consider
each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments based on
which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. In determining the approach that better predicts
the resolution of the uncertainty, an entity might consider, for example, (a) how it prepares its income tax filings
and supports tax treatments; or (b) how the entity expects the taxation authority to make its examination and
resolve issues that might arise from that examination.

In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profit (tax loss),
tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, the Group assumes that a taxation authority will
examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making those
examinations. When the Group concludes it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax
treatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax
credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings.

When the Group concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment,
the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused
tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax
treatment by using either of the following methods, depending on which method the entity expects to better
predict the resolution of the uncertainty:

   - the most likely amount—the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The most likely
amount may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if the possible outcomes are binary or are
concentrated on one value.

   - the expected value—the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes. The
expected value may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if there is a range of possible
outcomes that are neither binary nor concentrated on one value.

When uncertain tax treatment affects current tax and deferred tax (for example, if it affects both taxable profit
used to determine current tax and tax bases used to determine deferred tax), the Group makes consistent
judgements and estimates for both current tax and deferred tax.

SBB and Telemach d.o.o., Slovenia are entities which primarily utilise tax losses and use tax holiday for
investments in plant and equipment. During 2016, SBB managed to satisfy conditions to apply for another 10
years cycle of tax holiday, i.e. to employ 100 employees and invest more than EUR 8.5m. In 2020, SBB is
utilizing the tax holiday which reduces its nominal income tax liability by 70%, and which expires in 2025.

SBB is eligible for investment incentives (tax holiday) according to Article 50a to 50i Serbian Corporate Income
Tax (CIT). For SBB this is a second use of this type of investment tax credit. The company met required
conditions to use an investment tax credit for the second time in 2016. The investment tax credit is applied for
ten years. Start of investment in fixed assets for the second investment tax credit is 1 January 2016. Each year
the proportion for this investment needs to be calculated. Calculation of this percentage represent the ratio of
investment in fixed assets that meet requirements from Serbian CIT art 50a to 50i (certain assets need to be
excluded such as aircraft and watercrafts, passenger cars, furniture and assets that hasn’t been paid during the
cumulative period) and total investment in fix assets (for period from 1 January 2016 - according to invested
amount in fixed assets and for previous period according to fixed amount of assets book value). The percentage
which can be apply as investment tax credit on calculated CIT is changing every year.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses, because it is more likely than not that
future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom. Overview of

###### 18. Property, plant and equipment

**Accounting policies**

Property, plant and equipment comprise mainly cable network (coaxial and optical primary and secondary
network and backbone) and customer premise equipment (CPE - receivers and modems). Items of property,
plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed
assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets
to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the
site on which they are located and capitalized borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the
functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

50 | P a g e


-----

###### 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment, and is recognized net
within other income or other operating expenses in profit or loss.

###### 18.1. Subsequent costs 

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Cost of replacing major parts or components of
property, plant and equipment items are capitalised and depreciated over shorter of remaining useful life of
an asset or period until major part are replaced again. Cost of the replaced part is retired. All other repairs
and maintenance are recognized in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

###### 18.2. Depreciation 
Depreciation is based on the depreciable amount of an asset. Significant components of individual assets
are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that
component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
component of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives for the current and
comparative periods are as follows:

Number of years

Buildings 30 – 40

Cable network 10 – 20

Vehicles 4 – 5

CPE (Head-end and optical equipment) 3 – 5

Computer equipment 3 – 5

###### 18.3. Impairment of property plant and equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The impairment losses recognized in respect of property, plant and equipment may be reversed in a later period
if the recoverable amount becomes greater than the carrying value, within the limit of impairment losses
previously recognized. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Assets that suffered
impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
###### 18.4. Capital commitments

During the period ended 31 December 2020, the Group entered into agreement to buy property, plant and
equipment for EUR 44,654 thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 4,479 thousand). Delivery is expected during
2021.

###### 19. Goodwill

**Accounting policies**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition (as defined in the note 23) over the fair value
of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured
at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. This impairment test is performed to compare the recoverable amount of each Cash
Generating Unit (CGU) or, if necessary in cases of goodwill, CGU to the carrying value of the CGU
(including goodwill, if goodwill has been allocated to CGU or group of CGUs). A CGU is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other assets or groups of assets.

The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the discounted value of future cash
flows (Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) by using cash flow projections consistent with the budget of
the following year, the most recent forecasts prepared by the operating segments and long-term
projections.

Applied discount rates are determined by reference to available external sources of information, usually
based on financial institutions’ benchmarks, and reflect the current assessment by the Group of the time
value of money and risks specific to each asset or group of assets. Perpetual growth rates used for the
evaluation of CGUs are those used to prepare budgets for each CGU or group of CGUs, and beyond the
period covered, are consistent with growth rates estimated by the business by extrapolating growth rates
used in the budgets, without exceeding the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the
group operates. The fair value (less costs to sell) is the price that would be received from the sale of an
asset or group of assets in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date,
less costs to sell. These values are generally determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices
or comparison with similar listed companies, with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in
recent transactions) or, in the absence of such data, on the basis of discontinued cash flows. If the
recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of an asset or group of assets, an impairment loss
equal to the difference is recognized in statement of profit and loss. In the case of a group of assets, this
impairment loss is first recorded against goodwill. Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill
cannot be reversed at a later date.

CGUs are independently defined at each business level, corresponding to the group operating segments. An
impairment test of goodwill is performed by the Group for each CGU or group of CGUs, depending on the level
at which management measures return on operations.

The following schedule summarizes the movements in the balance of goodwill:

###### Impairment testing for goodwill 

In 2021, the Group tested the value of goodwill allocated to its CGUs or groups of CGUs applying valuation
methods consistent with previous years. Results of an impairment test show that the recoverable amount of
CGU or groups of CGUs tested exceeded their carrying value (including goodwill), except for the Montenegro
Group where the impairment of EUR 890 was recognised. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher
of the value in use determined by the discounted value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow method
(DCF)) and the fair value (less costs to sell), determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices,
comparable listed companies, comparison with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent
acquisition transactions).

Definition of the Group’s CGU or group of CGUs correlates to the Group’s operating segment.

The recoverable amount of each operating segment is determined using value-in-use calculations. These
calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on five-year financial budget. Cash flow beyond the fiveyear period is calculated on a perpetuity basis. The post -tax cash flows were discounted using the post-tax rate
to ensure consistency.

###### 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

Based on analysis, Montenegro Group would not be able to grow with the growth rates expected in the past. As
a result of impairment testing. impairment of goodwill in Montenegro in the amount of EUR 890 thousand was
recorded in 2020.

###### Key assumptions used for discounted cash flow projections

Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are weighted average cost of capital, terminal
value growth rate, budgeted Adjusted EBITDA growth rate and budgeted Adjusted EBITDA margin. These
assumptions are presented in table below:

**2020** **2019**

**Bulgaria Group**

Revenue growth in the period covered by the budget 4.2% n/a

Average budgeted Adjusted EBITDA margin 42.2% n/a

Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA growth rate 2021-2025 7.3% n/a

Terminal value nominal growth rate 2.0% 2.0%

WACC 10.3% 9.6%

1 Weighted average cost of capital, calculated on post-tax basis

WACC is calculated as weighted average of post-tax cost of equity and post-tax cost of debt, using peer groups’
capital structure as weights, betas used are post-tax and based on industry reports as of 31 December 2020
and leveraged by the debt margin taken from comparable companies. Assumptions used for value-in-use
calculations (refer to the above table) changed to reflect current business environment as more information
became available to the Group.

The cash flow projections included specific estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter, except
for Forthnet Group where extended period was included in order to normalize cash flows in years 2026 to 2030
to converge to profitability of the market participant within 5 years. The terminal growth rate was determined
based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual Adjusted EBITDA growth rate, consistent
with the assumptions that a market participant would make.

Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA was estimated considering past experience, adjusted as follows:

   - Revenue growth was projected considering the growth levels over the past three years and market
research for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five
years.

   - Corporate costs not included in individual CGU. Therefore, it shows the cash outflows from the continuing
use of the assets.

###### Sensitivity analysis

The management has identified that there are no reasonably possible changes in a key business and valuation
assumptions in Bulgaria Group, Serbia Group, Slovenia Group and Croatia Group which could cause the
carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

For Greece Group, if WACC would increase for 1.5% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount
by EUR 11,447 thousand.

For Bosnia Group, if WACC would increase for 2% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount by
EUR 3,998 thousand.

For Media Group, if WACC would increase for 1.5% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount by
EUR 1,660 thousand.

###### 20. Intangible assets

**Accounting policies**

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when satisfy the conditions for recognition as an asset. All
other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in
profit or loss as incurred.

**Trademarks**

Trademarks are acquired in a business combination, recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks
are amortized over their useful lives.

Trademarks include following trade names: “SBB”, “Total TV”, “Telemach”, “Sport Klub”, “Nova TV”, “Direct Media”,
Vivacom and Nova (Greece).

**Customer relationships**

Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
The customer relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses.

**Radio frequency rights**

Property rights relates to rights to radio frequencies for mobile services. The company uses the cost model and
thus manages intangible assets at their purchase values less depreciation adjustments following the straight-line
amortization method. Any intangible assets that meet the conditions for recognition are valued at cost upon initial
recognition. Property rights are amortized in a period of 2-10 years.

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when satisfy the conditions for recognition as an asset. All other
expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as
incurred.

**Computer software**

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Software is recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Cost includes
expenditure to acquire software and directly attributable costs to prepare it for its intended use.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the relevant criteria
are satisfied:

   - the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale.

   - its intention to complete the software and use or sell it.

   - its ability to use or sell the software.

   - how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

   - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to
use or sell the software.

   - its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the software during its development.

Directly attributable costs, capitalized as part of the software product, includes software development

58 | P a g e

###### 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

employee cost and appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not
meet these criteria are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognized as an
expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer software development costs
recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

**Subscriber acquisition cost**

Subscriber acquisition costs include additional costs associated with entering into sales contracts with new
customers, for example commissions paid to internal or external sales personnel. Subscriber acquisition costs
are recognized only for costs that are incremental to obtaining the contract.

**Programming rights**

When entering into contracts for the acquisition of film, series, shows or sports events, the rights acquired are
classified as contractual commitments. The Group assesses each license agreement which span over period
longer than one year whether it meets definition of an intangible asset and recognition criteria. They are
recorded in the statement of financial position and classified as programming rights as follows:

   - Programming rights for films and television series are recognized at cost when the program is available
for screening and are expensed over their broadcasting period.

   - Sports rights are recognized at cost at the opening of the broadcasting period of the related sports season
start or contract date if season start is not defined in the contract itself. If the licence agreement spans
over more than one year, the Group will recognize programming rights only to the level of assets available
for broadcasting (e.g. one season).

   - Own-produced programming rights are capitalized on the balance sheet at cost which are directly related
to the project being developed such as direct external development costs, allocated costs of employees
and development overhead pool directly attributable to preparing the asset for use and will be amortized
based on program viewership forecast method

Advance payments for acquired programming assets, prior to licence begin date, are recognized as
prepayments for programming assets.

Signed and binding contracts for purchase of programming, which do not meet recognition criteria for
programming assets are not recognized in the balance sheet and are instead disclosed as contractual
commitments in the amount of the outstanding contract liability at the reporting date.

**Amortization**

Amortization is based on the depreciable amount of an asset and is calculated using straight-line method (except
for own-produced programming rights, see below) to allocate their cost over their estimated useful lives.

Useful life of these assets is presented in table below:

**Number of years**

Trademark 15

Customer relationship 5 – 11

Programming rights (other than own production) Over contract duration period

National frequencies 6.8 – 7.4

Subscriber acquisition cost 2 – 12

Radio frequencies 2 – 10

Software & licenses 3 – 5

The useful lives of customer relations are estimated through valuation exercise using the income approach
based upon current market conditions.

59 | P a g e


-----

###### 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

Own-produced programming rights are amortised based on program viewership forecast method using following
rates 80% in the first run and remaining 20% in further runs.

The amortization charge for programming rights for each period are recognized in profit or loss statement as
amortization of programming rights.

Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.

**Impairment of intangible assets**

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The impairment losses recognized in respect of intangible assets may be reversed in a later period if the
recoverable amount becomes greater than the carrying value, within the limit of impairment losses previously
recognized. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Assets that suffered impairment,
are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**Assets provided as security for loans**

As at 31 December 2020 revolving facility is guaranteed by pledge on trademarks (“SBB” and “Total TV”).
Carrying value of intangible assets under pledge as at 31 December 2020 amounts to EUR 15,299 thousand
(31 December 2019: EUR 17,156 thousand).

**Capital commitment**

During the period ended 31 December 2020, the Group entered into agreements to buy intangible assets for
the amount of EUR 125,983 thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 32,872 thousand) which manly relates to
programming rights. Delivery is expected during the period of next five years.

###### 22. Right of use and lease liability

The Group recognises new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of satellite, office facilities, part of
infrastructure, as well base stations and the right of use of a water and land surface.

**Accounting policies**

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange of consideration.

Leases are recorded as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset
is available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments for the right of use the underlying
asset during the lease term:

   - Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;

   - Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;

   - Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

   - The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option;

   - Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined,
otherwise the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is applied. Weighted average incremental borrowing rates
used in 2020 was 5.2%.

There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items available on the voluntary
basis. The Group has elected to apply those exemption therefore the payments associated with all short-term
leases and leases of a low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.
Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment,
computers, mobile phones etc.

Right-of-use assets are measured initially comprising the following:

   - The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

   - Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received,

   - Any initial direct costs,

   - Restoration costs.

63 | P a g e

###### p y

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

Subsequently, the right-of-use asset measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses, and adjusted for reassessment of the lease liability due to reassessment or lease
modifications. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term
on a straight-line basis.

Useful lives for right-of-use asset as per asset classes are as follows:

**Number of years**

Land and properties 2 – 23

Machinery and equipment 5 – 30

Satellite transponder 6

Office premises 2-20

Optic fibers 2 – 15

Motor vehicles 1 – 4

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or
loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.

**As a lessor**

Where the Group is a lessor in a lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership to the lessee, the assets leased out do not present identifiable assets, though it is used by the Group
as well, e.g. cable network.

###### 23. Business combinations

**Accounting policies**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business combination
is measured as the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value,
fair value of any previously held interest and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity.
For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity is measured either at their
proportionate share of the acquired entity’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date or fair value.
Consideration transferred includes any contingent consideration measured at its acquisition date fair value. The
consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such
amounts are generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability
will be recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive
income. Contingent consideration that qualifies for classification as equity is not re-measured until it is finally
settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.

Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill in
the consolidated statement of financial position. If the cost is lower than the identifiable net assets acquired, the
difference is recognized in profit or loss.

Please refer to note 6.2 for information on critical estimates and judgements.

###### 27. Contract assets and liabilities

The contract assets arise mainly from:

   - the sales of the subsidised handsets – the revenue is recognised when the customer obtains the handset
whereas the payment is obtained over the period for which the customer has committed the mobile
services which usually is two years.

   - uneven payments relating to discounts provided to customers, including free services rendered for
contract commitments (e.g. free add-ons given to customers at contract inception for the duration
unequal to minimum contract duration (MCD)). This service is expected to be delivered the customer
for the duration agreed at contract inception and represents a dissimilar separate performance
obligation which is not delivered concurrently with main services throughout the MCD,

   - services provided but not billed (accrued revenue at reporting date).The contract assets are transferred
to receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group issues an
invoice to the customer.

The contract liability is mainly recognised in relation to advertising, media selling, carriage fee and subscription
due to payments received at the inception of the contract whereas the revenue is recognised over time.

**Accounting policies**

The Group’s contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after
allowances for future expected credit losses (see note 4.1.3 for more information on credit risk).

###### 32. Provisions

**Accounting policies**

A provision is a liability recognized in the statement of financial position, when the Group has a present obligation
(legal or constructive) as a result of past events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for
future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the managements’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation
at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Where the timing of
settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12
months from the reporting date.

The main provisions the Group holds are related to decommissioning costs associated with mobile sites, which
include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the end of the lease and
claims for legal and regulatory matter.

###### 32.1. Decommissioning

A provision has been recognised for decommissioning costs associated with mobile sites. The provision has
been capitalized to the cost of the sites with the amount of the present value of the expected decommissioning
obligation after ceasing operation. The discount rates used for 2020 and 2019 were between 0.6% and 1.1%.
The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of decommissioning of the assets
to which they relate, and are long term in nature.

###### 32.2. Legal and regulatory

The Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notifications of possible claims. The
management, after taking legal advice, have established provisions after taking into accounts the facts of each
case. For a discussion of certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 38.

###### 33. Borrowings and bonds

**Accounting policies**

Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are
subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial
instrument. An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the transaction had not taken place.
Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents (including employees acting as selling agents),
advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and transfer taxes and
duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or internal administrative or
holding costs.

The effective interest method is a method of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period,
so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest (effective interest rate) on the carrying amount. The effective
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts (excluding future credit
losses) through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, if appropriate, to the gross carrying
amount of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate discounts cash flows of variable interest instruments
to the next interest repricing date, except for the premium or discount which reflects the credit spread over the
floating rate specified in the instrument, or other variables that are not reset to market rates. Such premiums or
discounts are amortised over the whole expected life of the instrument. The present value calculation includes all
fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. For assets
that are purchased or originated credit impaired (“POCI”) at initial recognition, the effective interest rate is adjusted
for credit risk, i.e. it is calculated based on the expected cash flows on initial recognition instead of contractual
payments.

Upon origination of the bonds and RCF, transaction costs were included in the financial liabilities recognized.
Interest expense recorded includes amortization of these transaction costs deferred at initial recognition to
maturity amount using the effective interest method. Amortized transaction costs are not presented separately
and is included in the carrying values of the borrowings (as a reducing item).

###### 35. Deferred tax assets and liabilities

**Accounting policies**

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognized for:

   - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss,

   - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the
extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

   - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can
be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when
they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities
and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or
on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax
assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year is presented in the following table:

amounted to EUR 3,960 thousand (2019: EUR 3,099 thousand). There are no post-employment and termination
benefits for the members of the management.

Key management personnel obtain also the Long-term incentive bonus described below.

###### 37.4. Guarantee

The Group had guaranteed a loan of the other related party Gerrard Aircraft GMBH (31 December 2019: EUR
2,814 thousand) which expired on 13 April 2020.

###### 37.5. Long Term Incentive Scheme

On 16 May 2018, the shareholders of ultimate holding company, Adria Luxco S.à r.l. (Adria Luxco), entered into
a Long-Term Incentive Scheme (the “LTIS Agreement”) pursuant to which certain members of management will
be compensated in an amount determined by reference to the performance of the shareholders of Adria Luxco
in the event of any exit of their investment in Adria Luxco or Group by those shareholders. The Agreement
provided a platform for a reasonable expectation of the management to be awarded based on the performance
of the shareholders in the event of any exit of their investment in Adria Luxco or the Group by those shareholders.

General Terms and Conditions of the LTIS Agreement included:

   - an obligation of the shareholders of Adria Luxco, conditioned upon a predetermined accumulated return
on invested capital (measured by money-multiple and internal rate of return tests) in the event of any exit
of their investment in Adria Luxco or Group, to award a bonus payment to existing management of the
Group;

   - the amount of the bonus payment calculated as a percentage of the proceeds received by the
shareholders of Adria Luxco and based on above mentioned accumulated return on invested capital
achieved by such shareholders;

   - the payment of exit proceeds earmarked for the bonus payment is to be made by each shareholder to
an intermediary vehicle in cash within 30 days of receipt of such exit proceeds, with no recourse to the
Group, including the ultimate holding company Adria Luxco; no stock options or other derivative financial

###### 2020

In thousands of EUR unless otherwise stated

instruments are part of the LTIS Agreement;

   - no company in the Group, including the ultimate holding company Adria Luxco, has any obligation under
the LTIS Agreement to settle the bonus payment to the management. The LTIS is funded/settled in its
entirety by the Group’s external shareholders.

On 27 September 2018, Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC Partners, entered into
a share purchase agreement (“SPA”) to acquire the entire share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Adria
Topco BV (the “Target”) from Adria Luxco S.a.r.l. (the “Seller”). The consummation of the Group Acquisition
pursuant to the Group Share Purchase Agreement which was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including clearance by competition authorities concluded on 4 March 2019. The consummation of the Group
acquisition represented an Exit under the LTIS Agreement.

The Group has recognized the effects of the LTIS Agreement in its consolidated financial statements for the
period ending 31 December 2019, as equity-settled Group Share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2 –
Share-based payment – as LTIS Agreement is structured in a Group context where multiple Group entities
receive services from employees. It also provides the responsibility of shareholders to settle the bonus (sharebased payment) to employees who are providing services to several group companies.

The bonus amount under the LTIS Agreement at closing amounted to EUR 54,468 thousand, which relates to
the period of services provided from the LTIS Agreement signing to the grant date when all parties will have
shared understanding of key conditions pertaining LTIS Agreement. The service period ended 31 August 2019.
The Group recognized in its consolidated financial statements for the period ending 30 September 2019 and 31
December 2019 related expense in the amount of EUR 21,659 thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand,
retrospectively which corresponds to the eligible managers’ period of service from LTIS Agreement signing to the
end of the reporting period.

From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the periods ending 30 September 2019 and 31
December 2019, the recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the
amount of EUR 21,659 thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively. The same amounts of EUR 21,659
thousand and EUR 21,659 thousand, retrospectively, as guided by IFRS 2, the Group recognized an increase in
equity (Contribution from shareholder). The transaction is a non-cash, no recourse transaction without an impact
on the financial position of the Group.

###### 37.6. Additional payment 

In addition to the LTIS Agreement, the shareholders of Adria Luxco and management have agreed an additional
payment for 2019 in the amount of 49,9 million EUR. The amount of the additional payment was not directly
related to the value of the Company’s equity, or that of its ultimate parent, and was not paid in securities, but
was determined as a result of negotiations as a discretionary lump sum amount paid in cash to the management
at closing.

The Group believes that this additional payment could be regarded as a short-term employee benefit under IAS
19, however, it is the Group’s accounting policy, where external shareholders have the obligation of settling the
payment for such benefits, without recourse from the Group, and absent an IFRS requirement, not to attribute
related expense to the consolidated financial statements.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

As at 31 December 2020, the Group is involved in a number of legal cases in the total amount claimed of EUR
541,558 thousand (31 December 2019: EUR 182,242 thousand).

The Group management recognized provisions for legal cases in the amount of EUR 27,420 thousand
representing its assessment of the most likely outcome of the cases (note 32) and believes that any disclosure
of the amounts provided on a case-by-case basis could seriously harm the Group’s position, but provides details
of the provisions recorded by categories of litigation as reflected below. Ultimate outcome of the cases is
inherently uncertain and may differ from the best estimate of the Group management as discussed below.

presented litigations which could have significant impact on the Group.

###### 38.1. Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD’s previous Shareholder Litigation

Certain previous direct and indirect shareholders of the seller of VIVACOM Group have initiated legal
proceedings in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg which relate to the ownership of shares in VIVACOM
Group. Certain other legal proceedings in relation to VIVACOM Group and its previous share ownership and
obligations in Bulgaria have been resolved.

The Group acquired VIVACOM’s shares in an arm’s length transaction for fair market value pursuant to a public
auction process organized by a reputable financial advisor. It is unlikely to have an adverse impact on the Group
or the VIVACOM Group.

###### 38.2. Legal cases in Serbia 

**Dispute with BS Group d.o.o., Brus in Regard to Producer’s Rights**

In 2016, BS GROUP DOO BRUS (‘‘BS’’) initiated legal proceedings against the Serbia Broadband – Srpske
kablovske mreže d.o.o. (SBB) before the Commercial Court in Serbia, claiming damages in the amount of
approximately EUR 25 million. BS claims that SBB violated BS’s producer rights in respect of certain of its
television series and films by broadcasting them outside of Serbia. SBB has responded to the claims.
Subsequently, a court expert report dated as of December 6, 2019, concluded that broadcasts had occurred
outside of Serbia. SBB submitted comments made by its own expert challenging the court expert’s report. The
Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that would adversely
impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised.

In September 2019, JKP Beogradske elektrane raised legal case against SBB. Subject of the dispute is
indemnity for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 10,000 thousand. Plaintiff also
seek to impose an obligation on SBB Serbia to remove the network or to pay the Beogradske elektrane a fee in
the amount of EUR 100 million, which represents an amount designated by the Beogradske eletrane and, as
such, should not be directly enforceable against SBB as the payment thereof represents only an alternative
option for SBB Serbia to be allowed to maintain the network in case the court rules that the network should be
removed. The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that
would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised.

**Unfair competition claims by Telekom Srbija**

In December 2020 and early 2021, Telekom Srbija started proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court
and Zurich Commercial Court against several entities belonging to the Group in relation to the alleged acts of
unfair competition against the plaintiff. In both proceedings Telekom Srbija argues that it suffered prejudice as
a result of defamatory statements allegedly made by the defendants in relation to Telekom Srbija’s business
operations.

In its proceedings before the Belgrade Commercial Court Telekom Srbija is suing SBB d.o.o., United Media
Digital d.o.o., Adria News S.à.r.l. and United Group B.V. and is claiming damages of approximately EUR 80
million. In its proceedings before the Zurich Commercial Court the plaintiff is suing United Media Network AG;
United Group B.V., United Media S.à.r.l., and Adria News S.à.r.l. and is claiming damages of approximately
CHF 1.35 million.

The Group considers that both courts do not have jurisdiction to review these claims and that, in any event,
these claims are without merits and are not supported by any evidence. The proceedings before both courts
are ongoing.

**Investigation of Tax Authority in Serbia**

In investigation of Tax Authority in Serbia, which resulted in decision issued in March 2019 claiming that
recharacterized interest payments made by SBB Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain other
transactions) as dividends, which would have been subject to a 5% withholding tax. Ministry of Finance accepted
appeal and annulled the Tax Administration's decision requiring SBB to pay approximately EUR 21 million in
additional taxes for the years 2012-2016. iThe decision now instructs the Tax Administration to repeat the
procedure taking into account SBBs arguments. No provision for this uncertain tax position has been recognised
as management has assessed that it is probable that it will sustain the tax treatment applied by the Group.

###### 38.3. Legal cases in Slovenia 

**Administrative matters**

The award of 5 MHz on 2100 MHz spectrum frequency within its 3G licenses in 2008 to Tušmobil (now Telemach
Slovenia) is currently subject of judicial review before the Administrative Court against the decision issued by
the Slovenian Agency for Communication Networks and Services (“Agency”). In court, Telemach Slovenia is
challenging Agency’s decision of May 2019, by which the Agency in the renewed frequencies allotment
procedure has rejected Tušmobil’s request for allocation of said radiofrequencies and reversed its allotment
decision of 2008, coming into the effect as of 31 December 2019. Based on Telemach Slovenia’s proposal, in
June 2019, the Administrative Court issued an interim injunction and therewith stayed the Agency’s decision of
May 2019 until the court reaches a final decision on Telemach’s lawsuit against Agency’s decision of May 2019.
The procedure before the Administrative Court concerning the Telemach Slovenia’s lawsuit is pending. Loss of
the described frequency licence would lead to capacity reduction, which might cause decrease in quality of

service in certain areas. However, additional frequencies granted in 2016 (and currently used by Telemach
Slovenia) would support the Group to mitigate the impact of any potential loss of 3G frequencies due to a
renewal of the licence allocation procedure or other revocation or impairment of the 3G license that was granted
in 2008. In a spectrum auction that took place in April 2021, Telemach Slovenia successfully bid for frequency
bands.

**Disputes with SAZAS Relating to Infringement of Copyrights**

From 2012 onwards, the Slovenian Association of Composers and Authors (“SAZAS”) commenced many legal
proceedings against all cable operators in Slovenia (including Telemach Slovenia) claiming infringement of
copyrights and damages for the cable retransmission of musical works. SAZAS initiated numerous legal
proceedings against Telemach Slovenia claiming copyright remuneration for cable retransmission of music
works.

The proceedings are in different stages, as the proceedings that began in 2012 are currently considered by the
Constitutional Court, while the proceedings that were initiated in 2020 are pending before either the first instance
court or the Higher Court. In all these cases, the Group filed legal means against the courts' decisions. The
procedures are pending.

On 4 March 2021, the Copyright Board issued its decision setting a tariff for the use of music works at EUR 0.24
per subscriber per month for retransmission of up to 100 television and 60 radio channels, and EUR 0.27 per
subscriber per month for retransmission of more than 100 television and 60 radio channels. The Group
challenged the Copyright Board decision in court.

**Sport Klub Divestiture Ruling and Investigation of Alleged Abuse of Dominant Position**

In September 2018, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency ruled that the Group’s acquisition of United
Media Distribution (then IKO Balkan) in 2012 is incompatible with competition rules. The Slovenian Competition
Protection Agency (hereinafter - the Agency) ordered the Group to divest the activity of broadcasting Sport Klub
(SK) TV channels within nine months and imposed a ban prohibiting the Group from broadcasting sports TV
channels in Slovenia for three years from the date of divestment (with the exception of the existing Fight
Channel).

In October 2018, the Slovenian Supreme Court issued our proposed interim injunction and stayed the
implementation of the Agency’s divestment decision until a final decision on the merits of this case has been
issued. The lawsuit against the divestment decision is pending. In addition, in a separate misdemeanour
proceeding a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the Group could be imposed for each
of the next two breaches: (i) filing of concentration notification to the Agency with delay and (ii) breaching of the
stand still obligation.

In May 2019, the Agency issued decision on misdemeanour procedure by which financial fine in the amount of
EUR 3.7 million was imposed. The Group appealed against the decision and seek to annul or change decision
in order to abolish the financial fine or at least lower it. In January 2021, the Administrative court ruled the fine
in the amount of EUR 1.56 million. The Group appealed this ruling and requested a further reduction in the
amount of the fine.

In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated a proceeding regarding the abuse of
dominant market position by United Media Limited, IKO Balkan (now United Media Distribution) and its
Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. (former subsidiary of the IKO Balkan - liquidated in 2016) in the
wholesale market for the supply of pay TV sports channels in Slovenia for a period beginning around August
2012. This proceeding is currently still in its initial stages as no statement of objections has been issued by the
Slovenian Competition Protection Agency. If the Agency in this procedure ruled that the dominant position

**Minority shareholders of Kablovska Televizija HS d.o.o., HKB-net d.o.o.**

As a result of acquisition of subsidiaries in Bosnia, the Group assumed significant number of ongoing court
disputes. The disputes are initiated by the minority owners of companies Kablovska Televizija HS d.o.o. and
HKB-net d.o.o. which claimed compensation for damages and cancellation of a share purchase transaction.
The cases have been filed against majority owners of Kablovska Televizija HS d.o.o. and HKB-net d.o.o. for
breaching minority shareholders’ rights. The provisional quantum of indemnity sought by the minority
shareholders is up to EUR 12,200 thousand (including penalty interest rates and costs of the proceedings),
which is determined, according to the Group legal advisors, solely by plaintiffs. Based on the advice from legal
advisors, the Group management has set aside funds in escrow account for the purpose of settlement of cases.

During 2020, the Group acquired:

   - VIVACOM Group (including following companies Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD, Bulgarian
Telecommunications Company EAD, NURTS Bulgaria EAD, NURTS Digital EAD, BTC Net EOOD and
Net Is Sat EOOD), representing Bulgaria Group,

   - Forthnet Group (including following companies Forthnet S.A., Forthnet Media S.A., Intervision services
B.V., NetMed N.V. and NetMed S.A., Greece), representing Greece Group,

   - I.R.V. d.o.o. (included under Media Group),

   - EVJ promet d.o.o., Elcatel d.o.o.,Ansat d.o.o. (included in Slovenia Group),

   - Panel d.o.o. (included in Serbia Group) and

d.o.o.

For details on acquired companies in 2019 and 2020 please see note 23.

The new subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019, apart from the acquired ones, are established by the Group.

**Accounting policies**

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing
rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company’s returns and exposure or
rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year
are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective
date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the
Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the
original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder’s share of changes in equity since the date
of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results
in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

The Group applies the economic entity model to account for transactions with owners of non-controlling interest in
transactions that do not result in a loss of control. Any difference between the purchase consideration and the
carrying amount of non-controlling interest acquired is recorded as a capital transaction directly in equity. The Group
recognises the difference between sales consideration and the carrying amount of non-controlling interest sold as
a capital transaction in the statement of changes in equity.

###### Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Shareholders of Adria Midco BV

###### Our opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Adria Midco BV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together – the
“Group”) as at 31 December 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union.

**What we have audited**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

- the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 31
December 2019;

- the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019;

- the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;

- the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and

- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include significant accounting policies
and other explanatory information.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the
audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.

**Independence**

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code). We have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.

###### Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting
process.

###### Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

**a)** **Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union (EU). The Group applied the
same accounting policies in the preparation of the financial data for the year ended 31 December 2019,
except for the EU-endorsed standards and interpretations which are effective for the reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. These consolidated financial statements are not statutory
consolidated financial statements and they are prepared for the purpose of providing information to
owners of the Group.

This is the first set of the Group’s consolidated financial statements where IFRS 16 has been applied.
Changes to significant accounting policies are described in note 4.

The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 April
2020.

**b)** **Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
derivative financial instruments and certain financial instruments.

**c)** **Going concern**

The Group has reported a net loss for the year ended 31 December 2019 in the amount of EUR 60,036
thousand (2018: EUR 45,999 thousand) which was influenced by several factors including, but not
limited to: a share-based payment arrangement started in 2018 resulting in additional staff cost in the
amount of EUR 21,659 thousand for 2019 and redemption fee option for early repayment of bond in the
amount of EUR 12,578 thousand.

The Group generated net loss for the year ended 31 December 2018 in the amount of EUR 45,999
thousand which was influenced by the introduction of new a share-based payment arrangement in 2018
resulting in additional staff expense in the amount of EUR 32,809 thousand, impairment of goodwill in
the amount of EUR 9,255 thousand and a legal and advisory fees for M&A in the amount of EUR 17,681
thousand.

The expansion of the Group is based on a leveraged buyout strategy resulting in an increased finance
debt and the associated net finance expenses. The Group’s key performance indicators are adjusted
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) (note 17). Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2019 has increased by 13% comparing to the same period for
the 2018 (note 17).

The Group regularly (daily and monthly) analyses liquidity projections, internal financial reports,
availability of financial assets and ability to repay its liabilities through daily and/or monthly review of
budgeted and actual cash flows and monitoring of maturity of the Group’s receivables and liabilities.

Primary sources of the Group’s liquidity and funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
investments have been operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, ancillary lending facilities and
leases. The Group has reported net cash inflow from operating activities in the amount of EUR 162,621
thousand for the year ended 31 December 2019. The Group was able to repay its obligations when they
fell due in the normal course of business with no defaults in repayment of debt, the associated financial

15

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

interest expenses nor any other liabilities. As at 31 December 2019, the Group has outstanding loans in
the amount of EUR 92,301 thousand and bond liabilities in the amount of EUR 1,654,900 thousand
which matures from 2022 to 2025. In February 2020, the Group issued bonds in the amount of EUR
1,675,000 thousand for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group as well as early repayment of one bond
tranche and repayment part of the RCF. New bonds issuance is with maturity date in 2026 and 2028
(note 40).

As at 31 December 2019 the Group has an undrawn revolving credit line in the amount of EUR 153,246
thousand (note 32).

According to the Group’s business plan for 2020, the Group will continue to grow and expects increase
in Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide sufficient ground for financing debt, capital expenditures and
working capital.

**COVID-19**

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly
from mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity. Many
governments across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with a
view to reducing the spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. The Group
considers this outbreak to be a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.

The main priority has been the health and safety of employees and continuous provision of service. The
Group has adhered to instructions issued by the state authorities, including travel restrictions and
enforced working from home. Management believes that the impact on business is currently limited
with no immediate material adverse operational impact. Management intend to continue to follow the
various national and/or state authorities’ policies and, in parallel, intend to do utmost to continue
operations as the situation evolves.

Management has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The results of management review of the Group’s
market, operations and financials in the past year and a forecast for at least twelve months after the date
of signing of the financial statements provides a sound basis for the appropriateness of using the going
concern assumption in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31
December 2019, though the existence of Coronavirus (COVID-19) means there is generally a level of
uncertainty in the wider macro market.

_Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA_

Based on analysis performed, negative impact to organic consolidated revenues could amount to 2-3%
comparing to previous year. The management expect to mitigate revenues shortfall by cost optimisation
to still record a slight organic EBITDA growth comparing to previous year.

The Group’s telco segments have continued to meet customers’ expectations on service level and
network operating centre has maintained normal service levels. Based on this, no significant change in
customer database is expected. Negative effect of increase in bad debt and decline in revenue from sale
of handsets will be offset with decline in churn rate as well as measures for cost savings whilst
maintaining its ability to operate effectively.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

In its Media segment, the management expects decline in revenue by approximately 4-5% comparing to
previous year. Postponing of certain sports events effected by reduction of revenue and relevant costs.
Decline in media selling revenue will be offset by decline in relevant costs. All this combined by overall
cost optimization efforts should result in stable Adjusted EBITDA in Media segment compared to
previous year.

_Financing and liquidity_

The Group expects to have sufficient cash reserves and cash generated for the forecast period to meet
its financing obligations. Net working capital is regularly monitored at each component level. Certain
capex investments, except those necessary for maintaining normal operations, have been postponed.
Efforts have been made to keep collection of receivables at highest possible level however, the
management anticipates increase in impairment loss on trade receivables up to 3million in comparison
to previous year.

In February 2020 the Group issued bonds for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group and refinancing
part of existing debt by which interest rates decreased and maturity was extended well beyond 2021.

In addition to currently available credit lines, after the closing of acquisition of the BTC Group, the
Group will have RCF in the total available amount of EUR 250 million (note 40).

The following further forms the basis of management's use of going concern:

- The market is growing, and the business has grown its share of the overall market.

- The business has grown its revenues, gross profit margins, Adjusted EBITDA margins and operating
cash flows over the year, when compared to the prior period on an annualized basis.

- The business maintains a high level of business ethics and regulatory compliance and there is no
indication of any foreseeable material adverse change in the regulatory landscape.

- The Group is in compliance with the covenants related to the listed bonds and senior credit facilities
as at 31 December 2019 and expects to remain compliant with these covenants over the duration of
the forecast period (being for at least twelve months after the date of signing of the financial
statements). Refer to note 32 for further details of the covenants.

Based on the Group’s going concern assessment outlined above, the consolidated financial statements
are, therefore, prepared on a going concern basis, as management have a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

**d)** **Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Company’s functional
currency. All financial information presented in Euros has been rounded to the nearest thousand. Items
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).

**e)** **Use of estimates and judgments**

The consolidated financial statements require management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

17


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.

**3.** **Significant accounting policies**

**a)** **Basis of consolidation**

**_Business combinations_**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business
combination is measured as the fair value of the aggregate consideration transferred, measured at acquisition
date fair value, fair value of any previously held interest and the amount of any non-controlling interest in
the acquired entity. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity is
measured either at their proportionate share of the acquired entity’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition
date or fair value. Consideration transferred includes any contingent consideration measured at its
acquisition date fair value. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement
of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive
income.

Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or
liability will be recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other
comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that qualifies for classification as equity is not remeasured until it is finally settled. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.

Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill
in the consolidated statement of financial position. If the cost is lower than the identifiable net assets
acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss.

**_Subsidiaries_**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to,
or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control
ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them
with the policies adopted by the Group.

**_Loss of control_**

Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any noncontrolling interests and translation gains/losses accumulated in equity related to the subsidiary. Any
surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognized in profit or loss. If the Group retains any
interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is
lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee if the significant influence or joint
control is retained or otherwise as financial asset measured at fair value.

**_Transactions eliminated on consolidation_**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized gain and losses arising from intra-group
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

**_Purchases and sales of non-controlling interests._**

The Group applies the economic entity model to account for transactions with owners of non-controlling
interest in transactions that do not result in a loss of control. Any difference between the purchase
consideration and the carrying amount of non-controlling interest acquired is recorded as a capital
transaction directly in equity. The Group recognises the difference between sales consideration and the
carrying amount of non-controlling interest sold as a capital transaction in the statement of changes in
equity.

**b)** **New standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards mandatory for the first**

**time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2019**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for its annual financial
statements commencing 1 January 2019:

- IFRS 16 Leases

- Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation – Amendments to IFRS 9

- Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures – Amendments to IAS 28

- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015 – 2017 Cycle

- Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement – Amendments to IAS 19

- Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.

The Group had to change its accounting policies as a result of adopting IFRS 16. The group elected to
adopt the new rules retrospectively but recognised the cumulative effect of initially applying the new
standard on 1 January 2019. This is disclosed in note 4. The other amendments listed above did not have
any impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the
current or future periods.

**c)** **Standards issued but not yet adopted**

Certain new standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for the annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2020 or later, and which the Group has not early adopted.

Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture – Amendments to
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (issued on 11 September 2014 and effective for annual periods beginning on or
after a date to be determined by the IASB). These amendments address an inconsistency between the
requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28 in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between
an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full
gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognised
when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are held by a
subsidiary.

IFRS 17 "Insurance Contracts"(issued on 18 May 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2021). IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4, which has given companies dispensation to carry on
accounting for insurance contracts using existing practices. As a consequence, it was difficult for
investors to compare and contrast the financial performance of otherwise similar insurance companies.
IFRS 17 is a single principle-based standard to account for all types of insurance contracts, including
reinsurance contracts that an insurer holds. The standard requires recognition and measurement of
groups of insurance contracts at: (i) a risk-adjusted present value of the future cash flows (the fulfilment
cash flows) that incorporates all of the available information about the fulfilment cash flows in a way
that is consistent with observable market information; plus (if this value is a liability) or minus (if this

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

value is an asset) (ii) an amount representing the unearned profit in the group of contracts (the contractual
service margin). Insurers will be recognising the profit from a group of insurance contracts over the
period they provide insurance coverage, and as they are released from risk. If a group of contracts is or
becomes loss-making, an entity will be recognising the loss immediately.

Amendments to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (issued on 29 March 2018 and
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The revised Conceptual Framework
includes a new chapter on measurement; guidance on reporting financial performance; improved
definitions and guidance ‒ in particular the definition of a liability; and clarifications in important areas,
such as the roles of stewardship, prudence and measurement uncertainty in financial reporting.

Definition of a business – Amendments to IFRS 3 (issued on 22 October 2018 and effective for
acquisitions from the beginning of annual reporting period that starts on or after 1 January 2020). The
amendments revise definition of a business. A business must have inputs and a substantive process that
together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The new guidance provides a framework
to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present, including for early stage companies that
have not generated outputs. An organised workforce should be present as a condition for classification
as a business if are no outputs. The definition of the term ‘outputs’ is narrowed to focus on goods and
services provided to customers, generating investment income and other income, and it excludes returns
in the form of lower costs and other economic benefits. It is also no longer necessary to assess whether
market participants are capable of replacing missing elements or integrating the acquired activities and
assets. An entity can apply a ‘concentration test’. The assets acquired would not represent a business if
substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of
similar assets).

Definition of materiality – Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 (issued on 31 October 2018 and effective
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments clarify the definition of
material and how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance that until now has featured
elsewhere in IFRS. In addition, the explanations accompanying the definition have been improved.
Finally, the amendments ensure that the definition of material is consistent across all IFRS Standards.
Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence
the decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those
consolidated financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.

Interest rate benchmark reform – Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (issued on 26 September
2019 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020). The amendments were
triggered by replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and other inter-bank offered rates
(‘IBORs’). The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting
requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform.

Classification of liabilities as current or non-current – Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 23 January 2020
and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).These narrow scope amendments
clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at
the end of the reporting period. Liabilities are non-current if the entity has a substantive right, at the end
of the reporting period, to defer settlement for at least twelve months. The guidance no longer requires
such a right to be unconditional. Management’s expectations whether they will subsequently exercise
the right to defer settlement do not affect classification of liabilities. The right to defer only exists if the
entity complies with any relevant conditions as of the end of the reporting period. A liability is classified
as current if a condition is breached at or before the reporting date even if a waiver of that condition is

20


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

obtained from the lender after the end of the reporting period. Conversely, a loan is classified as noncurrent if a loan covenant is breached only after the reporting date. In addition, the amendments include
clarifying the classification requirements for debt a company might settle by converting it into equity.
‘Settlement’ is defined as the extinguishment of a liability with cash, other resources embodying
economic benefits or an entity’s own equity instruments. There is an exception for convertible
instruments that might be converted into equity, but only for those instruments where the conversion
option is classified as an equity instrument as a separate component of a compound financial instrument.

The new standards and interpretations are not expected to affect significantly the Group’s consolidated
financial statements.

**d)** **Foreign currency**

**_Foreign currency transactions_**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities
at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate
at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are
translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign
currency differences are recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive
income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not
translated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognized in profit or loss and presented within finance costs.

**_Foreign operations_**

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different
from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date,

- income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates
(unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of
transactions) and,

- the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other
comprehensive income

**e)** **Financial instruments**

**_Key measurement terms_**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The best evidence of fair value is the price
in an active market. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or models based on recent arm’s length
transactions or consideration of financial data of the investees are used to measure fair value of certain

21


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

financial instruments for which external market pricing information is not available. Fair value
measurements are analysed by level in the fair value hierarchy as follows: (i) level one are measurements
at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (ii) level two measurements
are valuations techniques with all material inputs observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices), and (iii) level three measurements are valuations not
based on solely observable market data (that is, the measurement requires significant unobservable inputs).
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting
period.

Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of
a financial instrument. An incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the transaction had
not taken place. Transaction costs include fees and commissions paid to agents (including employees acting
as selling agents), advisors, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and
transfer taxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or
internal administrative or holding costs.

Amortised cost (“AC”) is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition
less any principal repayments, plus accrued interest, and for financial assets less any allowance for expected
credit losses (“ECL”). Accrued interest includes amortisation of transaction costs deferred at initial
recognition and of any premium or discount to the maturity amount using the effective interest method.
Accrued interest income and accrued interest expense, including both accrued coupon and amortised
discount or premium (including fees deferred at origination, if any), are not presented separately and are
included in the carrying values of the related items in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The effective interest method is a method of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant
period, so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest (effective interest rate) on the carrying amount.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts
(excluding future credit losses) through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, if
appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate discounts
cash flows of variable interest instruments to the next interest repricing date, except for the premium or
discount which reflects the credit spread over the floating rate specified in the instrument, or other variables
that are not reset to market rates. Such premiums or discounts are amortised over the whole expected life of
the instrument. The present value calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the
contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. For assets that are purchased or originated
credit impaired (“POCI”) at initial recognition, the effective interest rate is adjusted for credit risk, i.e. it is
calculated based on the expected cash flows on initial recognition instead of contractual payments.

**_Financial instruments – initial recognition_**

Financial instruments at FVTPL are initially recorded at fair value. All other financial instruments are
initially recorded at fair value adjusted for transaction costs. Fair value at initial recognition is best evidenced
by the transaction price. A gain or loss on initial recognition is only recorded if there is a difference between
fair value and transaction price which can be evidenced by other observable current market transactions in
the same instrument or by a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets.
After the initial recognition, an ECL allowance is recognised for financial assets measured at AC and
investments in debt instruments measured at FVOCI, resulting in an immediate accounting loss.

All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the time frame established by
regulation or market convention (“regular way” purchases and sales) are recorded at trade date, which is the

22

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

date on which the Group commits to deliver a financial asset. All other purchases are recognised when the
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

**_Financial assets – classification and subsequent measurement – measurement categories_**

The Group classifies financial assets in the following measurement categories: FVTPL, FVOCI and AC.
The classification and subsequent measurement of debt financial assets depends on: (i) the Group’s business
model for managing the related assets portfolio and (ii) the cash flow characteristics of the asset.

**_Financial assets – classification and subsequent measurement – business model_**

The business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate cash flows – whether
the Group’s objective is: (i) solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets (“hold to collect
contractual cash flows”,) or (ii) to collect both the contractual cash flows and the cash flows arising from
the sale of assets (“hold to collect contractual cash flows and sell”) or, if neither of (i) and (ii) is applicable,
the financial assets are classified as part of “other” business model and measured at FVTPL.

Business model is determined for a group of assets (on a portfolio level) based on all relevant evidence
about the activities that the Group undertakes to achieve the objective set out for the portfolio available at
the date of the assessment.

Financial assets – classification and subsequent measurement – cash flow characteristics. Where the
business model is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or to hold contractual cash flows and sell,
the Group assesses whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”).
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their
cash flows are consistent with the SPPI feature. In making this assessment, the Group considers whether
the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement, i.e. interest includes only
consideration for credit risk, time value of money, other basic lending risks and profit margin.

Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that is inconsistent with a basic lending
arrangement, the financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL. The SPPI assessment is performed
on initial recognition of an asset and it is not subsequently reassessed.

Financial assets – reclassification. Financial instruments are reclassified only when the business model for
managing the portfolio as a whole change. The reclassification has a prospective effect and takes place from
the beginning of the first reporting period that follows after the change in the business model.

**_Financial assets impairment – credit loss allowance for ECL_**

The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the ECL for debt instruments measured at AC and FVOCI
and for the exposures arising from loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, for contract assets.
The Group measures ECL and recognises net impairment losses on financial and contract assets at each
reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is
determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, (ii) time value of money and (iii) all reasonable and
supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort at the end of each reporting period
about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions.

Debt instruments measured at AC, trade and other receivables, loans issued and contract assets are presented
in the consolidated statement of financial position net of the allowance for ECL. For loan commitments and
financial guarantees, a separate provision for ECL is recognised as a liability in the consolidated statement
of financial position. For debt instruments at FVOCI, changes in amortised cost, net of allowance for ECL,
are recognised in profit or loss and other changes in carrying value are recognised in OCI as gains less losses

on debt instruments at FVOCI.

The Group applies simplified approach for impairment of trade receivables without significant financing
component and contract assets. For other financial assets the Group applies a three-stage model for
impairment, based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition. A financial instrument that not had
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date
is classified in Stage 1. Financial assets in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the
portion of lifetime ECL that results from default events possible within the next 12 months or until
contractual maturity, if shorter (“12 Months ECL”). If the Group identifies a significant increase in credit
risk (“SICR”) since initial recognition, the asset is transferred to Stage 2 and its ECL is measured based on
ECL on a lifetime basis, that is, up until contractual maturity but considering expected prepayments, if any
(“Lifetime ECL”). If the Group determines that a financial asset is credit-impaired, the asset is transferred
to Stage 3 and its ECL is measured as a Lifetime ECL. For financial assets that are purchased or originated
credit-impaired (“POCI Assets”), the ECL is always measured as a Lifetime ECL.

Range of expected rates applied to trade receivables as at 31 December 2019 and 2018 are presented in

The non-recoverability analysis is conducted for the past 3 years to determine the general default ratio. In
order to determine the default rate for a given ageing interval, the balance of receivables written-off is
compared against the balance of outstanding receivables.

**_Financial assets – write-off_**

Financial assets are written-off, in whole or in part, when the Group exhausted all practical recovery efforts
and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The write-off represents a
derecognition event. The Group may write-off financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity
when the Group seeks to recover amounts that are contractually due, however, there is no reasonable
expectation of recovery.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are
carried at AC because: (i) they are held for collection of contractual cash flows and those cash flows
represent SPPI, and (ii) they are not designated at FVTPL. Features mandated solely by legislation, such
as the bail-in legislation in certain countries, do not have an impact on the SPPI test, unless they are
included in contractual terms such that the feature would apply even if the legislation is subsequently
changed. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of
three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost less the loss allowances
determined applying the expected credit losses model descried above in section Financial assets
impairment – credit loss allowance for ECL.

**_Borrowings_**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently
carried at AC using the effective interest method.

**_Trade and other payables_**

Trade payables are accrued when the counterparty performs its obligations under the contract and are
recognised initially at fair value and subsequently carried at AC using the effective interest method

**_Capitalisation of borrowing costs_**

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
assets that necessarily take a substantial time to get ready for intended use or sale (qualifying assets) are
capitalised as part of the costs of those assets.

The commencement date for capitalisation is when (a) the Group incurs expenditures for the qualifying
asset; (b) it incurs borrowing costs; and (c) it undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for
its intended use or sale.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues up to the date when the assets are substantially ready for their
use or sale.

The Group does not have qualifying asset for capitalised borrowing costs, therefore no borrowing costs
were capitalized to the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2019.

**_Financial guarantees_**

Financial guarantees require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee
for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original
or modified terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees are initially recognised at their fair value, which
is normally evidenced by the amount of fees received. This amount is amortised on a straight line basis over
the life of the guarantee. At the end of each reporting period, the guarantees are measured at the higher of:

- the amount of the loss allowance for the guaranteed exposure determined based on the expected loss
model and

- the remaining unamortised balance of the amount at initial recognition. In addition, an ECL loss
allowance is recognised for fees receivable that are recognised in the consolidated statement of
financial position as an asset.

**f)** **Property, plant and equipment**

**_Recognition and measurement_**

Property, plant and equipment comprise mainly cable network (coaxial and optical primary and
secondary network and backbone) and customer premise equipment (CPE - receivers and modems).
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable
to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing
the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalized borrowing costs. Purchased
software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that
equipment.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing
the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment, and is
recognized net within other income/other expenses in profit or loss.

**_Subsequent costs_**

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow
to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Cost of replacing major parts or
components of property, plant and equipment items are capitalised and depreciated over shorter of
remaining useful life of an asset or period until major part are replaced again. Cost of the replaced
part is retired. All other repairs and maintenance are recognized in profit or loss during the financial
period in which they are incurred.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation is based on the depreciable amount of an asset. Significant components of individual
assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that
asset, that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
each component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the
shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative
periods are as follows:
**Number of years**

Buildings 30 – 40

Cable network 10 – 20

Vehicles 4 – 5

CPE (Head-end and optical equipment) 3 – 5

Computer equipment 3

**g)** **Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition (as defined in the note 3(a)) over the
fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

**h)** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost
less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

**_Trademarks_**

Trademarks are acquired in a business combination, recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
Trademarks are amortized over their useful lives.

Trademarks include following trade names: “SBB”, “Total TV”, “Telemach”, “Sport Klub”, “Nova TV”
and “Direct Media”.

**_Contractual customer relationships_**

Contractual customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the
acquisition date. The contractual customer relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

**_Computer software_**

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Software is recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Cost
includes expenditure to acquire software and directly attributable costs to prepare it for its intended
use.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognized as intangible assets when the relevant
criteria are satisfied:

(a) the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or

sale.

(b) its intention to complete the software and use or sell it.

(c) its ability to use or sell the software.

(d) how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

(e) the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the

development and to use or sell the software.

(f) its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the software during its

development.

Directly attributable costs, capitalized as part of the software product, includes software
development employee cost and appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development
expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs
previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period. Computer
software development costs recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

**_Programming rights_**

When entering into contracts for the acquisition of film, series, shows or sports events, the rights
acquired are classified as contractual commitments. The Group assesses each license agreement which
span over period longer than one year whether it meets definition of an intangible asset and recognition
criteria. They are recorded in the statement of financial position and classified as programming rights as
follows:

- Programming rights for films and television series are recognized at cost when the program is
available for screening and are expensed over their broadcasting period.

- Sports rights are recognized at cost at the opening of the broadcasting period of the related sports
season start or contract date if season start is not defined in the contract itself. If the licence
agreement spans over more than one year, the Group will recognize programming rights only to the
level of assets available for broadcasting (e.g. one season).

- Own-produced programming rights are capitalized on the balance sheet at cost which are directly
related to the project being developed such as direct external development costs, allocated costs of

27

employees and development overhead pool directly attributable to preparing the asset for use and
will be amortized based on program viewership forecast method

The amortization charge for each period should be recognized in profit or loss statement as amortization
of programming rights.

Advance payments for acquired programming assets, prior to licence begin date, are recognized as
prepayments for programming assets.

Signed and binding contracts for purchase of programming, which do not meet recognition criteria for
programming assets are not recognized in the balance sheet and are instead disclosed as contractual
commitments in the amount of the outstanding contract liability at the reporting date.

**_Subscriber acquisition cost_**

Subscriber acquisition include costs associated with entering into sales contracts with new customers,
for example commissions paid to internal or external sales personnel. Intangible assets are recognized
only for costs that are incremental to obtaining the contract. Amortization is calculated using the
straight-line method over the expected life of the customer relationship.

**_Radio frequency rights_**

Property rights relates to rights to radio frequencies in Slovenia. The company uses the cost model and
thus manages intangible assets at their purchase values less depreciation adjustments following the
straight-line amortization method. Any intangible assets that meet the conditions for recognition are
valued at cost upon initial recognition. Property rights are amortized in a period of 10 years.

**_Subsequent expenditure_**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when satisfy the conditions for recognition as an asset. All
other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized
in profit or loss as incurred.

**_Amortization_**

Amortization is based on the depreciable amount of an asset and is calculated using straight-line method
(except for own-produced programming rights, see above) to allocate their cost over their estimated useful
lives, except for television programming rights which are amortised based on program viewership forecast
method. Useful life of these assets is presented in table below

**Number of years**

Trademark 15

Customer relationship – Cable 5 – 12

Customer relationship – DTH 8

Programming rights (other than own production) 2 – 4

Subscriber acquisition costs 2 – 12

Radio frequencies 10

Software & licenses 3 – 5

The useful lives of customer relations for cable and DTH are estimated through valuation exercise
using the income approach based upon current market conditions.

Television programming rights (own production) are amortized 80% in the first run and remaining 20% in
further runs.

Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.

**i)** **Inventories**

Inventories comprise of materials for construction, mobile handsets, CPEs (Customer Premise
Equipment – mainly modems and receivers) for sale and television programming rights.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes
the cost of purchase, transport and expenses incurred in bringing the inventory to its present condition
and location. The cost is based on the weighted-average method. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling
expenses.

Television programming rights represents content for short-term use, including acquired and ownproduced programming rights used in the normal course of business.

The Group writes down for slow-moving or obsolete inventories based on inventory turnover ratios and
management’s best judgments regarding future usage plans of inventories.

**j)** **Impairment of non-financial assets**

The Group expensed short term programming rights based on schedule and number of airings: one airing
– 100%; two airings 70% and 30%; three airings – 50%, 28% and 22% Non-financial assets, except for
deferred tax assets, income tax receivable and inventories are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s or CGU’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
This impairment test is performed to compare the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating
Unit (CGU) or, if necessary in cases of goodwill, CGU to the carrying value of the CGU (including
goodwill, if goodwill has been allocated to CGU or group of CGUs). A CGU is the smallest

29


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash
inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the discounted value of future
cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) by using cash flow projections consistent with
the budget of the following year, the most recent forecasts prepared by the operating segments and
long-term projections.

Applied discount rates are determined by reference to available external sources of information,
usually based on financial institutions’ benchmarks, and reflect the current assessment by the Group
of the time value of money and risks specific to each asset or group of assets. Perpetual growth
rates used for the evaluation of CGUs are those used to prepare budgets for each CGU or group of
CGUs, and beyond the period covered, are consistent with growth rates estimated by the business
by extrapolating growth rates used in the budgets, without exceeding the long-term average growth
rate for the markets in which the group operates. The fair value (less costs to sell) is the price that
would be received from the sale of an asset or group of assets in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date, less costs to sell. These values are generally
determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices or comparison with similar listed
companies, with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent transactions) or, in the
absence of such data, on the basis of discontinued cash flows. If the recoverable amount is lower
than the carrying value of an asset or group of assets, an impairment loss equal to the difference is
recognized in statement of profit and loss. In the case of a group of assets, this impairment loss is
first recorded against goodwill. The impairment losses recognized in respect of property, plant and
equipment, and intangible assets (other than goodwill) may be reversed in a later period if the
recoverable amount becomes greater than the carrying value, within the limit of impairment losses
previously recognized. Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed at
a later date. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Non-financial assets,
excluding goodwill, that suffered impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
reporting date.

CGUs are independently defined at each business level, corresponding to the group operating segments.
An impairment test of goodwill is performed by the Group for each CGU or group of CGUs, depending
on the level at which management measures return on operations.

**k)** **Employee benefits**

In accordance with the regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group operates, the Group has
an obligation to pay contributions to various state social security funds. These obligations involve the
payment of contributions on behalf of the employee, by the employer in an amount calculated by applying
the specific, legally prescribed rates. Entities within the Group are also legally obligated to withhold
contributions from gross salaries to employees, and on their behalf to transfer the withheld portions
directly to the appropriate government funds. These contributions payable on behalf of the employee and
employer are charged to expenses in the period in which they arise.

The Group does not operate any private pension scheme or post retirement defined contribution plan.

In certain countries of operations, the Group is obliged to pay to employees defined by the law one-of
retirement payment. The calculation of retirement payments provided by the Law is performed annually
by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Group has made an

30


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

offer of voluntary redundancy, if it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of
acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting
date, then they are discounted to their present value.

Accumulating compensated absences may be carried forward and used in future periods if the current
period’s entitlement has not been fully used. The expected cost of accumulated compensated absences
is recognized in the amount that is expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement that has
accumulated as of the consolidated statement of financial position date.

In the instance of non-accumulating compensated absences, no liability or expense is recognized until
the time of the absence.

**l)** **Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation;
and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provisions due to passage of time is recognized as
interest expense.

**m)** **Revenue**

The Group’s process for revenue recognition from multi-element contracts (e.g. mobile service and handset)
consists of:

- assessment of all goods and services provided to the subscriber under the contract and identifying
separate performance obligations in that contract,

- determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the contract;
the allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be
obtained if the promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction.

In determining the transaction price, the Group shall adjust the promised amount of consideration for the
effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either
explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer
of goods or services to the customer. In those circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing
component. However, based on the management analysis and considered factors noted in IFRS 15.61, at
present, the financing component is considered to be immaterial of handset and would not materially change
the amount of revenue that should be recognized in relation to a contract with a customer and thus, there is
no need to determine the present value of future cash flows from handset to calculate the initial value of the
contract asset. The Group will continue to monitor contract offerings and mobile business models

**_Subscription fee revenues_**

Revenue from subscription services consists primarily of monthly fees paid by subscribers for provision of
telecommunication service. These revenues are recognized within the profit or loss in proportion to the
length service provided (subscription fee) over time in the period when related services are rendered.

The Group generates following main subscription-based service revenue streams which are recognized in
the period when the service is provided: Cable TV (CATV), Digital TV (D3), cable and fibre Internet

31


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

service, satellite TV (Direct to Home - DTH) and mobile telephony service.

_Mobile telephone service revenues_

Revenues from the rendered services relate to mobile services containing amounts charged to post-paid plan
customers for monthly service fees, which includes: voice, data and SMS.

Based on IFRS 15, revenue should follow performance and not timing of payment, as the Group has
obligation to provide service to the customer. The revenue is recognized over time and only to the extent of
provided service, and remaining of the consideration received is deferred. Mobile phone service is a “stand
ready” obligation” and the obligation is satisfied by passage of time so the fixed monthly fee is spread
straight line over the time of the contract. The fee charged additionally for telephone conversation and SMS
is a variable consideration which is recognized as revenue when the even usage giving rise to such fee
occurs.

Handsets subsidized represents a distinct performance obligation and realization of revenues to each
performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is required. The subsidy of the hardware
leads to the recognition of a contract asset under IFRS 15. The total consideration allocated to this
performance obligation based on the relative stand- alone selling prices of performance obligations within
this contract and amount accrued at this point is recognised as contract asset. The IFRS 15 adjustment results
in revenue recognition from the sale of hardware at the contract inception and the recognition of contract
asset in the balance sheet. During the minimum contract duration (two years) contract asset is settled from
the monthly service fee paid by the customer.

The Group uses the practical expedient under IFRS15 and recognizes fee from voice, data and SMS in the
amount to which the Group has a right to invoice.

**_Carriage fees_**

Carriage fee revenue relates to sales of pay-tv channel to other cable operators. The Group is the owner
of pay-tv channels including brands like “Sport Klub”, movie channel “Cinemania”, children channel
“Pikaboo” and music channel “Grand”.

Revenue is recognized over the time, depending on a contract, either on straight-line basis over the sales
contract period when the fixed fee is contracted or number of subscribers multiplied by agreed price per
user.

**_Advertising revenue_**

Advertising revenue is derived primarily from broadcasting of advertising content and is recognized over
the time when the advertising is broadcast. Revenue is recognized in profit or loss in the amount due from
customers net of value added tax and any rebates granted, which is highly probable that it will not be
reversed.

**_Media selling_**

Media selling revenue relates to selling of advertising space in any communication platform, such as
newspapers, magazines, outdoor billboards and screens, event sponsorship, commercial radio or television,
business information/data and online/digital. The Group acts as principal in media selling (note 6). Media
selling revenue is recognized over the time of providing the service.

32

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

**_Revenue from sale of handset_**

Revenue from sale of handset is recognized at point in time when the control is transferred to the buyer
which usually is the moment when the customer obtains the handset.

**_Other revenue_**

Other revenue mainly arises from lease of cable network and represents lease component accounted for
under IFRS 16.

**_Contract assets and contract liabilities arising from the contracts with the customers_**

The contract assets arise mainly from:
- the sales of the subsidised handsets – the revenue is recognised when the customer obtains the
handset whereas the payment is obtained over the period for which the customer has committed
the mobile services which usually is two years.

- uneven payments relating to discounts provided to customers.

The contract liability is recognised in relation to advertising, media selling, carriage fee and subscription
due to payments received at the inception of the contract whereas the revenue is recognised over time
which usually is 12 months.

**n)** **Costs**

Content and link and interconnection costs are recorded as the services are provided.

**_Content costs_**

Content cost relates to (i) royalty fees paid to broadcasting organizations for their TV content, (ii) fees to
broadcasting companies or (iii) own production of content for short term use. The Group has separate
contracts with broadcasting organizations which define conditions under which programs will be broadcast.

**_Link and interconnection costs_**

Link and interconnection costs are recorded based on the Group’s contractual agreements with its
vendors for internet link capacity and mobile network usage. Costs are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the contract period.

**o)** **Finance income and finance costs**

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested (including short-term bank deposits),
and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognized as it accrues in profit or loss.

Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and foreign currency losses. Borrowing
costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset
are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Interest paid on borrowings, bonds and lease is classified as operating cash outflow in the consolidated
statement of cash flow.

**p)** **Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in profit or loss except to the
extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable

33


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the
declaration of dividends.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred
tax is not recognized for:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss,

- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to
the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences
when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same
taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets
on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

**q)** **Segment reporting**

An operating segment is a component of the Group:

- that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses that relate to
transactions with any of the Group’s other components,

- whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Makers
and

- for which discrete financial information is available.

resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

**r)** **Tax exposures**

The Group applies IFRIC 23 in assessment of uncertain tax position. The Group determines whether to
consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax
treatments based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. In determining the
approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty, an entity might consider, for example, (a)
how it prepares its income tax filings and supports tax treatments; or (b) how the entity expects the
taxation authority to make its examination and resolve issues that might arise from that examination.

In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profit (tax
loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, the Group assumes that a taxation
authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related
information when making those examinations. When the Group concludes it is probable that the taxation
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss),
tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or
planned to be used in its income tax filings.

When the Group concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax
treatment, the Group reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss),
tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty
for each uncertain tax treatment by using either of the following methods, depending on which method
the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty:

a) the most likely amount—the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The most
likely amount may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if the possible outcomes are binary
or are concentrated on one value.

b) the expected value—the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible
outcomes. The expected value may better predict the resolution of the uncertainty if there is a range
of possible outcomes that are neither binary nor concentrated on one value.

When uncertain tax treatment affects current tax and deferred tax (for example, if it affects both taxable
profit used to determine current tax and tax bases used to determine deferred tax), the Group makes
consistent judgements and estimates for both current tax and deferred tax.

**4.** **Change of accounting policy**

This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements and also discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019,
where they are different to those applied in prior periods.

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its
obligation to make lease payments.

There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items available on the
voluntary basis. The Group has elected to apply those exemption therefore the payments associated with
all short-term leases and leases of a low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense
in profit or loss. Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets
comprise IT-equipment, computers, mobile phones etc.

The Group elected the following practical expedients:

- no adjustment on transition for leases for which the underlying asset is of low-value;

- no adjustment on transition for leases of short term;

- exempt leases for which the lease term end within 12 months after the date of initial application and
account those as short-term leases;

- a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics;

- adjust the right-of-use asset for any recognized onerous lease provisions, instead of performing an
impairment review;

- exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset;

- use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or
terminate;

- does not separate non-lease components for all classes of assets.

Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard – i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as
finance or operating leases.

_Accounting policy applied until 31 December 2018_

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the
Group as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to
profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group
as lessee are classified as finance leases. At the commencement of the lease term, finance leases are
recognised as assets and liabilities in statement of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value
of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at
the inception of the lease.

_Accounting policy applied from 1 January 2019_

Leases are recorded as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased
asset is available for use by the Group.

36


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments for the right of use the
underlying asset during the lease term:

- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;

- Variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;

- Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonable certain to exercise that option;

- Payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that
option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be
determined, otherwise the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is applied.

For the incremental borrowing rate, the Group considered the rate of interest that it would have to pay
to borrow, over a similar term and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a
similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. When calculating the
incremental borrowing rate, the Group considered the rate at which the entity borrows funds (bond rate)
and does not reflect the cost of equity finance.

As at 1 January 2019, the Adria Midco BV (the Group) had three tranches of euro denominated corporate
bonds outstanding. Two of secured bond notes (secured with UG subsidiaries’ property, equipment,
intangible assets and receivables) had a fixed interest of 4.375% and 4.875% respectively and mature in
2022 and 2024, respectively. Length of the Group leases range from 2 to 29.6 years. The third tranche,
which has a floating rate, does not significantly differ in terms. In general, these bonds best reflect the
rate at which the Group could borrow funds and also reflects secured borrowing (rather than an
unsecured borrowing or a general line of credit).

Two of secured bond notes have been used as a starting point, base rate. No additional adjustment was
required, due to the fact that the lessor effectively has security of owning the asset and no highly illiquid
asset have been leased. For determining appropriate lease terms, linear interpolation / extrapolation has
been used as one of the simpler methods to estimate rates beyond the original observation range.

Weighted average incremental borrowing rates used at the date of 1 January 2019 and first application
of IFRS 16 was 5.5% for EUR as majority of lease contracts.

The lease term is a non-cancellable period of a lease; extension options or periods after termination
options are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or not
terminated.

In determining the lease term, management considers all fact and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. The assessment is
reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this
assessment and that is within the control of the Group.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to
profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability for each period.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

Right-of-use assets are measured initially at cost comprising the following:

- The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received,

- Any initial direct costs,

- Restoration costs.

Subsequently, the right-of-use asset measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses, and adjusted for reassessment of the lease liability due to reassessment or lease
modifications. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the
lease term on a straight-line basis.

Depreciation rates for right-of-use asset as per asset classes are as follows:

- Properties: 4% to 93%;

- Base stations: 3% to 93%;

- Machinery and equipment: 17%;

- Optical fibres: 7% to 52%

- Satellite transponder: 17%

- Motor vehicles: 20% to 80%

- Water surface 13%.

_Definition of lease_

Previously, the Group determined at contract inception whether an arrangement was or contained a lease
under the IFRIC 4 and IAS 17. The Group now assesses whether the contract is or contains lease based
on the new definition of lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys
a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration.

The Group applies the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This
means that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identified as
leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

_As a lessee_

The Group leases many assets including properties, satellite capacity, facilities and infrastructure which
were previously recognized under operating lease.

Leases are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions
(including termination and renewal rights). The main lease features are summarised below:

- Properties are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 23 years, starting from the date of first
implementation of IFRS 16. The contracts contain an option to renew the lease. The majority of
lease payments are fixed, some with variable part based on index or rate.

- Base stations are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 30 years, starting from the date of first
implementation. The lease payments are fixed or fixed with variable part based on index or rate.

- Machinery and equipment are leased for one to eight years, starting from the date of first
implementation. The leased payments are fixed.

- Optical fibres are rented for the fixed period of 1 to 15 years. The lease payments are fixed.

38

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

- The satellite transponder lease is for six years, starting from the date of first implementation. The
leased payments are fixed.

- Motor vehicles are leased for the fixed period of 1 to 4 years, starting from the date of first
implementation. The leased payments are fixed.

- The right of use of a water surface for laying optical network and cable-distribution system for period
of 10 years. The lease payments are fixed.

- Use of under land surface owned by local municipality for placing the cables for period of 12
months, with extension option. The lease payment is variable, not based on rate or index.

Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease, and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between
actual lease payments and the expense recognised.

Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of satellite, office
facilities, part of infrastructure, as well base stations and the right of use of a water and land surface.
The nature of expenses related to those leases has been changed because the Group will recognise a
depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.

###### Where the Group is a lessor in a lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the lessee, the assets leased out does not present identifiable assets, though it is used by the Group as well, e.g. cable network.

_Transition and impacts on transition_

The Group applies the simplified transition approach and does not restate comparative amounts for the
year prior to first adoption. Right-of-use assets for property leases is measured on transition as if the
new rules had always been applied. All other right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of the lease
liability on adoption (adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses).

For leases that were classified as finance leases applying IAS 17, the carrying amount of the right-ofuse asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application is the carrying amount of the lease asset
and lease liability immediately before that date measured applying IAS 17. For those leases, the Group
account for the right-of-use asset and the lease liability applying IFRS 16 from the date of initial
application.

The change in accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet on 1 January 2019:

**1-Jan-19**

**5.** **Financial risk management**

**Overview**

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

  - credit risk,

  - liquidity risk, and

  - market risk.

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management
of capital. There is no change of financial risk and financial risk management compared to
consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2018.

**Risk management framework**

The Group’s managing board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the
Group’s risk management framework, and development and monitoring of the Group’s risk management
policies.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by
the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions
and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures,
aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand
their roles and obligations.

The finance function monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures,
and provides top management with feedback regarding the performance of the framework in relation to
the risk faced by the Group.

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, contract assets, cash and cash equivalents held at banks, loans and off-balance sheet guarantees.

Further disclosure relating to credit risk is presented in the note 22.

**_Trade and other receivables (including contract assets)_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. The Group assesses that it has no significant concentration of credit risk due to its exposure to
a broad customer base in each service line. No concentration of credit risk on a geographical basis is
assessed as material. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure for each
customer including services disconnection procedure.

The Group’s risk procedure limits the credit risk through short credit period available (invoices are due for
payment within 15 days from the date of issue) and 3 levels of dunning letters in different time intervals.
The Group outsourced collection activities of all receivables which are overdue more than 6 months to
collection company.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

The Group held cash and cash equivalents of EUR 250,058 thousand as 31 December 2019 (31 December
2018: EUR 43,430 thousand) with reputable local commercial banks, which represents its maximum
credit exposure on these assets. Out of the total amount of cash and cash equivalents, the amount of
EUR 207 million is placed on escrow account for the purpose of the acquisition of Tele2 (note 29).
Management actively monitors credit risk exposure and given that the Group only has invested in bank
deposits management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

**b)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated
with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity
to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they
fall due, which has been achieved through appropriate bank arrangements (note 32). Typically, the Group
seeks to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected current liabilities as they fall due,
including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme
circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.

The Group has covenants relating to Revolving Credit Facility and bonds. Covenants relating to bonds are
active only when the Group decides to issue new bonds or refinance old one. Covenants relating to RCF
are monitored regularly (note 32).

The liquidity table presenting the contractual maturities of financial liabilities at undiscounted amounts is
presented in the note 22.

**c)** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The
objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimizing the return.

_i)_ _Currency risk_

Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are
denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Group entity holding the asset or
obligation.

Different entities within the Group have different functional currencies, based on the underlying
economic conditions of their operations. Other than Euro, which is the Company’s functional
currency, the Group’s subsidiaries have local functional currencies: Serbian dinar (“RSD”),
Croatian kuna (“HRK”) and Swiss franc (“CHF”). Accordingly, the main exposure to currency risk
comes from relates to purchases and borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars,
while a significant share of the Group’s revenue is denominated in Serbian dinars. The Group has
exposure to currency fluctuation (depreciation) of RSD (Serbian dinar) to Euro given that it has
significant operations through SBB Serbia for which RSD is the functional currency and that has
significant borrowings in Euro. The Group’s currency risk policy for this exposure is implemented

through regular price adjustments on the Serbian market, following the depreciation of Serbian dinar
against Euro.

The following table presents sensitivities of profit or loss and equity to reasonably possible changes in
exchange rates applied at the end of the reporting period relative to the functional currency of the
respective Group entities, with all other variables held constant:

**Total** 28,062 24,711

The Group is not in a position to effectively mitigate all currency risks due to absence of relevant
financial products in the countries of operations (e.g. Serbia).

_ii)_ _Price risk_

The Group is not exposed to material price risks on its financial instruments.

_iii)_ _Interest rate risk_

The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings, loans to related parties issued
at variable rates and lease liabilities, whereas the borrowings at the fixed rate are exposed to fair value
risk nevertheless it does not impact the financial statements as these borrowings are measured at
amortised cost. The Group closely monitors current market rates in order to minimize negative effects of
significant movements in market rates. The Group does not use these instruments for speculative purposes.

As at 31 December 2019, if interest rates on currency denominated borrowings (with floating rate) had
been 1% higher with all other variables held constant, net profit for the year would have been EUR
4,289 thousand lower (2018: EUR 3,596 thousand).

**Capital management**

Due to the structure of long-term financing through leveraged buyout arrangement, the management
policy is to maintain a stable return on investment so as to maintain investor, creditor and market
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Group’s performance management is
focused on generating budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as well as maintaining overall liquidity position to
repay the financial debt (note 22). An important key performance indicator for the communication with
investors, analysts, and rating agencies is Net leverage (calculated as Adjusted Net Debt to Annualized
Last Two Quarters Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA). This ratio stood at 4.71x at December 31, 2019
(December 31, 2018: 4.88x). Annualized Last Two Quarters Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Debt
are non-GAAP figures not governed by International Financial Reporting Standards, and their definition
and calculation may vary from one company to another.

Annualized Last Two Quarters Proforma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA (as defined
in note 7) adjusted for the reasonably anticipated synergies and cost savings from acquired companies,
mainly Tele2, as though the full effect of synergies and cost savings were realized on the first day of the
relevant period.

Adjusted Net Debt represents total debt of the Group adjusted by adjusted cash and cash equivalents
and IFRS 16 effects.

Adjusted cash and cash equivalents represent cash and cash equivalents adjusted by cash used for
acquisition of Tele2 and received bond premia.

The table summarizing Net Debt is shown below:

**31-Dec-19** **31-Dec-18**

**6.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

The consolidated financial statements require management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including industry practices and expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in
which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated
financial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year included:

- Impairment of goodwill

The Group tests annually whether goodwill with indefinite useful life, suffer any impairment in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Discounted cash flow method for annual impairment
testing is based on management assumptions on projected revenue growth and market research for the
relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years (note 20).

- Contractual customer relationships

The Group tests annually impairment indicators of contractual customer relationships. Discounted cash
flow method is based on management assumptions on projected revenue growth and market research for
the relevant markets, competitive environment and management strategy for the next five years.

- Expected credit loss

The calculation and measurement of expected credit loss in relation to trade receivables and contract
assets is an area where significant judgement is required to select an appropriate methodology, models
and data inputs. Details of ECL measurement methodology are disclosed in note 3(e). In the calculation
of the default rate, the Group’s models predominantly use historical information which is derived from
the Group’s systems of market data.

- Recognition of revenue and allocation of transaction price

The Group is determining and allocating the transaction prices to separate performance obligations in the
contract; the allocation is based on the reference to their relative standalone selling prices that could be
obtained if the promised goods and services were sold individually in a separate transaction. The
standalone selling prices are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells handsets and
telecommunication services, if sold separately.

- Advertising and media selling

The Group recognized revenue from advertising and media selling on gross basis, i.e. acting as principal.
In arriving to that conclusion, the management has taken into consideration guidance of IFRS 15 on
principle vs agent as well as local industry practice. The main assumptions taken by management are
that the Group control the price and service. Additionally, local industry practice for the similar
companies and the same reporting framework, is to act as principals.

**7.** **Operating segments**

Operating segments are components that engage in business activities that may earn revenues or incur
expenses as a result of the services provided. Segment information is provided partially on the basis of
geographic areas and partially based on an organizational structure, being the basis on which the Group
manages its operations. Operating results of segments are regularly reviewed by the chief operating
decision maker (CODM) and discrete financial information is available on that level. Revenue is
attributed to a country based on the location of the sub-group reporting the revenue.

The functions of CODM are performed by the Managing directors of the Group.

The Group has five operating segments, four in cable and internet and one in media business line, which
are the Group’s strategic divisions. Cable strategic divisions for each of key markets, offer similar
services and are managed jointly since they have unified service development and marketing strategy.
Media segment represents content operating. For each of the strategic divisions, the CODM reviews
internal management reports on at least monthly basis. The reportable segments equal the operating
segments thus no aggregation of operating segments was performed for the reporting purposes.

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments.

- Serbia Group includes cable operations in Serbia and DTH (satellite TV) operations in Macedonia.
Satellite operations in Macedonia account for minor part of the overall operations of Serbia Group
segment,

- Slovenia Group includes cable and DTH operations and mobile telephony services in Slovenia,

- Bosnia Group includes cable and DTH operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

- Montenegro Group includes cable and DTH operations in Montenegro (Montenegro is viewed as
segment after acquisition of M-kabl d.o.o. in 2016, as before this acquisition the Group did not have
cable operations in Montenegro),

- Media Group includes media (including advertising) and content operations in the region. This
segment includes the results of our media and content business in the former Yugoslav region
including the results of N1 Info, Grand Production, Orlando Kids, Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH,
as well as Direct Media.

- Other segments includes our other operating business, such as Solford and non-operating holding
companies (United Group B.V., Adria Cable B.V., Adria Serbia Holdco B.V., Slovenia Broadband
S.A.R.L.). Revenue reported in other is mainly generated by Solford.

There were no changes in relation to composition of segments and measurement of segment profit/loss
comparing to consolidated financial statements for 2018.

Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is
measured based on segment earnings before net finance cost, tax, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by
the Group’s management.

EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS. “EBITDA” is defined by the Group as Profit/(Loss) for the period plus income
tax (benefit)/expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and net finance costs.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for shareholder-related costs, legal and advisory –
M&A related costs, group restructuring costs, income from the disposal of companies, impairment
charges for obsolete equipment in Slovenia, other management-related costs, specific penalties,
additional impact of application of new standards (just for transitory period) and other non-core
operating expenses, which Group views as non-operating and not recurring to the operations of the
Group (note 17).

Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (note 17) is used to measure performance as
management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain
segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

(a) Description of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenue

The Group’s main activities are providing of Video, Data and Voice services to subscribers in the
countries of South-East Europe. The Group operates in Serbia providing Video, Data and Voice services,
as well as in four other countries: Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia
providing Video and Data services.

Video service include provision of TV channel mix and IP Video streaming services, which is marketed
into basic, extended and premium packages. TV mix range from 60 to over 100 TV channels.

Data service comprise internet packages for residential and business customers, as well as various
supplementary services for business customers (connectivity and managed services, data centre and
cloud services).

Voice service relates to fixed line services to residential and business customers.

Mobile phone services relate to post-paid, prepaid, roaming and wholesale services provided to
customers.

Media Group includes content operations in the entire former Yugoslav region. Content operations
represent carriage fee revenue that relates to sales of pay-tv channel to other cable operators and
advertising revenue from terrestrial TV stations. The Group is the owner of pay-tv channels including
brands like “Sport Klub”, movie channel “Cinemania”, children channels “Ultra” and ”Orlando“ and
music channel “Grand”, as well as terrestrial TV stations Nova TV, Nova M and Nova BH. In addition
to this, Direct Media group provides advertising and media services to companies in the region.

(b) Factors that management used to identify the reportable segments

Four of the Group’s business segments are mainly based on the Group’s geographic regions, Serbia,
Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and the other business segment is broadly based on
product distribution. They are managed separately because each business unit requires different
marketing strategies and service level.

(c) Measurement of operating segment profit or loss.

The CODM reviews financial information prepared based on IFRS adjusted to meet the requirements of
internal reporting. Such financial information differs in certain aspects from IFRS:

i. Management consolidation adjustments can differ from the ones required by IFRS

ii. non-IFRS profit measures (such as earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization –
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditure (CAPEX)) are also included in the
segment report. Capital expenditures represents purchases of tangible and intangible assets,
consisting primarily of set top box purchases and other customer capital expenditure,
installations (including capitalized labour costs), cable and mobile network build out, upgrades,
maintenance and other investments, computer hardware and software and content rights.

CODM evaluates performance of each segment based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA and
other key performance indicators (e.g. average revenue per user, CAPEX) and does not regularly review
assets and liabilities of the segments.

(d) Information about reportable segment statement of comprehensive income.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

Non-deductible tax expenses in the amount of EUR 17,497 thousand (2018: EUR 15,414 thousand)
mainly relates to interest expenses over thin capitalisation rate, LTIS and impairments of financial
assets.

SBB and Telemach d.o.o., Slovenia are entities which primarily utilise tax losses and use tax holiday
for investments in plant and equipment. During 2016, SBB managed to satisfy conditions to apply for
another 10 years cycle of tax holiday, i.e. to employ 100 employees and invest more than EUR 8.5m.
In 2019, SBB is utilizing the tax holiday which reduces its nominal income tax liability by 64.63%, and
which expires in 10 years (in 2025).

SBB is eligible for investment incentives (tax holiday) according to Article 50a to 50i Serbian Corporate
Income Tax (CIT). For SBB this is a second use of this type of investment tax credit. The company met
required conditions to use an investment tax credit for the second time in 2016. The investment tax
credit is applied for ten years. Start of investment in fixed assets for the second investment tax credit is
1 January 2016. Each year the proportion for this investment needs to be calculated. Calculation of this
percentage represent the ratio of investment in fixed assets that meet requirements from Serbian CIT
art 50a to 50i (certain assets need to be excluded such as aircraft and watercrafts, passenger cars,
furniture and assets that hasn’t been paid during the cumulative period) and total investment in fix assets
(for period from 1 January 2016 - according to invested amount in fixed assets and for previous period
according to fixed amount of assets book value). The percentage which can be apply as investment tax
credit on calculated CIT is changing every year.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses, because it is more likely than not
that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom.
Overview of tax losses and deductible temporary differences on which the deferred tax assets is not
recognised in the table below:

**Impairment testing for goodwill**

In 2019, the Group tested the value of goodwill allocated to its CGUs or groups of CGUs applying
valuation methods consistent with previous years. Results of an impairment test show that the
recoverable amount of CGU or groups of CGUs tested exceeded their carrying value (including
goodwill). The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the value in use determined by the
discounted value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF)) and the fair value (less

costs to sell), determined on the basis of market data (stock market prices, comparable listed companies,
comparison with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent acquisition transactions).
For a description of the methods used for the impairment test, please refer to note 3(j).

Definition of the Group’s CGU or group of CGUs correlates to the Group’s operating segment.

The recoverable amount of each operating segment is determined using value-in-use calculations. These
calculations use post-tax cash flow projections based on five-year financial budget. Cash flow beyond
the five-year period is calculated on a perpetuity basis. The post -tax cash flows were discounted using
the post-tax rate to ensure consistency.

**Key assumptions used for discounted cash flow projections**

Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are weighted average cost of capital,
terminal value growth rate, budgeted Adjusted EBITDA growth rate and budgeted Adjusted EBITDA
margin. These assumptions are as follows:

**2019** **2018**

**Serbia Group**

Revenue growth in the period covered by the budget 5.83% 6.69%

Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA margin 51.0% 49.0%

Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA growth rate 2020-2024 (for 2018: 2019-2023) 9.0% 9.7%

Terminal value nominal growth rate 2.0% 2.0%

for value-in-use calculations (refer to the above table) changed to reflect current business environment
as more information became available to the Group.

The cash flow projections included specific estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter.
The terminal growth rate was determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound
annual Adjusted EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumptions that a market participant would
make.

Budgeted Adjusted EBITDA was estimated taking into account past experience, adjusted as follows:

  - Revenue growth was projected taking into account the growth levels over the past three years
and market research for the relevant markets, competitive environment and management
strategy for the next five years.

  - Corporate costs not included in individual CGU. Therefore, it shows the cash outflows from the
continuing use of the assets.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The management has identified that there are no reasonably possible changes in a key business and
valuation assumptions in Serbia Group, Slovenia Group and Media Group which could cause the
carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

For Bosnia Group, if WACC would increase for 2% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable
amount by EUR 5,199 thousand.

For Montenegro Group, if WACC would increase for 2% carrying amount would exceed the recoverable
amount by EUR 890 thousand.

for cross selling additional services which is expected to lead to increase of revenues and cost reduction.
These are expected from enhanced ownership of local content, improving the Group’s production
capabilities, cost synergy opportunity through joint production. Media operating segment, to which
goodwill from the acquisitions of Nova TV d.o.o. and Direct Media Group will be allocated, represents
the lowest level at which it will be managed and monitored.

Due to the large number of customers and the high level of diversification of the trade and other
receivables, including contract assets, the default of any single debtor would not impose any significant
consequences in respect of the consolidated financial statements.

The contract assets are all not yet due as at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018. The default rate
applied to calculated the ECL in relation to contract assets is the same as applied to trade receivables
not due 0.2%-2.6% (2018: .2%-2.6%).

Total amount of long-term loans relates to loan to Totalna Televizija d.o.o. At 31 December 2018, loan
was assessed as stage 2. At 31 December 2019 this loan is considered as non-performing as principal
repayments are more than 90 days past due and loss allowance is based on lifetime ECL.

_Short term loans and deposits_

A loss allowance in relation to short term loans and deposits is determined individually for each balance.
In order to assess credit risk publicly available information to determine default rates. No exposure to
any significant credit risk was identified, so the calculation of the loss allowances resulted in immaterial
amounts.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

The Group holds cash in a number of banks in order to avoid concentration risk. A loss allowance in
relation to cash and cash equivalents is determined individually for each balance with a given financial
institution. In order to assess credit risk, external credit ratings and publicly available information on
default rates for a given rating of Standard & Poor’s rating agency were used. As all cash balances have
a low credit risk as at the reporting date and comparative period, the Group applied the practical
expedient available under IFRS 9 and determined the loss allowances based on 12-month expected credit
losses. The calculation of the loss allowances resulted in an immaterial amount.

**iv)** **Long Term Incentive Scheme**

- On 16 May 2018, the shareholders of ultimate holding company, Adria Luxco S.à r.l. (Adria
Luxco), entered into a Long-Term Incentive Scheme (the “LTIS Agreement”) pursuant to which
certain members of management will be compensated in an amount determined by reference to the
performance of the shareholders of Adria Luxco in the event of any exit of their investment in
Adria Luxco or Group by those shareholders. The Agreement provided a platform for a reasonable
expectation of the management to be awarded based on the performance of the shareholders in the
event of any exit of their investment in Adria Luxco or the Group by those shareholders.

- General Terms and Conditions of the LTIS Agreement included:

  - an obligation of the shareholders of Adria Luxco, conditioned upon a predetermined
accumulated return on invested capital (measured by money-multiple and internal rate of return
tests) in the event of any exit of their investment in Adria Luxco or Group, to award a bonus
payment to existing management of the Group;

   - the amount of the bonus payment calculated as a percentage of the proceeds received by the
shareholders of Adria Luxco and based on above mentioned accumulated return on invested capital
achieved by such shareholders;

  - the payment of exit proceeds earmarked for the bonus payment is to be made by each
shareholder to an intermediary vehicle in cash within 30 days of receipt of such exit proceeds, with
no recourse to the Group, including the ultimate holding company Adria Luxco; no stock options
or other derivative financial instruments are part of the LTIS Agreement;

  - no company in the Group, including the ultimate holding company Adria Luxco, has any
obligation under the LTIS Agreement to settle the bonus payment to the management. The LTIS
is funded/settled in its entirety by the Group’s external shareholders.

- On 27 September 2018, Summer Bidco B.V., an entity controlled by Funds advised by BC
Partners, entered into a share purchase agreement (“SPA”) to acquire the entire share capital
(excluding treasury shares) of Adria Topco BV (the “Target”) from Adria Luxco Sarl (the
“Seller”). The consummation of the Group Acquisition pursuant to the Group Share Purchase
Agreement which was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by
competition authorities concluded on 4 March 2019. The consummation of the Group acquisition
represented an Exit under the LTIS Agreement.

- The Group has recognized the effects of the LTIS Agreement in its consolidated financial
statements for the period ending 31 December 2019, as equity-settled Group Share-based payment
transaction under IFRS 2 – Share-based payment – as LTIS Agreement is structured in a Group
context where multiple Group entities receive services from employees. It also provides the
responsibility of shareholders to settle the bonus (share-based payment) to employees who are
providing services to several group companies.

- The bonus amount under the LTIS Agreement at closing amounted to EUR 54,468 thousand, which
relates to the period of services provided from the LTIS Agreement signing to the grant date when
all parties will have shared understanding of key conditions pertaining LTIS Agreement. The
service period ended 31 August 2019. The Group recognized in its consolidated financial
statements for the period ending 31 December 2019 related expense in the amount of EUR 21,659
thousand, which corresponds to the eligible managers’ period of service from LTIS Agreement
signing to the end of the reporting period.

- From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the period ending 31 December 2018,
the recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the amount

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

of EUR 32,809 thousand. The same amount of EUR 32,809 thousand, as guided by IFRS 2, the
Group recognized an increase in equity (Contribution from shareholder). The transaction is a noncash, no recourse transaction without an impact on the financial position of the Group.

- From the perspective of the Group financial performance for the period ending 31 December 2019,
the recognition of the transaction resulted in a lower reported net profit of the Group, in the amount
of EUR 21,659 thousand. The same amount of EUR 21,659 thousand, as guided by IFRS 2, the
Group recognized an increase in equity (Contribution from shareholder). The transaction is a noncash, no recourse transaction without an impact on the financial position of the Group.

**v)** **Additional payment**

In addition to the LTIS Agreement, the shareholders of Adria Luxco and management have agreed an
additional payment in the amount of 49,9 million EUR. The amount of the additional payment was not
directly related to the value of the Company’s equity, or that of its ultimate parent, and was not paid in
securities, but was determined as a result of negotiations as a discretionary lump sum amount paid in
cash to the management at closing.

The Group believes that this additional payment could be regarded as a short-term employee benefit
under IAS 19, however, it is the Group’s accounting policy, where external shareholders have the
obligation of settling the payment for such benefits, without recourse from the Group, and absent an
IFRS requirement, not to attribute related expense to the consolidated financial statements.

**37.** **Contingent liabilities**

As at 31 December 2019, the Group is involved in a number of legal cases in the total amount claimed
of EUR 182,242 thousand (31 December 2018: EUR 119,372 thousand).

The Group management recognized provisions for legal cases in the amount of EUR 19,712 thousand
representing its assessment of the most likely outcome of the cases (note 31) and believes that any
disclosure of the amounts provided on a case-by-case basis could seriously harm the Group’s position,
but provides details of the provisions recorded by categories of litigation as reflected below. Ultimate
outcome of the cases is inherently uncertain and may differ from the best estimate of the Group
management as discussed below.

Serbia litigations - 2,058

Slovenia litigations 10,745 12,667

Other 254 218

**Total** **19,712** **20,017**

For disputes for the outcome of which no provisions were created by the Group, the Group management,
supported by legal teams, assesses the favourable outcome to be probable (more likely than not). Below
are presented litigations which could have significant impact on the Group.

1. In 2016, BS Group d.o.o., Brus raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute is

violation of producer’s rights. According to the plaintiff, the Group violated territorial restriction
of the contract by broadcasting certain movies on territories which were not listed in the contract.

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 25,000 thousand. The final outcome of the case will depend
on the Court's opinion on legal issues related to the basis of the request and the standing of the
parties. The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative
outcome that would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been
recognised.

2. In September 2019, JKP Beogradske elektrane raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the

dispute is indemnity for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 10,000
thousand. The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative
outcome that would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been
recognised.

3. In March 2020, EPS Distribucija raised legal case against the Group. Subject of the dispute is

indemnity for using their infrastructure. Total value of dispute amounts to EUR 1,000 thousand.
The Group assessed that it is not probable that this proceeding will result in a negative outcome that
would adversely impact on its financial position, therefore no provision has been recognised.

_Investigation of the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition in Serbia_

In November 2018 the Serbian Commission for Protection of Competition (“CPC”) issued a preliminary
notice stating that (i) it believed SBB holds a dominant position in the retail market for distributing
media content; (ii) price increases made by SBB were not justified by actual costs; and (iii) as a result,
SBB may have abused a dominant position through excessive pricing. On 15 May 2019 CPC issued
decision on suspension of further investigation.

_Investigation of Tax Authority in Serbia_

On 27 December 2017, the Serbian Ministry of Finance Tax Authority (the “Serbian Tax Authority”)
started tax investigation of SBB for the year ended 31 December 2012. According to the Serbian Tax
Authority’s decision issued in March 2019, it has recharacterized interest payments made by SBB
Serbia under an intragroup loan agreement (and certain other transactions) as dividends, which would
have been subject to a 5% withholding tax. Total liability determined amounts to EUR 21 million,
including the late interest. The management assessment, supported by analysis done by external
consultants (both legal and tax experts) is that there is no ground for the claim as it is not substantiated
by the evidence and regulation. The Group appealed to this decision and received approval for
postponing of payment until resolution of appeal.

_Legal cases in Slovenia_

1. The award of 5 MHz on 2100 MHz spectrum frequency within its 3G licenses in 2008 to Tušmobil

(now Telemach Slovenia) is currently subject of judicial review before the Administrative Court
against the decision issued by the Slovenian Agency for Communication Networks and Services
(“Agency”). In court, Telemach Slovenia is challenging Agency’s decision of May 2019, by which
the Agency in the renewed frequencies allotment procedure has rejected Tušmobil’s request for
allocation of said radiofrequencies and reversed its allotment decision of 2008, coming into the
effect as of 31 December 2019. Based on Telemach Slovenia’s proposal, in June 2019, the
Administrative Court issued an interim injunction and therewith stayed the Agency’s decision of
May 2019 until the court reaches a final decision on Telemach’s lawsuit against Agency’s decision
of May 2019. The procedure before the Administrative Court concerning the Telemach Slovenia’s
lawsuit is pending. Loss of the described frequency licence would lead to capacity reduction, which

101


-----

###### Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

might cause decrease in quality of service in certain areas. However, additional frequencies granted
in 2016 (and currently used by Telemach Slovenia) would support the Group to mitigate the impact
of any potential loss of 3G frequencies due to a renewal of the licence allocation procedure or other
revocation or impairment of the 3G license that was granted in 2008.

2. From 2012 onwards, the Slovenian Association of Composers and Authors (“SAZAS”) commenced

many legal proceedings against all cable operators in Slovenia (including Telemach Slovenia)
claiming infringement of copyrights and damages for the cable retransmission of musical works.
Up to now, SAZAS initiated twenty-eight legal proceedings against Telemach Slovenia claiming
copyright remuneration for cable retransmission of music works for periods between October 2010
and December 2015. In eighteen proceedings, courts already issued a final decision awarding
SAZAS with monthly remuneration amounting to approx. EUR 0.20 per subscriber for cable
retransmission of music works in TV and radio channels. On average, SAZAS was awarded with
approx. 30 % - 40% of its original claim. Telemach already complied with these final judgements
and paid the awarded amounts to SAZAS, while filed extraordinary legal means against courts’
final decisions which are for the present being reviewed by the Constitutional Court (in nine cases)
and Supreme Court of Slovenia (in one case). In five proceedings, the court of first instance issued
judgements, which were all appealed by both litigating parties to the Higher Court, while five
proceedings are still pending before the court of first instance.

3. In September 2018, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency ruled that the Group’s

acquisition of United Media Distribution (then IKO Balkan) in 2012 is incompatible with
competition rules. The Slovenian Competition Protection Agency (hereinafter - the Agency)
ordered the Group to divest the activity of broadcasting Sport Klub (SK) TV channels within nine
months and imposed a ban prohibiting the Group from broadcasting sports TV channels in Slovenia
for three years from the date of divestment (with the exception of the existing Fight Channel). In
October 2018, the Slovenian Supreme Court issued our proposed interim injunction and stayed the
implementation of the Agency’s divestment decision until a final decision on the merits of this case
has been issued. The lawsuit against the divestment decision is pending. In addition, in a separate
misdemeanour proceeding a fine of up to a legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the Group
could be imposed for each of the next two breaches: (i) filing of concentration notification to the
Agency with delay and (ii) breaching of the stand still obligation. In May 2019, the Agency issued
decision on misdemeanour procedure by which financial fine in the amount of EUR 3.7 million was
imposed. The Group appealed against the decision and seek to annul or change decision in order to
abolish the financial fine or at least lower it.

4. In February 2015, the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency initiated a proceeding regarding

the abuse of dominant market position by United Media Limited, IKO Balkan (now United Media
Distribution) and its Slovenian subsidiary IKO Media PRO d.o.o. (former subsidiary of the IKO
Balkan - liquidated in 2016) in the wholesale market for the supply of pay TV sports channels in
Slovenia for a period beginning around August 2012. This proceeding is currently still in its initial
stages as no statement of objections has been issued by the Slovenian Competition Protection
Agency. If the Agency in this procedure ruled that the dominant position existed and was abused a
fine of up to the legal maximum of 10% of annual revenue of the previously described companies
involved in the procedure could be imposed. The Group management, supported by its legal
advisors, at this point assessed that it is likely that fine could be imposed and that level of fine would
not have material adverse impact on its financial position.

_Legal cases in Bosnia_

_Minority shareholders of HS d.o.o., HKB d.o.o._

As a result of acquisition of subsidiaries in Bosnia, the Group assumed significant number of ongoing
court disputes. The disputes are initiated by the minority owners of companies HS d.o.o. and HKB
d.o.o. which claimed compensation for damages and cancellation of a share purchase transaction. The
cases has been filed against majority owners of HS d.o.o. and HKB d.o.o. for breaching minority
shareholders’ rights. The provisional quantum of indemnity sought by the minority shareholders is up
to EUR 12,200 thousand (including penalty interest rates and costs of the proceedings), which is
determined, according to the Group legal advisors, solely by plaintiffs. Based on the advice from legal
advisors, the Group management has set aside funds in escrow account for the purpose of settlement of
cases.

_Other cases_

In October 2017 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o. by Swiss non-profit organization AGICOA for
unpaid royalties. Telemach and Agicoa were not in the contractual relation for the period covered by
the law. Agicoa claims that Telemach is liable for royalties that had been due by the companies
Telemach acquired on the Bosnian market.

In October 2019 claim is raised against Telemach d.o.o., KT HS d.o.o., HKB Net d.o.o. and M&H
Company by UFR for unpaid royalties. Telemach and UFR (Association of filmmakers in Bosnia and
Herzegovina) were not in the contractual relation for the period covered by the law. UFR claims that
Telemach is liable for royalties that had been due by the companies Telemach acquired on the Bosnian
market.

authorities and was closed on 3 March 2020.

The identification and valuation of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
involved management judgment and will be performed with the assistance of valuation experts.

The following schedule summarizes the provisional determination of fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:

In thousands of EUR (unless otherwise stated)

if the transaction agreed per the contract is not unwound, break fee up to EUR 20 million shall be
applicable (Seller shall be entitled to payment from the Purchaser - for loss of opportunity for the Seller).

On 23 January 2020, the Group issued bonds in the nominal amount of EUR 1,675 million. Bond is
issued in three tranches. First tranche in the nominal amount of EUR 600 million bears interest rate of
3.125% and matures on 15 February 2026. Second tranche in the nominal amount of EUR 450 million
bears floating interest rate of 3M Euribor+3.25% and matures on 15 February 2026. Third tranche in
the amount of EUR 625 million bears interest rate of 3.625% and matures on 15 February 2028. Part of
the issued bonds will be used for the purpose of acquisition of BTC Group and the other part was used
for redemption existing bond of EUR 575 million which matures in 2022 and partial repayment of
existing RCF.

After the closing of acquisition of the BTC Group, the Group will have RCF in the total available
amount of EUR 250 million.

_Other acquisitions_

The Group concluded agreements or signed binding offers to acquire stakes in following companies:
EVJ Elektroprom trgovina, KRS, Elcatel, Ansat Krsko, Panel and Tako lako for total preliminary
consideration of EUR 11,8 million subject to certain adjustments at closing dates. The transactions are
subject to customary regulatory approvals by the local competition authorities and is expected to be
completed in 2020.

_COVID-19_

The existence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in early 2020 and has spread rapidly
from mainland China across the globe, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activity. Many
governments across the world have imposed travel restrictions, lock downs and social distancing with
a view to reducing the spread of the virus and hopefully minimizing the number of fatalities. The Group
considers this outbreak to be a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.

Whilst inherently uncertain, and the management expects some impact to operations and performance
but currently does not believe that the COVID-19 outbreak will directly have a material adverse effect
on the Group’s financial condition or liquidity for the foreseeable future such that it is not appropriate
to apply the going concern principal to these financial statements.

The impact of this outbreak on macroeconomic forecasts and markets are expected to be incorporated
into the Group’s estimates of expected credit loss provisions and other impairments assessments in
2020, including but not limited to: Goodwill, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets and
programming rights.

Please also see disclosures in note 2(c) Going Concern.

The Group’s management holds that they are not aware of any other significant post balance sheet
events that could affect the consolidated financial statements for 31 December 2019 or require separate
disclosure.

**1.** **REPORTING ENTITY**

Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited (referred to as “Midco”) was incorporated in Guernsey on 29 November 2010 for
an unlimited period and is governed in accordance with the provisions of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 (as amended).
Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited has its registered office at Martello Court, Admiral Park, St. Peter Port, Guernsey,
GY1 3HB and is a holding company of the subsidiaries detailed below.

The parent Company of Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited is Crystal Almond Holdings Limited and is also governed
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 (as amended).

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited as at and
for the nine months ended 30 September 2021 comprise Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “Company” and individually as “Company entities”) as follows:

**Name** **Country of incorporation** **30 September 2021** **31 December 2020**

Crystal Almond S.à r.l. Luxembourg 100.00% 100.00%

WIND Hellas Telecommunications single member S.A. (“WIND Hellas”) Greece 100.00% 100.00%

Victus Networks S.A. (“Victus”) – joint operation Greece 50.00% 50.00%

The operating subsidiary, WIND Hellas, provides mobile, fixed telecommunication, internet access and TV content services in the
Hellenic Republic ("Greece"). Victus is a joint operation company established by WIND Hellas and Vodafone-Panafon S.A. in
Greece to provide mobile network sharing to both of these companies (note 29).

**2.** **BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND MEASUREMENT**

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting, as adopted by the European Union (EU). They do not include all the information required for full annual
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by
the EU and they should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year
ended 31 December 2020. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant
to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Company since the last annual consolidated
financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved by the Company on 25
November 2021.
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for
equity investments, which are measured on a fair value basis through other comprehensive income on each reporting date.

_Going concern_

The Company has prepared these interim financial statements on a going concern basis as it maintains adequate available liquidity
to continue its operations, despite the negative working capital, due to the nature of the business provided that the operating cashflows remain positive. In making this assessment management has taken account of the effect of Covid-19 on the operating
company, WIND Hellas.

**COVID-19**
During the third quarter as the vaccination campaign acquired critical mass many of the mobility restrictions that were in place in
Greece were lifted, especially for vaccinated citizens. Although certain restrictions continued to be in place, such as caps for on
site working, requirements to produce vaccination certificates or negative test results to engage in certain activities, and others,
economic activity recovered strongly and the country experienced a significantly improved tourist season compared to the prior
year.
In this environment Wind Hellas remained focused on the execution of its strategic plan, whilst delivering accelerated commercial
performance and leveraging on the improved overall economic environment. At the same time health and wellbeing of colleagues
and customers remained the Group’s top priority and it continued to implement all safety guidelines indicated by authorities
including 50% remote working, thermometry at building entry points, and mandatory use of masks on Company premises. The
Company has been recently awarded with a “Pandemic Management” distinction, for its actions during COVID-19.

At present, the Greek economy remains fully open with complete freedom granted to vaccinated citizens. However, Covid
infection case count has been rapidly rising over recent weeks and the government is considering a series of new measures to
incentivize vaccination and prevent further strain on the health system.

Wind Hellas continues to monitor the situation and to develop contingency plans should the health and safety or economic
conditions deteriorate as a result of the current resurgence of the pandemic.

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

**3.** **FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY**

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional
currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand, except where otherwise indicated.

**4.** **USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

In preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and
expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Management has applied the Company’s accounting policies and used the same key sources of estimation uncertainty in these
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as those applied in the consolidated financial statements as at and
for the year ended 31 December 2020.

**_Measurement of fair values_**
A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are
categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly

(i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are categorized in different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety at the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input
that is significant to the entire measurement. There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at 30
September 2021.

Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in Note 24.

**5.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – NEW STANDARDS**

The accounting policies applied by the Company in these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the
same as those applied by the Company in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020.

Amendments to IFRS have been issued for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2021, but they do not have any significant
impact on the Group’s financial statements. The Company, with its independent actuary, will assess the decision made by the
IFRS Interpretation Committee in April 2021 regarding the recognition of service (IAS 19) and will incorporate any impact in the
Financial Statements of 31 December 2021.

The aforementioned decision has immediate effect, and its implementation is expected to lead to a change in the existing
accounting policy. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably determine the effect of this change.

**6.** **BUSINESS DIVISION SALE**

During 2020 Crystal Almond S.à r.l. (“Crystal Almond”), entered into an agreement with Vodafone Europe B.V. (“Vodafone”)
(the “Contribution Agreement”), to contribute its tower portfolios in Greece in exchange for a 38% for the issued share capital of
Vantage Towers Greece (a jointly owned entity which, was recorded as an Investment Held for Sale at a value of €310 million as
of 31 December 2020) and certain additional payments. On 25 March 2021, Vodafone acquired the 38% share of Crystal Almond
in Vantage Towers Greece with a payment of €287.5 million. In line with the provisions of the sell down SPA there was also a
cash sweep payment to Crystal Almond of €4.9 million. As of 30 September 2021, Crystal Almond S.à r.l. has no investment in
Vantage Towers Greece.

-----

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

The increase in depreciation of right-of-use assets in the nine months ended 2021 compared to nine months 2020 is mainly related
with the Vantage Towers agreement concerning the IFRS16 related costs.

**11.** **INCOME TAXES**

In accordance with Guernsey tax legislation the standard corporate income tax rate applicable for companies residing in Guernsey
is 0% (2020: 0%). The overall maximum corporate tax rate applicable for companies located in the city of Luxembourg is 24.94%
(2020: 24.94%). The corporate income tax rate that is applicable for companies residing in Greece has been decreased to 22% in
accordance with the law 4799/2021 (2020: 24%). The effect of the change of the tax rate amounted to €266 (and €65 in OCI).

The major components of income tax (benefit) / expense as at the reporting date were:

**Income tax (benefit) / expense** **(1,229)** **(3,506)** **(3,444)** **(872)**

The Company’s effective income tax rate for the nine months ended 30 September 2021 was 20.8% (nine months ended 30
September 2020: 16.1%) and has been determined for interim reporting purposes based on management’s best estimate of the
annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year, adjusted for certain items recognized in the interim period. The
increased effective tax rate for the period is mainly due to the fact that in the prior period the Company did not recognize deferred
tax asset on tax losses incurred during that period.

The major classes of property plant and equipment are as follows:

**30 September 2021** **31 December 2020**

**17.** **CONTRACT COSTS, RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS, CONTRACT ASSETS AND CONTRACT**
**LIABILITIES**

The following table provides information about contract costs, receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts
with customers. Contract costs are incremental costs to obtain a contract, contract assets are mainly right to consideration in
exchange for goods or services the Company has transferred to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before
payment is due, like unbilled revenues. On the other hand, once a customer pays consideration or the Company has a right to an
amount of consideration that is unconditional before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer, the Company
presents the contract as a contract liability when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract
liabilities primarily arise from monthly fees charged to customers in advance, unused airtime for prepaid scratch cards, and
material rights which result from the direct sales channel for subsidies provided to customers subsequent to contract inception.

present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. The interest rate used to
discount estimated cash flows of the loan due from a related party are based on the Euro-market two-year yield curve at the
reporting date plus an adequate spread, and was 2.53% as at 30 September 2021 (2020: 2.49%).

The International Stock Exchange at the reporting date, which has been categorized as level 1.

###### Independent Auditor's Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements

To the Shareholders of
CRYSTAL ALMOND INTERMEDIARY HOLDINGS LIMITED

**Report on the Review of Condensed. Consolidated Interim Financial**
**Statements**

Introduction

We have reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated Statement of
Financial Position of CRYSTAL ALMOND INTERMEDIARY HOLDINGS LIMITED (the
"Company") as at 30 September 2021 and the related condensed consolidated
Statements of Profit and Loss and other Comprehensive Income for the three-month
and the nine-month periods ended 30 September 2021, Changes in Equity and Cash
Flows for the nine-month period then ended and the selected explanatory notes, which
comprise the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. Management is
responsible for the preparation and presentation of these Condensed Consolidated
Interim Financial Statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards adopted by the European Union and specifically with International
Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 "Interim Financial Reporting". Our responsibility is to
express a conclusion on this Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
based on our review.

Scope of Review

We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review
Engagements (ISRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity". A review of interim financial information consists of
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters,
and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing,
as incorporated in Greek Law, and consequently does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

**Conclusion**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements as at
30 September 2021 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34
"Interim Financial Reporting".

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

detailed below.

The parent Company of Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited is Crystal Almond Holdings Limited and is also
governed in accordance with the provisions of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 (as amended).

The consolidated financial statements of Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited as at 31 December 2020
comprise Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Company” and
individually as “Company entities”) as follows:

**Country of** **31 December** **31 December**
**Name**

**incorporation** **2020** **2019**

Crystal Almond S.à r.l. Luxembourg 100.00% 100.00%

WIND Hellas Telecommunications single member S.A. (“WIND Hellas”) Greece 100.00% 100.00%

services in the Hellenic Republic ("Greece").

Victus is a joint operation company established by WIND Hellas and Vodafone-Panafon S.A. in Greece to provide mobile

**2.** **BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND MEASUREMENT**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (E.U.). The consolidated financial statements were approved by
the Board of Directors on 9 April 2021.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the equity investment
financial asset, which is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) on each reporting date.

Significant accounting policies are included in Note 5. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented,
unless otherwise stated.

_Going concern_

The Company has prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis as it maintains adequate available liquidity
to continue its operations, despite the negative working capital. In making this assessment management has taken account
of the effect of Covid-19 on the operating company, WIND Hellas.

**COVID-19**

In an effort to curb increasing cases of COVID-19, the Greek Government imposed a new nationwide lockdown, initially
for two weeks, from 4 March 2021. This followed on a series of measures that have been in place on a rolling basis since
November 2020 with restrictions on mobility and economic activity tightened or loosened depending on COVID-19
caseload.

Wind Hellas continues to focus on mitigating the risks posed by the pandemic. It remains vigilant in its efforts to protect
the health and wellbeing of its colleagues and customers, with almost all of its employees currently working from home.
For those at the office, use of masks is mandatory in all spaces and thermometry is performed on all individuals at building
entry points.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

Wind Hellas continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic on its performance. Up to now, the pandemic has had a
significant effect on the Company’s operations and business performance, decreasing demand for prepaid services,
decreasing roaming income, reducing the number of visitors to Greece and affecting the Company’s ability to acquire
new customers. However, relative to other sectors the business has proven to be resilient over the course of this year.

The Company has taken action to mitigate the impact of these extraordinary trading conditions utilizing the Company’s
business continuity plan and risk management processes. These focus on the key areas of cost control, operating and
capital expenditure rationalization, cash flow and working capital management.

Whilst managing risks, Wind Hellas has also sought to benefit from opportunities to address customers’ increased needs
for data/voice, home entertainment and the transition of physical activities to the digital environment and, for example,
since the start of the pandemic has significantly accelerated its digital transformation plan.

**3.** **FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial
information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.

**4.** **USE OF JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of the Company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Actual results may be different from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized prospectively.

**A.** **Assumptions and estimation uncertainties**

Information about assumptions and estimates / uncertainties that could have a significant effect on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company are described below:

a) _Asset retirement obligation provision – Note 21:_

b) _Recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies – Notes 21, 27:_

c) _Utilization of tax losses – Note 15:_

e) _Impairment of financial assets – Note 29:_

**B.** **Measurement of fair values**

A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair value for both financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair
values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques
as follows:

_Level 1:_ quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

_Level 2:_ direct or indirect inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability

_Level 3:_ inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then
the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level
input that is significant to the entire measurement. There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy
as at 31 December 2020.

Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:

- Note 25 – share based payment arrangements,

- Note 29 – financial instruments.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

**5.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Significant accounting policies applicable to these consolidated financial statements.**

**(a)** **Basis of consolidation**

**(i) Business combinations or restructuring transactions under common control**

Business combinations or restructuring transactions arising from transfers of interests in entities or a group of
assets in which all of the combining entities or group of assets or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same
party or parties both before and after the business combination or restructuring transaction are considered business
combinations or restructuring transactions involving entities under common control. The Company accounts for
these common control transactions from the date the transaction is effective.

Assets and liabilities transferred are recognized at the carrying amounts shown previously in the controlling key
stakeholders’ consolidated financial statements with any difference between the value of the assets and liabilities
and the sum of the restructuring consideration plus transaction costs recognized directly in equity as a reserve
(“other reserves”).

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the
Company (see (ii) below). The consideration transferred and the identifiable net assets acquired are generally
measured at fair value. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase
is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the
issue of debt or equity securities. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement
of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in profit or loss.

**(ii) Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Upon loss of control, the Company derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling
interests and other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit
or loss.

**(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

**(b)** **Financial instruments**

i) Recognition, classification and initial measurement

Trade receivables are initially recognized when they originate. All other financial assets and financial liabilities
are initially recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets – classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

On initial measurement, a financial asset is classified at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL. A financial asset is
measured at amortised cost if it meets both the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL: (1)It is held
within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows ;and (2) Its contractual
terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost as described above, are
classified as FVTPL. For investments in equity instruments the Company has irrevocably elected to account for


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

them at FVOCI. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held on call with banks. The
Company considers time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.
Financial assets at amortized cost continue to be measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income and impairment losses are recognized in
profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.
Equity investments at FVOCI are measured subsequently at fair value. There is no subsequent reclassification of
fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends are recognized
as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.

Financial liabilities – classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at
FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense,
are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss.
Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.

ii) Derecognition

Financial assets
The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire,
or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction in which
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or it neither transfers nor
retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset.

Financial liabilities
The Company derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or
expire. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated
as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability and the difference in the respective
amounts is recognized in the profit or loss.

iii) Offsetting

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on
a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously.

**(c)** **Foreign currency**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the Company’s entities at exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional
currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising
on re-translation are recognized in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

**(d)** **Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are
recognized as a deduction from equity.

**(e)** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

asset and capitalized borrowing costs. Gains or losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are
determined by comparing the net proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and
equipment and are included in profit or loss. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the
future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company.
_Depreciation_
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment to their estimated residual values.
Depreciation is recognized in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis at rates equivalent to the estimated average
economic useful lives of the property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the period
between their estimated useful life and the term of the lease. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful
lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
The rates used for determining depreciation, reflecting the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment
for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

Annual rates

Buildings 2% - 8%

Plant and machinery 5% - 25%

Other tangible assets 10% - 50%

**(f)** **Intangible assets**
(i) Licenses: Separately acquired licenses are measured initially at cost and are subsequently carried at cost less

accumulated amortization less any accumulated impairment loss. Amortization commences from the date the
licenses are available for use over their estimated useful lives which is between 15-18 years depending on the
license. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and is recognized
as an expense in the profit or loss from the date the licenses are available for use.

(ii) Other intangible assets: Other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and

accumulated impairment losses. Their estimated useful lives are as follows:

a) Computer software: 3-4 years.

b) Other intangible assets: i. Customer relationships: 8-11 years; ii. contracts for fixed network connections:

12 years; and iii. the right of use backbone network contract: 10 years.

Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific
asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

**(g)** **Leases**

**A)** **As a lessee:**

The Company leases various assets, including fibre optic cables, antenna sites, local loop unbundling circuits (“LLU”),
hosting space services, shops and buildings. Under IFRS 16, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities for leases on the balance sheet.

The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset
is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted
for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the
interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future
lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option
is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The Company has applied judgment to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include
renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease
term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.

The Company has elected not to apply the recognition exemption for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of
low value assets (e.g. IT equipment). It has also elected not to separate non-lease components and instead accounts for
the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

These lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the
Company’s incremental borrowing rate.
**B)** **As a lessor:**

The Company leases out part of its right-of-use assets to third parties and has classified these leases as operating leases
under IFRS 16. As an intermediate lessor, these sub-leases are classified by reference to the right-of-use asset that arises
from the head lease and not by reference to the underlying asset. The accounting policies applicable to the Company as a
lessor are the same as those under IAS 17, Leases.

**(h)** **Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the
weighted average cost method and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs
incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price
in the normal course of business, less costs to sell.

**(i)** **Impairment of assets**

(i) Financial assets

The Company recognizes loss allowances on expected credit losses (ECLs) on trade receivables, contract assets,
cash and cash equivalents and loans due from related parties. The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis
the ECLs associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The Company measures loss allowance
for trade receivables and contract assets at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs and twelve-month ECLs for the loan
due from a related party.

To measure the ECL in relation to trade receivables and contract assets, the Company has assessed the possible
default events for financial assets by utilizing an ageing analysis, taking into account the Company’s historical
credit loss experience and customers churn adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the
economic environment.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition
and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and
available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis,
based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking
information.

Write-off: The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable
expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For individual customers, the
Company has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 180 days past due based
on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. For corporate customers, the Company makes an
assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation
of recovery on a case by case basis.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

(ii) Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication
exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset or cash-generating unit (CGU). An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or
its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss.

Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss
has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no
impairment loss had been recognized.

**(j)** **Employee benefits**

(i) Short-term employee benefits

Short term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided.

(ii) Post-employment benefits

Post-employment benefits include two categories: (1) defined contribution plans and (2) defined benefit plans.

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into
a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The obligation is
recognized as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by
employees.

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Company’s
obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, and then discounted to determine
its present value. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds that have
maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Company’s obligations and denominated in the same currency in
which the benefits are expected to be paid.

The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected
unit credit method. Remeasurements of the defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, are
recognized immediately in OCI.

(iii) Termination benefits

Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those
benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring.

**(k)** **Share-based Payment Arrangements**

The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to directors and employees
are recognized as an expense, either as personnel expenses or purchases and services expenses dependent on the
entitled person, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount
recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market
performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based
on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

**(l)** **Provisions**

A provision is recognized if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

be estimated reliably. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The
unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost.

**(m)** **Revenue from contracts with customers**

Revenues primarily comprise revenue from telecommunications services and handset sales. Revenue is recognized
at an amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services
to a customer. For each contract with a customer, at contract inception, the Company identifies the promised goods
or services, determines which of those goods and services will be treated as distinct performance obligations and
determines the total transaction price, taking into account any discounts and subsidies provided to the customer.

_Revenue from telecommunication services_
Revenue arising from post-paid traffic in excess of the free traffic included in the monthly fee and value-added
services is recognized based on usage made by each customer and interconnection revenue and international
roaming revenue is recognized based on usage made by subscribers to other telephone operators.
_Multiple-element arrangements (bundled packages)_
For contracts that include multiple elements at contract inception, (sale of subsidized handsets delivered in advance
combined with mobile telecommunication services), the total transaction price is allocated to the separate
performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of the handset and the service. At contract
inception the Company recognizes revenue for the handset upon transfer of control, which is on delivery and
acceptance of the handset by the customer. The unbilled revenue is recorded in the statement of financial position
as a contract asset, which is amortized over the contract period in the monthly service revenue.
_Telecommunication handsets and equipment revenue_
Under IFRS 15, revenue from the sale of telecommunication equipment such as mobile handsets and accessories
is recognized at the time when the customer obtains control of such devices.

_Contract asset and contract liability_
Contract assets are recognized by the Company when it has a right to consideration in exchange for goods or
services it has transferred to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, excluding
any amounts presented as a receivable. The Company recognizes a receivable where the right to consideration is
unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due.
Contract assets arise for the Company as a result of the earlier recognition of revenues in the case of multipleelement arrangements with subsidized products delivered in advance and sales through dealers/franchisees of
service agreements as the subsidy cost to dealers is recognized against service revenue during the relevant contract
period.
If a customer pays consideration or the Company has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional
before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer, the Company presents the contract as a contract
liability when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities primarily arise
from monthly fees charged to customers in advance, unused airtime for prepaid scratch cards, and material rights
which result from the direct sales channel for subsidies provided to customers subsequent to contract inception.

_Contract Costs_
Incremental costs to obtain a contract such as commissions paid to dealers are recognized as non-current assets if
expected to be recoverable and amortized over the estimated period of customer relationship. Costs of obtaining a
contract that are not incremental are expensed as incurred.
Costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the minimum contract period for mobile post-paid customers and the
average customer retention period for prepaid mobile customers and fixed services (including internet and TV)
customers. The average customer retention period is estimated with reference to historical churn rate for the
respective customer base and is reviewed at each reporting period and revised if a significant change is necessary.
Costs to fulfill a contract before a good or service is provided to a customer which are not within the scope of
another standard, are recognized as an asset only if the following three criteria are met: (a) the costs relate directly
to the contract or to an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify; (b) the costs generate or
enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations
in the future; (c) the costs are expected to be recovered.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

Costs to fulfil a contract relate mainly to expenditure incurred by third parties for set-up costs before the activation
of the services and the installation of terminal equipment necessary for such activations. Costs to fulfill are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated average customer retention period as defined above.

The amortization period for these assets is reviewed at each reporting date and revised if a significant change is
necessary. The assets are periodically reviewed for impairment. Where a contract is terminated before its minimum
contract term, any remaining asset balances are written off immediately in the statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income.

Contract costs primarily relate to commissions paid to dealers and franchisees categorized as incremental customer
acquisition costs for securing mobile, prepaid and fixed service customers, and expenditure incurred by third
parties for fixed service customer set-up costs before the activation of the services and the installation of terminal
equipment.

**(n)** **Taxation**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss
except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in OCI.
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in
respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction
that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and temporary differences
relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the
foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial
recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they
reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and where the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are
offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it
is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Future taxable profits
are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of the taxable
temporary difference is insufficient to recognize a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted
for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Such
reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

**(o)** **Finance income and finance costs**

Finance income comprises mainly interest income on funds invested. Interest income is recognized as it accrues
in the profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Finance costs comprise mainly interest expense, amortization of discounts and premiums on financial liabilities,
and, the unwinding of the discount on provisions and impairment losses recognized on financial assets (other than
trade receivables). Interest income or expense is recognized as it accrues in the profit or loss using the effective
interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the
expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, or the amortised cost
of the financial liability.

**(p)** **Joint arrangements**

The Company classifies its interest in joint arrangements as either joint operations (if the Company has rights to
the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to an arrangement) or joint ventures (if the Company has rights
only to the net assets of an arrangement). When making this assessment, the Company considers the structure of
the arrangement, the legal form of any separate vehicles, the contractual terms of the arrangements and other facts
and circumstances.

The Company incorporates its share of the assets, liabilities and transactions of the joint operation in its
consolidated financial statements at each reporting period end. Amounts charged by the joint operation to the
Company, resulting balances and transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising from such
transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

The Company has no investments in joint ventures.

**New standards and interpretations not yet adopted**

Whilst a number of new accounting standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2020 and earlier
application is permitted, the Company has not early adopted the following new standards in preparing these consolidated
financial statements.

**IAS 1 (Amendment) ‘Classification of liabilities as short-term or long-term’ (effective for annual periods beginning**
on or after 1 January 2022)

The amendment clarifies that liabilities are classified as short-term or long-term based on the entitlements in force at the
end of the reporting period. The classification is not affected by the entity's expectations or events after the reporting date.
In addition, the amendment clarifies the meaning of the term "settlement" of an obligation in IAS 1. The amendment has
not yet been adopted by the European Union.

**IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (Amendments) ‘Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint**
**Venture’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022)**

The amendments address an acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements of IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28, in
dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence
of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business (whether it is held in a
subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business,
even if these assets are held in a subsidiary. In December 2015 the IASB postponed the effective date of this amendment
indefinitely pending the outcome of its research project on the equity method of accounting. The amendments have not
yet been endorsed by the European Union.

None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. There
are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on
the Company.

**6.** **BUSINESS DIVISION SALE**

On 24 July 2020 the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Crystal Almond S.à r.l. (“Crystal Almond”), entered into an
agreement with Vodafone Europe B.V. (“Vodafone”) (the “Contribution Agreement”), a 100% owned subsidiary of
Vodafone Group Plc, for the parties to contribute their tower portfolios in Greece to a jointly owned entity (“Vantage
Towers Greece”). On 27 October 2020 the General Assembly of WIND Hellas approved the partial demerger of the
WIND Hellas business related to the tower portfolio.

Crystal Almond Towers S.A. was established and approved by the Greek Commercial Registry on 17 November 2020.
Besides business related to the tower portfolio, WIND Hellas also transferred part of a corporate loan due by WIND
Hellas to Crystal Almond S.à r.l. amounting to €87.5 million. At this point Crystal Almond S.à r.l. had two wholly owned
subsidiaries, WIND Hellas and Crystal Almond Towers S.A.

On 21 December 2020 completion of the transaction contemplated in the Contribution Agreement took place, and Crystal
Almond contributed its shares in Crystal Almond Towers S.A. to Vantage Towers Greece and in exchange received 38%
of the issued share capital of Vantage Towers Greece and an aggregate payment of €112.5 million from Vodafone effected
by way of a cash payment of €25 million and a cash repayment of the €87.5 million corporate loan that had been
transferred to Crystal Almond Towers S.A. At the same time the parties executed a sell down Sale and Purchase
Agreement (“SPA”) and a shareholders’ agreement. By virtue of the sell down SPA Vodafone received an option to
acquire Crystal Almond’s 38% share in Vantage Towers Greece at any time up to 31 December 2021, an option which
was also triggered automatically in the event of an IPO of Vantage Towers Europe, the parent company of Vantage
Towers Greece. The consideration upon exercise of the call option would be €287.5 million bringing the total value of
the transaction for Crystal Almond to €400 million. If the call option was not exercised and the IPO did not occur, the
parties would be able to unwind the transaction and pursue alternative options separately.

On 17 November 2020 Crystal Almond Towers S.A. began offering services to Wind Hellas under a new long-term
Master Services Agreement (“MSA”). The MSA has an initial eight-year term and Wind Hellas has a unilateral option to
extend the MSA twice, each extension being for eight years and the term may be extended until the lapse of a fourth eight
year term (maximum term of 32 years). The MSA describes the charges for services that Vantage Towers Greece will
provide to Wind Hellas. It also has provisions that aim to secure equal treatment of Wind Hellas with Vodafone Greece;
such equal treatment will be monitored by an independent monitor. Under the MSA, Wind Hellas and Vodafone Greece
have each agreed to commit as an anchor tenant on 250 new sites (500 in total BTS) to be built by Vantage Towers Greece
over a five-year period starting from 17 November 2020 with at least one hundred and twenty (120) of those BTS Sites
to be ordered within thirty-six (36) months of 17 November 2020.

As a result of these transactions, in November 2020 the Company derecognised a net liability of €(64)million related to
the Towers division demerger. In December 2020, upon completion of the transaction contemplated in the Contribution
Agreement, the Company lost control of its subsidiary Crystal Almond Towers S.A. As a result, a net gain of €377 million
related to the transaction was recognised in the profit or loss and other comprehensive income statement, and the
investment in Vantage Towers Greece was recorded as an “Investment held for sale” of €310 million in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position.

**Subsequent events**

In March 2021, following completion of the Vantage Towers Europe IPO, Vodafone’s call option for the Crystal Almond
remaining 38% share in Vantage Towers Greece was triggered. This resulted in an additional payment of €287.5 million
which was made on 25 March 2021 and brought the aggregate proceeds from the transaction for Crystal Almond to €400
million. In line with the provisions of the sell down SPA there was also a cash sweep payment to Crystal Almond of €4.9
million. As of 25 March 2021, Crystal Almond S.à r.l. has no investment in Vantage Towers Greece.

In Greece, tax losses can be carried forward for a period of five years. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets
related to tax losses incurred and not yet expired from the operating subsidiary WIND Hellas, based on management’s
assessment that it is likely that future taxable profit will be available against which the Company can offset its tax losses.

No deferred tax assets have been recognized for tax losses carried forward amounting to €66.1 million (2019: €42.1
million) for which the unrecognized deferred tax asset amounts to €15.9 million (2019: €10.1 million). The unrecognized
tax losses relate to years 2016 to 2020 for which the expiry dates are in various future years.

     - The Company applied IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information was
not restated and the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 for the first time was recognized in accumulated deficit at the date of initial application.

Senior Secured Notes:

Crystal Almond S.à r.l. issued €525 million principal amount of 4.25% fixed rate Senior Secured Notes (SSNs) due in
2024 under a New York law governed Indenture dated 17 October 2019. The SSNs are listed on the International Stock
Exchange (ISE).
The SSNs are senior obligations of the Issuer (Crystal Almond S.à r.l.) and guaranteed on a senior basis by Crystal Almond
Intermediary Holdings Limited and Wind Hellas.

The Senior Secured Notes contain customary high yield covenants.

Transaction costs directly related to the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes have reduced the loan proceeds and are
amortized over the life of the Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method.

Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (SSRCF):
On 17 October 2019 Crystal Almond S.à r.l. as Borrower entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (SSRCF)
Agreement with Goldman Sachs International Bank, JP Morgan AG and HSBC Bank Plc as Lenders, for €75,000 on a
committed basis. The SSRCF matures 54 months after the issue date. The interest rate equals the aggregate of a 3% p.a.
margin and EURIBOR (0% EURIBOR floor). The commitment fee is 0.90%.
The SSRCF is guaranteed by Crystal Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited and Wind Hellas. The scope of security and
guarantees of the SSRCF are the same as for the SSNs but no security has been given over the Wind Hellas shares.
The SSRCF includes a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (Consolidated Net Leverage to Consolidated EBITDA) that
should not exceed 5.0 to 1.0 tested on a quarterly basis and calculated on the consolidated financial statements of Crystal
Almond Intermediary Holdings Limited.

On 17 March 2020, the Company drew down €75 million from the SSRCF for a period of nine months. On 17 September
2020 the Company repaid €35 million of the SSRCF and rolled over the remaining €40 million, it also paid interest of
€1,150 and a commitment fee of €286. On 17 December 2020 the Company re-drew down €35 million. As at 31 December
2020, the whole of the SSRCF facility amounting to €75 million was drawn. The Company repaid the SSRCF in full as
well as interest of €503 on 18 January 2021.

**20.** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

In accordance with Greek legislation, Greek entities have the obligation, under certain circumstances, to compensate
employees upon retirement. The relevant legislation defines an amount of one-off pension benefit that an employee will
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. This
obligation meets the definition of a defined benefit obligation and it is an unfunded plan. The amounts recognized in the
consolidated statement of financial position are determined as follows:

The movement in the defined benefit obligation over the year is as follows:

**2020** **2019**

**Balance at 1 January** 5,008 7,054

Current service cost 413 648

Asset retirement obligation:
The asset retirement obligation provision relates to the transmission and relay towers that the Company is legally required
to dismantle at the end of the lease term. It involves making assumptions about the discount rate, future inflation rates
and future restoration costs. Hence it is subject to uncertainty. A discount rate of 0.68% (2019: 0.68%), an inflation rate
of 1.6% (2019: 1.7%) and a market risk premium rate of 0.0% (2019: 0.0%) have been used. An amount of €45 was
utilized in the current year for site restoration costs that was provided for in prior years (2019: €383). Following the
business division sale that took place in 2020 (see note 6), most of the obligations related to the asset retirement obligation
were transferred with that business segment. As a result, an amount of €6,382 from the aggregate liability was transferred
from the provision shown in “other changes” above.

**25.** **SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS**

**A. Description of share-based payment arrangements**
In previous years, Crystal Almond Holdings Limited, the Company’s parent company, established three different sharebased payment arrangements for certain of its directors and key management employees to purchase shares in the parent
company, namely the Original Share Based Plan (“LTIP”) and the New Management Investment Plan (“MIP”).

**LTIP:**

The stock option that was issued under the LTIP has vesting conditions which are time-based as defined in the plan rules.

**MIP:**
In previous years, key management employees and directors participated in the MIP by subscribing to four new classes
of shares issued by the parent Company Crystal Almond Holdings Limited. These new shares provided for a specific
entitlement based on the achievement of certain probability-based criteria, as defined in the plan, subject to the participants
remaining in employment with the Crystal Almond Holdings Limited Group.

In October 2020, Crystal Almond Holdings limited issued a new series of H class shares for key management employees
and directors under the MIP scheme. The thresholds for the existing classes of MIP shares (E-G), remain the same and
have not been modified as a result of the new issue.

In December 2019, Crystal Almond Holdings Limited approved a dividend payment to holders of Class A and Class B
Shares. In conjunction with this, Crystal Almond Holdings Limited implemented an interim liquidity event for MIP

participants. This was effected by redeeming all of the parent Company’s Class D Redeemable Shares and 76.8% of the
Class E Redeemable Shares. The parent Company’s Class D and E shares redeemed pursuant to the Redemption, were
cancelled.

**B. Measurement of fair values**
The inputs used in the measurement of fair value at grant date of the MIP share-based payment plan granted in the previous
year were as follows:

**Employees (H class shares)** **Employees (E-G class shares)**

Share price at grant date €0.50 €0.21

Employee exit rate 0% 0%

Expected volatility 23.6% 27.66%

Risk free rate 0.0% 0.08%

Dividend yield 0% 0%

The share price at grant date for the MIP was estimated based on a trading and transaction multiples market approach
valuation to estimate the equity value of Crystal Almond Holdings Limited on the grant date on a non-marketable and
non-controlling basis. An amount of €19 (2019: €94) was recognized as an expense of the share options.

**26.** **RELATED PARTIES**

(i) Litigation

The Company is currently involved in various legal proceedings and has claims pending that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business. The most significant outstanding legal cases are as follows:

**_i)_** **_Fixed Microwave Holdings (ex Rolaware): In June 2008 WIND sold (via the secondary spectrum market) a fixed_**
wireless access license to the Cyprus based company Rolaware Limited, for a price of €5,250. The National
Telecommunications Posts Committee (“EETT”) provided its clearance for this transaction in the third quarter of 2009.
Subsequently, EETT found that the buyer had failed to meet the criteria under the license for its use. The Regulatory
Authority resolved that Rolaware was in breach of EETT’s initial decision and ordered the license to be returned to WIND
Hellas. EETT required the latter to sell the license or it would be revoked. Following several extensions and a further
hearing, EETT revoked the fixed wireless access license. As a consequence, WIND Hellas filed a petition before the
Administrative Courts against the EETT decision in 2013 and also filed a lawsuit against the buyer, Rolaware Limited,
before the Athens Courts, claiming payment of the remaining consideration of €3,250 under the relevant sale agreement.
The Court issued a decision in favour of WIND Hellas in January 2018 and the Rolaware claims were dismissed.
Microwave Holdings (ex-Rolaware Limited) filed an appeal which was scheduled to be heard on 23 May 2019 but the
hearing was called off due to the Greek Elections and a new hearing was scheduled for 7 May 2020. Due to the advent of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the hearing was cancelled, and a new hearing date was scheduled for 4 February 2021, but this
has also been deferred. The Company is waiting for a new hearing date.

**_ii)_** **_PANOU EPE case: In May 2015, an unfavourable decision was rendered against WIND Hellas for a legal case relating_**
to a supplier that was providing power to remote base transceiver stations (BTS sites). The Court issued its ruling in
January 2018 upholding the WIND Hellas appeal and dismissing the claim filed by PANOU EPE. The plaintiff filed a
new lawsuit and the case was heard on 10 October 2018 at which the plaintiff’s lawsuit was dismissed in total. The
plaintiff has filed an appeal and the hearing was set for 2 April 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the hearing
cancelled, and a new hearing date was scheduled for 1 April 2021, but this has also been deferred. The Company is waiting
for a new hearing date.

Following the business division sale that took place in 2020 (see note 6), all right-of-use assets related to this business
segment were derecognised from the Company’s right-of-use assets. As a result, an amount of €73,643 right-of-use assets
under land and buildings was transferred (see “Derecognition of right-of-use assets and other” above). Following the
MSA agreement (note 6), the company considers the hosting space services as leases under IFRS 16, and has recognized
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of €309,136 (see “Additions of right-of-use assets and other” above).

In addition, Victus has classified the new sub-leases arising from the new tower arrangements as financial, since the new
sub-leases transfer the full right to use the asset to the sub-tenant including the economic benefits and risks. As a result,
an amount of €11,301 right-of-use assets has been transferred (see “Derecognition of right-of-use assets and other”
above).

**29.** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**A.** **Financial risk management**

The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

  - credit risk

  - liquidity risk

  - market risk

**_i)_** **_Risk management framework_**

The Board of Directors of the Crystal Almond Holdings Limited Group of companies, which includes the Company and
the operating subsidiary, WIND Hellas, has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s
risk management framework. The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks
faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk
management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s
activities.

**_ii)_** **_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers, loans and receivables
from related parties, accrued interest thereon and cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:


**Note** **2020**


**2019**


Trade receivables, other receivables and contract assets 94,525 107,688

Loan due from related parties 26 9,894 9,658

Cash and cash equivalents 155,477 47,888

Trade receivables and contract assets:
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer but is also
affected by the demographics of the Company’s customer base, the default risk of the industry and local market
competitiveness in which customers operate. The Company’s customers primarily include contract billing consumers and
business subscribers, receivables due from telephone operators and from the distribution network for purchase of
terminals, SIM cards and scratch cards (note 16). 83.2% (2019: 71.7%) of amounts due from telephone operators as at 31
December 2020 was attributable to three major national mobile and fixed telecommunication operators which are also
suppliers to the Company, where payables due to these operators represented 69.3% (2019: 63.6%) of the total trade
payables due to telephone operators. 5.6% (2019: 8.1%) of the Company’s total revenues and 10.9% (2019: 16.0%) of
the Company’s total operating costs were attributable to interconnection revenues and costs associated with these three

operators. There was no other concentration of credit risks relating to customers. The operations of the Company are only
located in Greece.

Aged debts typically arise from customer credit problems, disputes or fraud. The Company has established a credit control
policy that provides that all new subscribers undergo a credit check prior to being accepted. The Company has a system
to monitor unusual or fraudulent activity in order to minimize the risk of bad debt. In monitoring customer credit risk,
customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or legal entity,
whether they are wholesale, retail or end-user customer, aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial
difficulties. In doing so for its end-user customers, the Company utilizes a credit risk application scoring system. Trade
receivable balances that have not been collected by the Company’s approved credit period are followed up through a
standardized process which includes temporarily barring outgoing services. Non-payment, having followed the process
results in disconnection of services and placement for post cancelation collection. All customers have been categorized
in three segments based on their initial score and transactional behaviour. The treatment of each segment is based on the
respective risk factor. The Company also receives guarantees from its wholesalers and franchisees in order to mitigate its
credit risk.

The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred and/or expected losses in
respect of trade receivables. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to
individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of
losses that have been incurred or anticipated but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on
historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets adjusted by customer churn for forward-looking factors
specific to the debtors and the economic environment. An allowance account is used to record impairment losses unless
the Company is satisfied that no recovery is possible; at that point the amount is considered irrecoverable and is written
off directly against the financial asset and after taking into consideration existing legislation.

The ageing of trade receivables and the related allowance for impairment losses at the reporting date was as follows:

**Weighted** **Gross** **Impairment** **Net** **Credit** **Weighted** **Gross** **Impairment** **Net**

**average** **impaired** **average**

**270,032** **(196,762)** **73,270** **279,244** **(199,391)** **79,853**

The allowance for impairment mainly relates to end-user consumers, which is based on the ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL)
model.

The allowance for impairment of contract assets as at 31 December 2020 amounts to €156 (2019: €227) of which €87
(2019: €150) relates to non-current contract assets and €69 (2019: €77) relates to current contract assets. The allowance
for impairment has been shown as a deduction against contract assets.

Loans due from related parties
This comprises a loan to the parent company, Crystal Almond Holdings Limited (refer to note 26). The respective
receivables will be recoverable through the future cash flows of the operating subsidiary, WIND Hellas, therefore, the
credit risk relating to this loan is directly related to the credit risk of WIND Hellas. The loan is not overdue at the reporting
date based on the loan agreement maturity date. No impairment allowance has been recorded against this amount. Based
on management’s current assessment and currently available information, there is no substantial change in the Company’s
credit rating that could trigger possible default events for the loan due from related parties within twelve months of the
reporting date.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

Cash and Cash equivalents:
The Company held cash and cash equivalents, including short term time deposits, of €155,477 (2019: €47,888), which
represents its maximum exposure to these assets. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing excess funds
only in short term time deposits.
Guarantees:
The Company’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to related entities of the Crystal Almond Holdings Limited
Group. As at 31 December 2020, the Company has provided a guarantee with respect to the Senior Secured Notes issued
by its subsidiary Crystal Almond S.à r.l. (see note 19).

**_iii)_** **_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial
liabilities when due. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always
have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds
taking into account the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and projected cash flows from operations.

The table below shows the contractual maturities of liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts disclose the contractual
undiscounted cash flows:

It is the Company’s policy to delay payment to suppliers, which causes current liabilities to appear higher than
current assets. However, the Company has an extended credit facility with local banks and there is support
from its shareholder in case additional funding is required.

It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at
significantly different amounts.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**In thousands of Euro, unless otherwise stated**

**_iv)_** **_Market risk_**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will
affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

_Currency risk_
The Company is not exposed to significant currency risk from its sales, purchases or borrowings. All sales and purchases
are in Euro, the functional currency of the Company’s operating subsidiary (WIND Hellas). All the Company’s interestbearing liabilities are in Euro. The cash flow generated by the underlying operations of the Company primarily are in
Euros.

_Interest rate risk_
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Company’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:


**Carrying amount**


**Carrying amount**


**Fixed rate instruments**

Financial assets

Financial liabilities

**Variable rate instruments**

Financial and other liabilities


**2020** **2019**

9,894 9,658

(600,403) (523,808)

(121,376) (36,984)


_Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments: The Company does not account for any fixed rate financial assets_
or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect
profit or loss or equity.

_Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments: As at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 a change of_
100 basis points (“bp”) in the Company’s variable rate instruments would have the following effect in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income:

**Impact on profit / (loss) before tax**

**100 bp - increase** **100 bp - decrease**

31 December 2020 - Variable rate instruments (387) 55

Cash flow sensitivity **(387)** **55**

31 December 2019 - Variable rate instruments (107) 107

Cash flow sensitivity **(107)** **107**

_Other market price risk_
The Company was exposed in 2019 to equity price risk arising from the investment it held in Forthnet, which is a publicly
listed entity on the Hellenic Exchange (“HELEX"). This investment was accounted for at fair value through other

**C.** **Measurement of fair values**

A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value for both financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and /or disclosure purposes
based on the methods indicated below.

_Loans due from related parties_
The fair value of loans due from related parties is estimated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted
at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. Fair value is determined at initial recognition and, for disclosure
purposes, at each annual reporting date.

The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows of loans and receivables based on the market yield curve at the
reporting date plus an adequate spread were 2.49% (2019: 2.79%).

_Third party loan_
The fair value measurement of third party loans for disclosure purposes has been determined by using the bond listing
price on the International Stock Exchange at the reporting date, which has been categorized as level 1 fair value.

**NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
For the nine months ended 30 September 2020
All amounts are in thousand BGN, unless otherwise stated

**3.2. Significant events during the reporting period**

As a preventive measure against the outburst of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) in Europe, on 13 March 2020 a state of emergency
was declared in the territory of Bulgaria. All visits in certain commercial establishments such as restaurants, shopping centres,
entertainment and gaming halls, etc. were suspended for two months. On 23 March 2020 Мeasures and Аctions during a State
of Emergency Act was adopted, aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the epidemic on citizens and businesses.
While the core activities of the Group were not directly affected by these measures, certain negative impact on its financial
position and performance during the reporting period could be largely attributed to the COVID-19 related developments.
Though no reasonable estimate of the exact financial effect of the coronavirus outbreak can be made, the impacted items of the
profit and loss statement, statement of financial position and accounting estimates and judgments are presented below.
Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets increased as a result of delays in customer payments during the second
quarter of the year, resulting respectively in higher ECL rates and increase in allowance for impairment of trade and lease
receivables measured by applying the IFRS 9 simplified approach. During the third quarter of the year the receivables
collectability improved and as at the reporting date and the subsequent periods it is close to pre-coronavirus levels (refer to Note
5).

The coronavirus pandemic had a negative impact on the Mobile services revenue due to lower roaming revenue, primarily as a
result of coronavirus-induced travel restrictions. This was partially offset by decrease in interconnect and roaming expenses.
Further impact on service revenues are limited by the increased demand for telecom services during the periods of coronavirus
related restrictions.

During the reporting period the incremental borrowing rates applicable to the the Group lease liabilities were reconsidered and
no significant changes to the pre-coronavirus rates were determined. The other critical accounting estimates and judgements
disclosed in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 were evaluated as not impacted by the
coronavirus pandemic.

Potential prolonged recession and a deepening crisis could impact on growth prospects, customer spending and collection, and
may result in assumptions and estimates that could trigger material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in
the future. In particular, management expects the assumptions and estimates used in determining impairment of Trade and other
receivables, Contract assets, Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets, Right-of-use assets and valuation of Investment
property, and the related Deferred tax assets and liabilities to be affected. Nevertheless, at the date of these financial statements
the Company continues to generate profits and sufficent cash from operations, supporting its activities. The directors, in light of
their assessment of expected future cash flows are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its obligations as they fall due
for a period of at least 12 months from the reporting date. Therefore the Company continues to apply the going concern basis of
preparation.

On July 31, 2020 United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted to VIVACOM a related party loan with maturity of 10 years and bullet
repayment at maturity. With the funds received, VIVACOM has prepaid all liabilities under the SFA. As a result, VIVACOM’s
long-term debt obligation to third-party financing institutions stipulating 6-month repayment schedules and finally due in 2023
was replaced by a related party loan due 2030 which enables better liquidity management compared to the previous SFA
exposure.

Other receivables as of 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 include BGN 84 thousand term cash deposits with maturity
greater than three months for the consolidated and for the separate financial statements.

Trade receivables for the consolidated and for the separate financial statements as of 31 December 2019 include respectively

bankruptcy proceedings discussed in Note 4. The nominal value of the cash accounts at CCB as of 31 December 2019 is
respectively BGN 66,089 thousand and BGN 65,062 thousand for the Group and the Company. Their net book value as of 31

of the cash in CCB which was estimated in 2020 to approximate 21% (19% as of 31 December 2019). As a result, impairment

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss
allowance for the majority of the trade receivables and all lease receivables. The expected loss rates are based on the payment
profiles of sales over a period of 24 months before 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 respectively and the
corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and
forwardlooking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. On that
basis, the loss allowance as at 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 was determined as follows for trade and lease
receivables:

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are additional costs that would have not been incurred had the contract not been
concluded. They comprise mainly sales commission paid to employees and third-party retailers. Costs to fulfill a contract are
costs relating directly to a contract that are incurred after contract inception and serve the purpose of fulfilling the contract but
are incurred prior to fulfillment and cannot be capitalized under any other standard. The capitalized contract costs are
recognised in the profit or loss as: 1) depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the minimum enforceable
contract period, or 2) other operating expenses when impairment loss is recognized, if their carrying amount exceeds the
remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive, less the costs that relate directly to providing the goods or
services that have not been recognized as expenses.

**Property, plant and equipment and investment property (continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment (continued)**


As disclosed in note 15 BTC has signed an agreement to secure payments related to the Parent company’s liabilities under the
SFA by establishing a pledge on real estate property, which net book value as of 30 September 2020 amounted to BGN 6,850
thousand, and as of 31 December 2019 their net book value was BGN 7,007 thousand.

**Measurement of fair value**
_Fair value hierarchy_

Land is measured at fair value, in accordance with the revaluation model of IAS 16. The fair value of land was determined as at
31 December 2018 by external, independent property valuers, having appropriate recognized professional qualification and
recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.

The fair value measurement for land of BGN 5,361 thousand has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to
the valuation technique used.

_Valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs_

The valuation technique used is Market comparison - the fair value is based on the market price of properties with similar
location and category. At the date of valuation no active market existed and the market value was determined based on offers to
sell similar plots under the assumption that these are the end prices. The offered prices have been adjusted with: discount rate
ranging from 10% to 15% to reflect the actual reduction in the offered price, based on the trends of actual transactions;
adjustment coefficients, derived on the basis of characteristics of the respective plots like size, environmental and
geomorphologic condition, level of development and transport accessibility, and improvements of the land. The estimated fair
value of the individual properties would increase/(decrease) had the respective discount rate were lower/(higher) and the
adjustments coefficients were higher/(lower).

**Investment property**

As a result of the improvements and modernization of its fixed network during the past years BTC achieved substantial
optimization of the technical areas in its own buildings. The level of usage of each building is being assessed as at the end of
each reporting period. Where the Group uses only part of a property it owns, utilisation of less than 25% is regarded as
immaterial and the property is presented as an investment property. The movement in Investment property is presented below:

The fair value of the investment properties was determined as at 31 December 2019 by external, independent property valuers,
having appropriate recognized professional qualification and experience.

The investment properties realized during the reporting period were sold above or close to their fair value in the consolidated
financial statements. The Group is regularly monitoring the price trends and transaction volumes on the real estate market. As
per the available data from an expert assessment of independent property valuers the fair value of the individual real estates of
the Group close to the reporting date varies in the range of 0.85-1.15 compared to their carrying amount. The real estates in big
cities, contributing the substantial value of the Group investment property portfolio mark increase in fair value snice the last
valuation as of 31 December 2019. Based on the above and considering the publicly available information for the price
movements of real estates, and the nature of the owned by the Group investment properties (unique location, property type,
etc.), Management believes that COVID pandemic (Note 3.2) has not affected significantly the fair value of the investment
property of the Group as at the reporting date.

As disclosed in note 15 BTC has signed an agreement to secure payments related to the Parent company’s liabilities under the
the SFA by establishing a pledge on real estate properties presented as investment property, which value as of 30 September
2020 amounted to BGN 13,314 thousand in the consolidated financial statements and BGN 1,091 thousand in the separate
financial statements (31 December 2019: BGN 13,314 thousand in the consolidated financial statements and BGN 1,078

In November 2013 BTC announced the successful completion of its debut bond offering of €400 million 6⅝% Senior Secured
Notes due 2018 on the Irish Stock Exchange pursuant to Rule 144A / Regulation S (the "Notes"). The proceeds from the bond
offering were used by the Company to repay its existing indebtedness under the amended and restated loan agreement in full.
The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2014. In
relation to the admission of the Notes the Company received a credit rating of B1 by Moody's and BB- by Standard & Poor's
Ratings Services. On 29 March 2018 and 16 May 2018 respectively Moody's upgraded the long-term corporate credit rating of
the Company to Ba3 and S&P Global Ratings reconfirmed it as BB- and in November 2019 both agencies placed the corporate
credit ratings on review. On 27 March 2020 S&P Global Ratings downgraded the corporate credit rating to B+ and on 30
September 2020 lowered it to B, and withdrew the rating at VIVACOM’s request.

BTC underwent a consent solicitation procedure for a waiver of the existing change of control provisions and amendment of
certain definitions and ratios applicable to the Notes. The procedure was initiated in relation to the acquisition by VTL of 100%
of the shares of InterV Investment S.a.r.l. On 13 June 2016, Vivacom obtained the necessary consent of 87.43% of bondholders.
The amendments of Notes' provisions entered into effect upon the execution of the first supplemental indenture on June 10,
2016 which became operative on 7 September 2016, when all the conditions precedent in the first supplemental indenture were
either satisfied or waived.

Simultaneously with the bond offering BTC has concluded EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility with Societe Generale
Expressbank AD under which the Company may borrow funds for the repayment of its debt under the amended and restated
loan agreement, financing of its working capital purposes and issue of bank guarantees and letters of credit. The RCF was
initially agreed to be available up to 30 November 2016. The interest on the principal amounts owing by the Company under the
RCF is payable monthly and was initially agreed to be the aggregate of 1 month EURIBOR plus a margin of 4% per year.
Effective from 26 May 2014 the margin was reduced to 3,75% per year and from 14 November 2016 the margin was further
reduced to 1,45% per year and the term was extended to 31 May 2018.

On 22 December 2017 the Company entered into an up to EUR 365 million Senior Facilities Agreement (SFA) arranged by
Citibank N.A., London Branch and VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG (currently VTB Bank (Europe) SE). The purpose of the
facility was to refinance all amounts due under the Existing HY Bonds, payment of fees and costs under the facility and capital
expenditure in respect of the Company's investment and development program. The SFA comprised of a term loan Facility A,
term loan Facility B, a Short-term Facility and a Revolving Facility. The maximum tenor was 5.25 years after the first
Utilization under the SFA, which occurred on 14 April 2018. The interest on the facilities was based on EURIBOR plus a
Margin between 1.25 and 3.75 per cent per annum.

**Borrowings (continued)**


The liabilities of the Company under the SFA were guaranteed by BTC Net EOOD (subsidiary) and Viva Telecom Bulgaria
OOD (parent of the Company) and were further secured by: 1) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges
Act on the going concern of the Company, which included among other receivables of the Company under certain bank
accounts, insurance policies, related parties and customer receivables, as well as certain tangible and intangible assets (including
trademarks), inventory and real estates of the Company; 2) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act
over the going concern of BTC Net, which included among other assets the receivables of BTC Net under certain bank
accounts; 3) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the going concern of Viva Telecom
Bulgaria OOD, which included among other assets the receivables of Viva Telecom Bulgaria EOOD under certain bank
accounts and the shares of the Company; 4) a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the shares
of the Company; 5) a pledge in accordance with the Agreements on Financial Collateral Act over the shares of the Company; 6)
a non-possessory pledge in accordance with the Special Pledges Act over the shares of BTC Net and a possessory pledge over
the shares of NURTS Bulgaria EAD.
On 19 April 2018 the Company successfully completed the refinancing of its Notes ahead of their maturity date and has delisted
the Notes from the Official List and from trading on the Main Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. As of the date of
these financial statements the Company has deregistered the relevant securities under the Notes.

Simultaneously with the SFA the Company extended the maturity of the Existing EUR 35 million Revolving Credit Facility
(RCF)with Societe Generale Expressbank AD to 18 April 2021 and reduced the applicable Margin to between 1.05 and 1.75 per
cent per annum. The Company has established the respective securities under the extended RCF on a pari passu basis by the
same scope and type of security provided by the Company under the SFA.

On 31 July 2020 United Group Bulgaria EOOD granted related party loan to BTC and with the received funds BTC
successfully prepaid all liabilities under the SFA and the above referred securities under the SFA are in the course of
deregistration. The outstanding principal amount of the related party loan is due in 10 years. The applicable interest is payable
quarterly in arrears and is negotiated to be initially equal to 4.65 per cent per annum and following the completion of a third
party transfer pricing study - to such per cent per annum determined thereunder.
Simultaneously with the repayment of the SFA, BTC also terminated the Revolving Credit Facility which securities are
currently in the course of deregistration.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities for different taxable entities are not offset as they can not be settled on a net basis and it is not expected that the assets will be realised and the liabilities will be settled
simultaneously in the future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred
tax assets and liabilities as of 30 September 2020 and 31 December 2019 are calculated in these financial statements at 10% tax rate which has been effective since 1 January 2007.

As of 31 December 2019 the last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC was 2013. During the reporting period a tax assessment act has been issued for a tax audit, covering the period January 2017 December 2019 in respect of corporate tax, and no tax liabilities has been assessed.
The last period audited by the tax authorities for BTC Net is 2014.

**Contingencies**


The Company is a participant in several lawsuits and administrative proceedings. On 4 July 2016, Empreno Ventures Limited
commenced legal proceedings in Bulgaria, challenging the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as referred in Note 15).
Following the review on three instances, the Bulgarian courts finally dismissed the case on 16 March 2017 and the claim was
rejected. On 26 August 2016, LIC Telecommunications S.à r.l. commenced legal proceedings in Luxembourg that, among other
things, challenge the validity of the first supplemental indenture (as disclosed in Note 15) and claim damages amounting to EUR
62 million. In 2018 and 2019 judgments were rendered by two instance courts in Luxembourg which declared the request of LIC
Telecommunications S.à r.l inadmissible and declined jurisdiction, which entered into force during the reporting period. BTC
considered the legal proceedings in both Bulgaria and Luxembourg as being unmeritorious and devoid of any proper legal basis.

**Contingencies (continued)**


The transactions for assignment of receivables on cash deposits in Corporate Commercial Bank AD – in bankruptcy (CCB), were
executed in 2014 as per the provisions of the applicable law. One of the assigned receivables was utilised by NURTS Bulgaria
EAD in order to set-off its obligations to CCB under a bond issued by NURTS Bulgaria EAD in 2013. CCB held 25,723 bonds
with a nominal of EUR 1,000 each and in September 2014 NURTS Bulgaria EAD has set-off the principal in the amount of BGN
50,310 and applicable interest due to CCB in the amount of BGN 1,350 thousand against its own cash held in CCB accounts and
assigned CCB cash receivables from third parties, including BTC. Despite of the validly executed transactions, the receivers of
CCB have recognized only partially the set-off from NURTS Bulgaria EAD (BGN 1,543 thousand) where the remaining amount
of BGN 50,117 thousand and other owned cash in CCB of BGN 116 thousand is included in the list of accepted receivables of
CCB creditors. No financial assets or liabilities in relation to this matter were recognized in these financial statements. On 2 May
2017 NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified for commencement by CCB of legal proceedings for the challenge of the set-off.

On 14 May 2018 the first instance court cast a decision, as a result of which the NURTS set-offs against CCB were declared
partially null and void and partially invalid vis-à-vis the creditors of CCB. The decision has not entered into force and has been
appealed before the Sofia Court of Appeal.

On 12 December 2019 CCB has withdrawn its claim against NURTS and on 20 December 2019 has initiated a procedure for the
sale of the bonds held by CCB within which the above-referred issues between CCB and NURTS were finally resolved during the
reporting period. Accordingly a provision was recognized by NURTS in 2019. As a consequence, the bonds and NURTS
respectively were deregistered from the public register for issuers of securities maintained by the Bulgarian Financial Supervision
Commission.

After the reporting period Nurts Bulgaria AD was served with documents relating to a case that has been filed by the
administrators of CCB against NURTS Bulgaria EAD claiming the return of certain assets originating from CCB. As the purported
limitation period for filing such claims has expired and NURTS Bulgaria EAD has already settled all CCB claims, management
believes that any chance of transfer of benefits with regards to this case to be remote and no provision has been recognised in these
financial statements.

Based on the information available, management is satisfied that there is no unprovided liability arising from these lawsuits and
administrative proceedings, however there are inherent uncertainties related to the outcome of the cases. The recognised provisions
for lawsuits are further disclosed in Note 14.

The Group has bank guarantees issued to third parties which amount to BGN 9,615 thousand as of 30 September 2020 (31
December 2019: BGN 2,738 thousand).

NURTS Bulgaria EAD was notified by CCB that pursuant to a contract concluded on January 16, 2013 the Company has stepped
in as co-debtor in third party's obligation in the amount of EUR 12,300 thousand. The management of the company is in a process
of confirmation of the relevant circumstances, whereas as per the date of the present financial statements no reliable and
indisputable evidences were received for the existence of such contingent liability, nor for its exact amount (if such liability
exists). Respectively, no liability or provision has been recognized as at December 31, 2019, and contingent liability was
disclosed. During the reporting period NURTS Bulgaria EAD has acquired the above referred third party's obligations towards
CCB and thus, any contingent liability is deemed unenforceable and extinguished.
